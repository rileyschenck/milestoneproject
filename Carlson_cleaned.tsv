Weird how that works. The fake duchess from Santa Monica spends an hour talking to Oprah about her skincare regime and it's the lead of every morning show in America. Joe Biden institutes a government-wide system of  that dwarfs Jim Crow and nobody seems to notice. It happened yesterday, by the way. Did you know that? Probably not, because there was no press conference or signing ceremony, no media coverage, but 24 hours ago, it happened.  Biden restructured the entire executive branch of the U.S. government to discriminate on the basis of immutable characteristics. He made that announcement on the White House website and it proclaims that within 30 days, every federal agency, all of them from the Department of Justice to NASA, to the Social Security Administration, all of them all must ""ensure"" that they have an agency  team within their respective agencies to coordinate the implementation of equity initiatives and these Maoist equity teams will report to something called the Gender Policy Council and the White House ""environmental justice officer."" Does the environmental justice officer carry a sidearm? We don't know actually. We do know that running all of this, which is the largest racial tracking bureaucracy since the fall of Nazi Germany, will be former President Barack Obama and he'll be doing that as always through his long-time lackey and cut out Susan Rice. Rice's goal, the goal of the entire initiative, is to place the federal government, all of it, in opposition to a very specific slice of the American population, not a foreign population, our own population. Here's how it works: Every single person in the United States will qualify for one of Joe Biden's many protected categories except straight White men. So, we're all in this together, except those guys who are on the outs. It's all of us versus them, straight White men. They will not be protected because they are, by virtue of being straight and White and male, the cause of the problem. They're the enemy. So, this is a big change and it's got enormous consequences.  Among other things, it makes you wonder why would straight White men continue to pay their taxes? And by the way, what percentage of taxes in the United States are paid by straight White men? That's one statistic you never hear. Why is that?  But if you're one of them, you may wonder, ""Wait, I'm working half the year for the government, which takes my money and then uses it to demonize me and disenfranchise me from a government I thought I was an equal owner of. I thought we were all in this together? We're all citizens, but I still pay half my income to people who hate me? Why would I do that? It seems masochistic.""  Well, you do that because you have no choice. The IRS has more guns than you do. It's that simple. Meanwhile, don't expect a government contract or an SBA loan or even decent service from the clerk of the DMV. You're a domestic enemy now. You're an English-speaking version of Vladimir Putin. The equity agenda is your personal sanctions regime. It's amazing if you think about it. And someday we'll all pause long enough to wonder how this could have happened in a country that claims to love the civil rights movement and build monuments to it.But that's in the future. For now, the White House just wants us to shut up and celebrate because henceforth every official Joe Biden hires will be a first, not the first achievement, not the first in the class. No, better than that, much better —first in appearance, the first person who looks a certain way or sleeps with a certain kind of person, the first in identity. That's what matters. So, you can imagine it was with deep and justifiable pride that the administration announced that after a grueling nationwide search, they had finally located a gay White House communications director. Hooray! The news was announced by America's first illiterate White House press secretary. Watch her beam.    Yay! He's gay and that's ""very, very important."" It's pretty thrilling. Finally, gay people will know they can achieve something in this country. They can leave their jobs at the asphalt plant and head to Washington for fame and fortune. Next thing you know, they'll have TV shows on Bravo. The possibilities are exciting. He is their Jackie Robinson. But you do wonder what exactly is the difference in real life between a gay communications director and a straight communications director? Are they really that different? We weren't aware that a communications director's sex life had any bearing on his official duties, but that we don't know everything.  We called over to the White House today to see how this new gay communications director will be a massive upgrade over the last straight communications director. Unfortunately, they never explained the difference. We're going to have to take it on faith and to celebrate with everybody else. Joe Biden is doing that, as he's told us repeatedly, do not look beneath the surface. No. Appearance is all that matters. Not only can you judge a book by its cover. Yes, you can. From here on out, you're required to judge a book by its cover. Here is the print.  Well, that sounds amazing. It sounds amazing! It's like one of those old time Benetton ads. The question is, is it a good cabinet? Are they capable? No, that's not even relevant. Lloyd Austin, we should say the secretary of defense is definitely a first and we're going to give him credit for that. He's the very first secretary of defense to spend millions of dollars shooting down thrift store balloons with missiles. That's never happened, and he did it. He's the first secretary of defense to hand the Taliban thousands of armored vehicles, drones and helicopters to build them their own army for free. Nobody even thought of doing that before Lloyd Austin arrived. and of course, Lloyd Austin is the first defense secretary to wear not simply a surgical mask to protect himself from a flu virus, but also a full plastic face shield like he was welding.   You can't say Lloyd Austin hasn't broken important glass ceilings. He has. But weirdly, his boss didn't mention any of that. As far as Joe Biden is concerned, Lloyd Austin's main achievement in life is his genetic makeup. Lloyd Austin was born great. Some people just are.  Richard Levine by contrast, was not born great. Richard Levine was born a White man, which is to say, an untouchable, the bottom of the caste system. That is bad, but here's the good news, ladies and gentlemen. With the help of a wig and some falsies, Richard Levine rose above his station. He is now a she, and she is now an admiral. Talk about inspiring. Watch this. Now, the great thing about Richard Levine's new identity is that it wipes away, it washes away, not to use theological language, all previous mistakes, otherwise known as sins. Those don't count anymore because Richard Levine is now Rachel Levine. So, Richard Levine exposed nursing home residents to COVID in Pennsylvania, got a lot of them killed. He was a senior health official there. He evacuated his own mother from one of those facilities because, yeah, the plebs die, but not my mom.   That seems like a bad thing, but now these were on women's clothes. It's totally forgiven. That never happened. To mention it is dead naming him. That was his old identity.  The whole federal government operates that way. It doesn't matter how bad you are, as long as you can claim to be a first. Pete Buttigieg is supposedly the first gay cabinet secretary. Now, is he actually gay? He was dating women not that long ago. And because he is, the fact that his tenure has been a disaster for the country, irrelevant. That mushroom cloud over Ohio? It never happened. He's a first. Watch.  IIs he actually gay? No one has benefited more from these new standards, these very inflexible, genetics-based standards more than Kamala, Carmella, Carmela, whatever you're calling her, the vice president. Now, she hasn't, strictly speaking, been a success. She supposed to keep the peace in Ukraine. That resulted in a war. She supposed to secure the border. 7 million illegals later, you can't say she actually did a good job. She supposed to get Joe Biden's voting rights bill passed in Congress. She hasn't actually done a lot by traditional standards. But she's a first and that means we are forever grateful for her and actually, we are. We're not mocking because if she wasn't on the scene, we'd never hear things like this:  Did you hear that? First of all, is anyone at home keeping track of the use of the phrase ""in terms of,"" which doesn't actually mean anything? It's filler in a sentence that dumb people use to appear like they know what they're talking about, or more precisely, to give them time to think through what they're saying as they're saying it. Whatever. She's a chronic user of ""in terms of,"" but a new policy has been announced by Kamala Harris and that is that all ""non-helpful balloons"" will be shot down.  Now, unfortunately, hot air balloon season is starting soon in Albuquerque and around the country. Are they going to be shut down? Are they helpful balloons or unhelpful balloons in terms of shutting them down, in terms of vis-à-vis. Balloons across America need some clarification on that, but whatever. She's a first. Shut up. While we're at it, by the way, as long as we're trying to get clarification, it would be nice to get some other clarifications from our equity-minded leaders before the 30-day timeline on  runs out. We're still waiting, for example, for our new Supreme Court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to tell us what a lady she doesn't know.     That's pretty amazing that we have a meme on the Internet. We all get kind of used to it. This lady is now in the Supreme Court and I mean, that's not one of the hard questions, right? Like: recite the Constitution from memory. That might be a challenge. What's a woman? She's now on the Supreme Court. She's not alone. We just had a federal judge, who we think Lindsey Graham voted for, in a hearing in the Congress who didn't know what was in the Constitution, but . Now, Joe Biden apparently is trying to convince us that not only are his nominees diverse, they're firsts. He himself is diverse. Watch this.  Joe Biden spent his young years in a yeshiva. He had ear locks at the time, hitting the Torah and the Talmud. There was a Puerto Rican yeshiva that was part of a Black church. OK, so you may look at Joe Biden and say, ""You're completely incompetent. In fact, you have dementia. You can barely walk. You mistake your sister for your wife. You can't run the most powerful country in the world."" Well, shut up, I studied at a yeshiva, a Puerto Rican yeshiva in a Black church. Talk about a first! I'm a first of a first!"	reacts Biden administration equity agenda Ever notice biggest stories least attention Weird works fake duchess Santa Monica spends hour Oprah skincare regime lead every

It's just feet away. So, anything significant that happens there in East Palestine, say a  rising thousands of feet over the town, is certain to affect the state next door and that's why three days after a train derailed there, spilling a great volume of dangerous chemicals onto the ground and into the water. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, held a press conference about it.  Shapiro announced that authorities had decided to set those chemicals on fire and that was a very good thing. No one should be unduly alarmed. The burning of these chemicals, Shapiro said, had gone ""as planned."" Officials on the scene, meanwhile, declared the burn ""perfect."" Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, agreed with all of this. The people in charge, the railroad's engineers and the state officials overseeing them had everything under control. So, two days later, evacuation orders for residents were officially lifted, both in East Palestine and over the border in Pennsylvania. That was last week. In the subsequent days, a lot of people have wondered out loud, was it really a wise decision to light thousands of gallons of vinyl chloride on fire, releasing a World War I era bioweapon into the air over a populated area? Was that a good call? Was it really safe, two days later, for people to go back to their homes? If it was safe, how do we know that? Is anyone in charge actually monitoring with any accuracy the level of deadly chemicals in the air, ground, in the water, in and around East Palestine?    Well, no, apparently nobody is and that's highly upsetting when you think about it. Talk about a failure at all levels. The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. So, it's bad and it's very bad news for reckless politicians like Josh Shapiro and Mike DeWine, who may have helped make this disaster much worse. So tonight, both DeWine and Shapiro are desperately trying to revise their previous statements about the so-called controlled burn. Both have now decided that the toxic mushroom cloud over East Palestine, the one they signed off on and endorsed on television, was actually a bad thing. It didn't go as planned. It wasn't perfect and both governors have now identified the villain here, not as themselves. No, of course not, but it’s the railroad Norfolk Southern. Both are considering lawsuits against the company.  In an act of amazingly brazen butt-covering Josh Shapiro even wrote a letter to the White House and the Transportation Department claiming that Norfolk Southern was ""unwilling to explore or articulate alternative courses of action to their proposed vent and burn."" It was very obvious, he says, that there was probably a ""safer all overall approach for first responders, residents and the environment."" That was very obvious. They just never said anything about it. It's remarkable and for the record, we are not defending Norfolk Southern here. We're only pointing out that Norfolk Southern had this strong endorsement of Josh Shapiro and Mike DeWine when it set those chemicals on fire and caused the mushroom cloud and by the way, the Biden administration endorsed it, too. According to Pete Buttigieg, Biden officials were on the scene, yet somehow they never said a word about the mushroom cloud until pictures of it evoked outrage on social media and, of course, they didn't. They didn't even notice. It had nothing to do with equity or climate change. East Palestine is a poor, White town that voted for Trump. So honestly, who cares? No one in the Biden administration did care and that's an atrocity. The people whose indifference made it possible should lose their jobs, beginning with Pete Buttigieg and extending to governors Josh Shapiro and Mike DeWine. They didn't care and they got caught not caring. Even tonight, Mike DeWine clearly still doesn't care. Here he is insisting everything's fine.   ""Yes, we indicated that."" Kind of a clinical response and a dishonest one, because of course, Mike DeWine is not living in East Palestine and there's no chance of that ever. Animals in East Palestine are dying by the thousands and you don't need to be a chemist to know that's not a good thing. The town has been poisoned.  Oh, there's only anecdotal evidence also called observed reality. Maybe Tony Fauci will show up soon to lecture us about the science. Amanda Breshears will probably not listen. She lives there ten miles from East Palestine in Lima, Ohio. She says that even at Waimea, rather, at that distance, burning chemicals smell like chlorine and hurt her eyes and she also says her chickens and this is not a good sign, no matter what they say, are dying without explanation.    So as always, if you want to know what people really think, ignore what they say. Words are cheap and people lie. Watch what they do. Mike DeWine may say it's safe to be in East Palestine, but you'll notice he's not spending the night there. One woman who does live there noticed that federal officials, while assuring everybody everything was fine, were wearing hazmat suits.     So, the people who live there obviously want some answers., says the guy in the hazmat suit. Residents of  together gathered for a town hall. The mayor has just told residents that he has not heard from anyone in the White House, didn't until yesterday, when it started to become a political liability for them. The mayor also said he has no idea where Pete Buttigieg is tonight.  "	calls officials handling toxic chemical spill Ohio East Palestine Ohio sits directly border Pennsylvania feet away anything

6	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mayor-pete-completely-incompetent	2023-02-14 22:51:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Mayor Pete is completely incompetent | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out the Biden administration's response to the Ohio chemical catastrophe following the train derailment on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'East Palestine, Ohio is not a huge place. It's a town of about 5,000 people not far from Pittsburgh. For many years, East Palestine was known as the place that produced dishes and cups and pitchers for America's hotels. The enormous ceramics works there employed much of the town. That's all gone now. And predictably, East Palestine is a lot poorer for it. The median household income in the town is now less than $45,000. East Palestine is overwhelmingly White and it's politically conservative. More than 70% of the voters in the surrounding counties supported Donald Trump in the last election.That shouldn't be relevant, but as you're about to hear, it very much is. Eleven days ago, 150-car train derailed in East Palestine, and when it did, it spewed poisonous chemicals onto the ground and into the surface waters. After the crash, the Ohio state EPA found evidence of butyl acrylate in the Ohio River as well as in the creeks and streams that feed it. Now, this was a concern for more than simply East Palestine, given that the Ohio River supplies drinking water to about a tenth of the entire US population. So this train derailment was an environmental disaster, not an ""environmental disaster"" like climate change is, but an actual environmental disaster, a disaster that's hurting actual people.And then it got worse. Several days after the derailment, officials decided it was a good idea to set fire to the spilled chemicals. And the result of that decision was a giant toxic mushroom cloud over the entire region. So given the evident crisis in East Palestine, how did the federal government and the Biden administration respond? Well, under Pete Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation, which responds to train derailments, took decisive action. Pete Buttigieg announced something called Transit Equity Day. That's yet another day that we celebrate race-based federal funding, that, despite the trail train derailment, does not apply to East Palestine because the people who live there are the wrong color. So instead, Buttigieg's DOT announced an $80 million project to improve the roads in Philadelphia and $24 million for the roads in Detroit, both of which vote Democrat.And then Mayor Pete talked about perhaps the most pressing problem in this country, which is that we have too many White construction workers. Mayor Pete said not a single word about . And that's not because everything was under control there. As the DOT was busy tweeting about Black History Month and transit equity, the governor of Ohio announced that that controlled burn of chemicals from the derailment could potentially kill thousands. And that shouldn't surprise you because vinyl chloride, when burned, turns into phosgene. That was the single most deadly poison gas used during World War I. And vinyl chloride was one of the chemicals on that derailed train in East Palestine. Here's the governor of Ohio:Notice the tone and the chuckle at the end. That's Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio, a great defender of Ukraine. And he's just announced that, well, thousands of people in his state could die. But he doesn't seem panicked by it. It's not a ""hair on fire emergency"". It's not like Kiev is in peril. So after that controlled burn of the deadly chemicals, officials told residents within East Palestine that if you live within a two-mile radius of the derailment, you had to shelter in place and keep your windows closed. Residents closer to the mushroom cloud were put up in a hotel. Within days, they were all let back into their home without the Department of Transportation in Washington saying a word. As one hazardous material specialist put it, ""The whole town may be unsafe as a result of this."" Watch. Now, imagine if this had happened in, well, the favored cities of Philadelphia and Detroit. Lots of poor people in those cities. Everyone feels for them. Everyone wants them to be safe. Imagine at the same time this had happened in Washington D.C., in say Georgetown. Well, the National Guard would be called in. There would be no mushroom cloud of toxic chemicals on the horizon. We can promise you that.And of course, in both cases, if this affected the rich or the favored poor, it would be the lead of every news channel in the world. But it happened to the poor benighted town of East Palestine, Ohio, whose people are forgotten And in the view of the people who lead this country, forgettable. So no big deal. The hazmat specialist in that video, Sil Caggiano explained to local media that it's such vinyl chloride on the train, that's not the only threat. There's also ethylene gas and we're quoting. ""You're looking at five, 10, 15, 20 years down the line until you see potential long-term effects. This stuff seeks low lying areas. It could be in sewers, it could be in nooks, crannies and crevices. Of course, that's how poison gas works. Ask anyone in Verdun. And that would explain the effect that the chemical weapons expert just outlined. it would explain why fish and animals are dying in the area without explanation. Of course, the explanation is very obvious. One resident in East Palestine, says his foxes are sick now. Watch this.Pay attention to the animals always. There's a reason the phrase ""canary in the coal mine"" is a cliche. So after all of this becomes public, that the water and the air in and around East Palestine, maybe in the region, could be contaminated, finally –  –   and the Department of Transportation decided to weigh in: ""Our federal partners at EPA are on-site and monitoring indoor and outdoor air quality."" Air quality? What about water? Oh, water. What does that have to do with climate change? Well, it's the one thing you can't do without. After about two and a half days, you die. But they're not even checking the water. They only checked on the air a week after people were let back into their homes. And according to Mayor Pete, the EPA hasn't even screened 200 homes in close proximity to the burn, the burn that wasn't organic or accidental. It was authorities burning it. So they just don't care, actually. Could that be clearer? While residents of East Palestine were inhaling toxic fumes, Mayor Pete was joking about the Chinese spy balloon his boss allowed to fly across the country. He's a funny guy. Watch this.So you're completely incompetent. Completely. There's never been a cabinet secretary this flamboyantly incompetent and this so obviously uncaring almost to the point of evil, if we're being honest about it. And then a little joke at the head. Oh, that was Mayor Pete yesterday, nearly two weeks after the disaster in Ohio. Now, was this disaster predictable? Well, we're not sure. Netflix made a movie about it last year. A train derails in Ohio and spills toxic chemicals everywhere. Some of the locals in East Palestine were actually extras in that film, but no one saw it coming. It never could have happened, right?Well, it is coming out now, and again, we're not exactly sure why this train derailed. But according to a report in Jalopnik, the train involved in the derailment, Norfolk Southern, lobbied federal regulators for about a decade so they wouldn't have to improve their emergency brakes. The Biden administration, like the previous two administrations, didn't push the issue, and apparently the emergency brakes on this particular train failed during this incident.Now, again, there's a lot of propaganda here. There's unions involved. There are a lot of people who benefit from assigning blame to this disaster. So, we're not going to endorse any theory about why it happened. We're only going to note that , who's in charge of finding out why it happened, doesn't seem interested at all. And like everybody else in New York, Washington and L.A., he's just kind of pretending it didn't happen and telling us little jokes. "	calls Biden administration response Ohio chemical catastrophe

9	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-food-water-energy-infrastructure-degraded	2023-02-13 22:23:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Food, water, energy and infrastructure are being degraded | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to leaders not worrying about the recently downed foreign objects or the water supply on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'All of a sudden, it seems like  out of the sky. If you notice, it's not your imagination. Last Sunday, of course, the Pentagon took down that enormous Chinese spy balloon after it had already surveilled our entire country from the Aleutian Islands to South Carolina.  You thought the trend was over, but no. On Friday, the White House announced that fighter jets had downed an object the size of a car over Alaska. Then on Saturday, an American F-22 shot down another unidentified object over Canada. Then on Sunday, an F-16 took out what the pilot said looked like a flying octagon 20,000 feet over Lake Huron. This apparently was the same object that the Pentagon had dismissed as a radar anomaly the night before as it hovered over Montana.  Montana Congressman Matt Rosendale was not convinced. He said it looked very real to him, and apparently he was right. But what was it? What exactly were all three of these objects? As of yesterday, nobody seemed to know. Listen to the commander of NORAD Air Force General Glen VanHerck pointedly say that the U.S. government has not ruled out the possibility of extraterrestrials.      Could be aliens! So, here you have three unknown objects in three days. If these things are extraterrestrial, what we're seeing is an alien invasion. That means at some point they're probably going to demand to be taken to our leader and what are we going to say then?  . Oh. Pretty embarrassing. Thankfully, it doesn't look like that's going to happen. Privately, the U.S. government does not believe these things came from another planet. Whatever they are, they were floating, carried along by wind currents. That means they're lighter than air and therefore unable to enter our atmosphere without burning up. They must have come from Earth. In other words, they're what we earthlings call balloons. Balloons? Heard the word before? What's weird is that no one in charge is willing to say the B-word out loud. Watch flack John Kirby refused to describe the flying Octagon over Michigan.  Can you tell us anything more about this octagonal object? How big was it?  Well, he's got a necktie on and he's standing in front of a podium, but is this normal? Is this the way things are supposed to work? We shot these things down, but we have no idea what they were. We don't know where they came from or what they were doing here. That's what he's saying. That's what they're all saying and maybe that's true. On the other hand, this is the same administration that sabotaged the Nord Stream pipeline, the single biggest act of industrial terrorism in history, and continues to lie about it. So, the other hand, maybe it's not true, NORAD says the U.S. has just readjusted its radar filter. So, all of a sudden, we're seeing all these objects in the sky we didn't know were there, flying at altitudes that pose an obvious threat to commercial airliners. OK.And you should take that seriously, especially because it's just been reported we cannot confirm this, but you've got to wonder that at least one of these objects was a National Weather Service balloon. Again, unconfirmed, but if that's true, it would mean the Biden administration used fighter jets to shoot down its own balloon and we really are becoming Fetterman nation. Let's hope that's not true. We're starting to suspect it might be. Either way, what we know for certain tonight is that there is chaos in America's domestic airspace. That has never happened before.  It's not a good sign. There's chaos on the ground to a lot of it. Ten, days ago, for example, a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. That's about 50 minutes outside Pittsburgh. Apparently, there was some kind of mechanical failure. We still don't have details on what that failure was. Of course, we don't. We do know about 50 cars derailed. At least 10 of them were carrying thousands of gallons of highly dangerous chemicals, including funnel chloride, which causes cancer. Watch.   We don't want to second guess anybody. We got to assume everybody involved was doing their best under a highly stressful situation, but did you see that mushroom cloud? That was caused on purpose and maybe there's a good reason. Again, no second guessing, but what it means is those clouds of toxic smoke flew up and out and that toxic smoke almost immediately began killing animals. Dead fish washed up on shore. As one hazardous material specialist put it, we basically nuked the town with chemicals. So, then a representative from the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, arrived to restore calm. Yes, an EPA spokesman explained chemicals from the derailed train did enter the local watershed and yes, they did kill fish, but the drinking water supply remains totally safe. The fish are dead, but go ahead and fill your thermos and brew some coffee. Everything is fine.  Now, we don't know if the locals in East Palestine are drinking the water tonight, but we can tell you the Biden administration doesn't seem too concerned about it either way. Donald Trump got over 71% of the vote in the county in the last presidential election. That's not exactly the Democratic Party's core demographic. Fentanyl. Toxic waste spill. Whatever. They're not our voters and by the way, what does a chemical spill have to do with climate change? If you can't use it to sell solar panels, it's not really an environmental disaster. That's the rule in Washington.  So, no one in the Biden administration bothered to issue warnings to communities that might be in the path of those toxic mushroom clouds you saw floating up from the train wreck because no one cared enough to do that. Pete Buttigieg is the official who's supposed to be in charge of our transportation infrastructure. Technically, he's the transportation secretary. At an appearance today, he seemed to have no idea that there was a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. His real concern, he explained, is that we have too many damn White construction workers in this country.    Yeah, that's the problem, Mayor Pete – too many White guys in hardhats. Why didn't we realize this before we built all this infrastructure that's now crumbling? It's actually not funny and future historians will marvel at just how much damage one incompetent narcissist can cause when he's elevated to a serious job like Transportation secretary.  Here's a guy who could not, on a bet, who could not at gunpoint, change his own tire, who oversees our roads, railways and airports, all of which are crumbling from mismanagement and neglect and not just from mismanagement and neglect, but also from actual acts of sabotage. Over the last two years, the FBI has investigated more than 40 cases of rail sabotage in Washington State alone in one state. Now, a lot of those attacks involve so-called shunt devices. Those are wires stretched between tracks that interfere with the train's electrical signals and cause derailments. In one incident just before Christmas in 2020, a shunt caused a train to derail in Custer, Washington. That train spilled 30,000 gallons of crude oil and forced locals to evacuate their homes. Well, that's not the environmental disaster that Joe Biden talks about because, of course, he can't buy solar panels and the Chinese to fix it, but it was, objectively speaking, an act of terrorism. The interesting thing is very often, in fact, in the majority of cases, people who commit acts of terrorism against infrastructure, whoever they are, are never punished and the ones who are caught aren't really punished.   One woman who tried to destroy trains using a shunt got out of jail after only a year. Oh, so no one's paying any attention and no one really seems to care because what does that have to do with environmental racism and climate? Possibly, as a result of that attitude, there are an awful lot of train derailments in this country, many more than you may realize. In the last calendar year, more than a thousand trains went off the tracks in the United States. How's that for a metaphor? Just today, two more trains derailed. One of them was in South Carolina and one was in Texas near Houston. The train near Houston was also carrying hazardous materials, as so many trains are. What's going on here exactly? We're not even going to guess, but we can tell you the chaos is not limited to our rail system. There have also been many recent attacks on our power grid. Very few of those attacks have been widely reported. Last year there were more than 100 attacks of them in the United States, attacks on our power grid.  In North Carolina this winter, for example, nearly 50,000 people lost their power in freezing temperatures when somebody shot up two energy substations and so on. Why is it not a big story? Oh, it's not a story at all.And of course, at the same time, we've also seen a series of bizarre accidents befalling the food industry, threatening our food supply. That would include unexplained fires and plane crashes and processing plants to chicken feed, that seems to stop egg production. Boy, next they'll be coming for the water. Oh, wait, they are. Less than a month into the Biden administration was also a highly sophisticated attack on the water supply outside Tampa.  Oh, an attack on our water supply. That's weird. I didn't read that in the New York Times, but what's interesting. Not to connect the dots or anything, that was not the only attack on our water supply that year. In January 2021, there was a similar effort to poison the water treatment plant that serves the San Francisco Bay area. An unidentified hacker accessed the facility's computers remotely. According to NBC, ""After logging in, the hacker deleted programs that the water plant used to treat drinking water.""  Now, fortunately, in this case, somebody noticed it. The next day the attack was discovered in those programs were reinstalled, so nobody got poisoned, but they kept trying. There were similar hacks of water treatment facilities in California in August of 2021. There was one in Maine in July of 2021. There was one in Pennsylvania in May of 2021; in Nevada, in March; in New Jersey in September of 2020; in Kansas in March of 2019 and so on.     Who is looking after our water supply? Water, that's kind of basic. That's the job of the EPA. But what does protecting the water have to do with passing out cash in the name of remediating environmental racism? Oh, nothing. So, they're not paying attention. In fact, they're not paying attention to such an extent that even The Washington Post, which is a shill for the administration, if there ever was one, pointed out that, ""For more than two decades, the EPA has not been resourced or organized to secure the nation's water and wastewater sector against physical and cyber threats."" Wait a second. So, nobody is paying attention to the most critical infrastructure— not the racist roads but food, water, energy, transportation, infrastructure? Food, water, energy, infrastructure—what does it add up to? Oh, that adds up to a country. You can't have a country without those things and in every single case, whatever the cause is, food, water, energy and infrastructure are being degraded. Who knows why? If you didn't know any better, you think there might be a war going on. Why is no one talking about this? "	reacts leaders worrying recently downed foreign objects water supply sudden seems sky notice

12	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-self-defense-becoming-illegal	2023-02-09 22:19:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Self-defense is becoming illegal | Fox News	WARNING: Graphic footage—Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices his concerns over rising crime on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' It used to be before liberals embraced authoritarianism that they would talk a lot about rights. You couldn’t debate whether those rights or not.But if you're talking about rights, you at some point want to identify the most basic human right of all. What is that? Well, of course, it's the. That's the essential right upon which all other rights depend. If you can't defend yourself, you can't defend your family and your property, you don't have any rights at all. You're a slave by definition. So, you may be wondering in this moment of creeping authoritarianism, how is the right to self-defense doing in our country? We could give some kind of long lecture, but instead, how about some examples? Consider two shootings that took place at gas stations in the past year in the United States. The first shooting occurred around 2 p.m. on October 6 in the state of Missouri. A 23-year-old felon called Ja'Von Taylor, who had a long criminal record of convictions for armed robbery, for example, began threatening a female clerk, apparently because the gas station didn't carry the kind of cigars that he wanted.  That's when an off-duty fireman called Anthony Santi, who was inside, decided to step in. He told Ja'Von Taylor to leave the store. Well, in response to that, Taylor began threatening him and then ran toward his SUV outside. Santi followed him outside because he suspected that Ja'Von Taylor would retrieve a gun from the car and that's exactly what he did. Javon Taylor pulled an illegal handgun with an extended magazine from his SUV.  Santi, not wanting to get shot, put Taylor in a headlock and that's when Ja'Von Taylor handed the gun to his girlfriend and his girlfriend shot the unarmed fireman in the back, killing him. It was an execution. It's not a close call. The footage is online. We're not going to show it to you because it's awful. But if you have any doubt, you can watch it. So, there's no debate about what happened here. And yet the local social justice D.A., Jean Peters Baker, refused to press charges against the person who killed the firefighter. Now, why? Well, there may have been a political component and we know that because online BLM activists immediately celebrated the killing on racial grounds. Ja'Von Taylor is Black, Anthony Santi was White. That was enough for them. They're glad he's dead. Now consider the second gas station shooting. This one happened just before midnight, less than a month ago in Austin, Texas. An armed man with a long criminal record called Marquis Demps walked into a Shell station and became violent. Here's a report from the local Fox station describing what happened next.  Demps, waving a knife at the workers, so Naz grabbed a gun telling him to leave. Inst So, a guy with a criminal record and a knife in his hand starts trashing your store and then runs outside to his car. You see, Naz told police later that he shot Marquis Demps because he feared for his life. He thought the guy was going to get a gun and come back and kill him. And that's a reasonable fear, of course. The Anthony Santi murder demonstrates that it is, But in this case, the D.A., a Soros-funded anti-police political activist called Jose Garza, is pressing charges against the clerk. He wants you to see Naz – a man who's widely respected in his community and who actually contributes to our society, as you just heard – he's trying to send that man to prison for the rest of his life.  So, put these two cases together, consider them in tandem. What's the message? Well, the message is if a violent felon starts terrorizing people in your store, ripping your store apart on which you rely for your livelihood, you can't do anything. If he goes back to his car to get a gun, you have to let it happen. So, get shot or go to jail for the rest of your life. Those are your choices, which of course, are not really choices at all. And these are not isolated cases that we cherry pick to make some polemical point. It's happening everywhere.  We saw it happen to  Jose Alba last summer in New York. He's the the prosecutor sent to Rikers Island on a murder charge because he fought back when a thug and other convicted felon attacked him with his girlfriend in the store. Now, that charge was ultimately dropped after the public flipped out because it was so unfair, but Alba left this country for the Dominican Republic because he saw where things are going. Self-defense, the cornerstone of all freedoms without which you cannot be free, you are owned, self-defense is becoming illegal, in effect, in a lot of places and not just in very liberal places like New York City, even in states where some of the strongest self-defense laws on the books.  Arizona, for example, allows residents to shoot trespassers on their property. So, 73-year-old George Alan Kelly lived right on the border. Now, you may have heard that Joe Biden opened the border to millions and millions of people from other countries whose identities we don't know to just walk in. So, if you live on the border, this has changed your life completely, and it scared you. George Alan Kelly was one of those people, lives on the border. He's seeing this firsthand. Now he is in jail tonight, charged with first degree murder, because he shot an illegal alien who trespassed onto his ranch in Kino Springs. That's less than two miles from the border. This happened January 30, just the other day.  Now, we don't know the details of the altercation between the man in prison and the man he killed. But the man in prison has no record of killing anyone else. He's not a convicted felon. He does not have a violent history. The man he killed was an illegal migrant called Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, and he was deported several times to the United States, but let back in. We're not attacking him, just noting him. That's true. So, George Alan Kelly apparently felt threatened and shot that illegal migrant, but prosecutors did not give him the benefit of the doubt. They instantly charged him with first degree murder. So, here he is, George Alan Kelly, this is the guy who, according to Arizona authorities, is a dangerous risk to public safety, who must spend the rest of his life in prison. Assess: Does he seem dangerous to you?   This is an elderly man who can barely walk, who has never been convicted of a violent crime, and he's being treated like a child by some disembodied voice from some fascist. That's what you just saw. Now, the judge in this case is called Emilio Velasquez. Now, who's Emilio Velasquez? He's a judge. He doesn't even have a law degree. He's not a lawyer and yet he's a judge. He's an elected politician and he is allowing the prosecution of an American citizen who exercised his rights under Arizona law and his most basic human right, which is if someone comes onto your property, and you feel threatened by it, you have a right to defend yourself by force. Period. But Velasquez does not acknowledge that right and so he set the bail for this elderly man whose wife is living alone in their home right near the border at $1,000,000.  So, news of this case obviously traveled past Arizona, and people were justly outraged by what is being done to this man. So, people were trying to raise money to pay that bail on GoFundMe, but GoFundMe wouldn't allow that. This elderly man rotting in jail while wife lives alone on a border that the Democratic Party has kept open, you can't raise money for his bail. They shut down –  GoFundMe shut down the effort to raise bail for this guy. Now, of course, you can raise money for BLM as they burn our country down to make sure Donald Trump is not re-elected, but you're not allowed to raise money for people being held on $1,000,000 bail on first degree murder charges for defending their own property along an open border. True insanity and a danger to all of us. Even in Texas, which in some places is still a free state, self-defense is slowly becoming illegal. A few weeks ago, a thug walked into a taco shop holding what looked to be a gun, scared the hell out of everybody inside and stole their money. He pointed this gun, turned out to be fake, at several customers. How would you feel if you were there in the restaurant and some lunatic with a gun starts shoving the barrel in people's faces and stealing their money? Well, one brave man stood up and eliminated the threat. Here it is.   So, it would be interesting – and we should do this – play that video for the entire country and let's have a national referendum on what ought to happen to the man who shot the armed robber. You're eating with your family in a restaurant, some lunatic in a mask comes in and shoves a gun in your face, what you think is a gun, and steals your money, and somebody stands up and shoots him back. What percentage of Americans think that guys should go to jail? Right around zero, probably, but Houston police, along with the county district attorney, are putting that man in front of a grand jury to send him to prison. They're saying he shot the criminal one too many times. Ok, it's not hard to see why people are making sure they're putting down violent thugs. If they don't, they'll get out of jail and start terrorizing more people. That is happening everywhere. Just happened in Tupelo, Mississippi, in September. Mississippi is the state controlled by Republicans. The politicians in Mississippi started letting felons out on parole, and that would include a man called Chris Copeland, who's 26. He had multiple convictions for burglary and auto theft. Copeland was out on probation, executed a clerk inside a Chevron after robbing him. He made that clerk, a man called Parmvir Singh, sit down and then shot him in the back of the head. This footage is awful, but it's real. Turn away if you don't want to see it. Just executed him. So, politicians can feel like good and virtuous people by giving a second chance to felons. By the way, felons do deserve a second chance. Not everyone in prison deserves to be there, but when you let people out wholesale and they don't keep track of them, just expect the best, you're going to get psychopaths like Chris Copeland into the general population and they're going to execute store clerks who are the last people deserve to be executed. They're working for like eight bucks an hour to sell you lotto tickets.   Meanwhile, people who defend themselves against criminals get the maximum possible sentence. The government gets to defend itself with bodyguards. Politicians have tons of bodyguards you pay for. Congress is so afraid of the people that govern, they built a wall around the Capitol this week, but you can't fight back. And we begin to see this accelerate in 2020 during the BLM riots. So, a BLM mob broke the gate into Mark and Patricia's McCloskey's property in St Louis. They were having dinner. All of a sudden the mob shows up and so in response, they did what you would do if you were awake, you grab your firearms. You don’t shoot anybody. Back off. Those firearms were lawfully owned. They were on their property, as was the mob. Remember that? . Right. A group of highly entitled children of orthodontists showed up on their property to threaten them, and they said, back off. So, they're racist, said The Washington Post.And then, of course, a Soros-backed prosecutor called Kim Gardner, charge them, charge the McCloskeys with crime, not the mob, the McCloskeys for daring to defend themselves. Their . Now, the point of this, of course, is not to make anybody safer. Just the opposite and Saint Louis has not become safer, has become much more dangerous. Under Kim Gardner, the city has experienced its highest murder rate in decades. So, public safety is not the point. The point is disarming you so you can't defend yourself against their plans for you. 	WARNING Graphic footage voices concerns rising crime used liberals embraced authoritarianism rights debate whether

15	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lies-kept-coming-during-bidens-state-union-speech	2023-02-08 22:25:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The lies 'just kept coming' during Biden's State of the Union speech | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to President Biden's State of the Union address on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Did you watch the State of the Union address last night? We do not blame you if you took a pass on that. Tuning in was a grim task. 80-year-old Joe Biden shuffling, stiff legged and bewildered to the podium, a husk held together by Botox and enough amphetamines from the White House doctor to read the slogans written for him by unelected Obama acolytes who actually run the government. This is our President, ladies and gentlemen. It's always pretty hard to believe when you see it. The whole scene is so awful, so degrading to our once proud country, it cannot end soon enough. But the moment was, we will confess at times, pretty amusing. At one point, the eminent TV doctor, Dr. Jill, who really ought to have her own show on Bravo dispensing sassy and empowering medical advice, walked over to Kamala Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff, and , square in the mouth without a mask. Something that never, ever happens at his house. What was that about? There was an unmistakable 1970s-suburban-Connecticut-key-party vibe to it. Kind of a John Cheever story, old school stuff, except they let bystanders film the whole thing. So clearly, these people are exhibitionists too. Naughty.There's a lot going on behind the scenes in the Biden administration, a lot of which we don't want to know more about. But where do these people find the time for high jinks? Dr. Jill, for example, is extremely, extremely busy. Way busier than you are. According to her husband, Dr. Jill is working day and night to drag this country out of its medieval ignorance. And that's not an easy task. Watch.Wait a second. Dr. Jill is teaching, quote, ""full-time."" How many hours a week is full-time? And where is this happening? What school or university or madrassa is she teaching at? What is she teaching? Can we sign up for her class? How come we didn't know any of this until last night? ""Any nation that out-educates us is going to out-compete us,"" says Dr. Jill. And that's a fair point. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Bravo, Dr. Jill, bravo. The question is, how shall we as a nation respond to Dr. Jill's clarion call for action. Obviously, we need to shut down the schools for an entire year because unionized teachers feel like longer vacations, and then get rid of all standardized tests because racism. That's the solution. It turns out that Dr. Jill, who like an awful lot of community college geniuses from Delaware who've received advanced degrees in, quote, ""education,"" she has an awful lot of good ideas. We ought to listen to her more. Unfortunately, we don't often get the chance because she's always teaching. So that really was the highlight of the evening, Dr. Jill making out with the vice president's husband and then Joe Biden bragging about a job she doesn't actually have. Pretty hard not to find that funny.And then there was Biden, himself. Now, the President's mental condition is either scary and depressing, deeply alarming, or absolutely hilarious, depending upon your mood. Last night, for lack of other entertainment options, we decided to find it funny. So take in this steaming pile of word puree and see if you can make sense of it.  We shot down their balloon, so name me a world leader who can decipher what Joe Biden just said. Name me one. See, you can't. Friends, democracy is winning tonight. Now, we have no idea what any of that means, any more than Xi Jinping does. But the trained seals in the crowd loved it. They clapped consistent with their species. Actually, sorry, that is unfair to seals. There's not a seal in the ocean or even at SeaWorld who would wear an ""I love abortion"" pin. That is too low even for marine mammals. They may eat live fish, but they're not ghouls. Congressional Democrats, by contrast, are ghouls.Take a look at this pin, which has replaced the American flag on their lapels. Notice that the ""o"" in abortion is in the shape of a heart. They literally love abortion. Now, let's set aside the politics and ask an honest question. Who loves abortion? Honestly, who loves abortion? Maybe you think abortion should be legal, but do you love abortion? Do you think abortion is a wonderful, affirming act you feel so proud of you brag about it with jewelry? If you feel that way, you should know that you are not defending a medical procedure. You wouldn't say that about an appendectomy. No, you are promoting an ancient religious right called human sacrifice. That's what this is, promoting human sacrifice. Let's stop lying about it. It's very obvious now.And speaking of death cults, Joe Biden made his case last night for the sexual mutilation of children.First, you want to say, ""Whoa, pause, Mr. President. Define every letter in the acronym and what they all mean."" Of course, he couldn't. But he is pointing to an occurring reality in our country. There are hospitals in the United States, hard as it is to believe, that are right now performing mastectomies on little girls in the name of gender ideology. They're castrating children and then giving them drugs that produce sterility and osteoporosis. And they're bragging about it. Now, this has happened with adults for a long time. It's never happened at scale with children and no one's ever bragged about it. But the Democratic Party now is. Not just endorsing it, not just supporting it silently, by calling it an affirmative good. Joe Biden, the guy who showered with his daughter, causing her to develop sexual compulsions as an adult, calls the sexual mutilation of children, ""safety and dignity."" That's dark, really dark.But it got worse, actually. The humor stopped and the darkness descended. Joe Biden proceeded to talk about the recent . Now, you'll remember that he was killed by five police officers, all of whom were Black, as was he. So the takeaway from that episode may be worth knowing about, but it has nothing to do with race, at least not directly. Everyone was the same color. And yet last night, Joe Biden used that sad episode, with Tyre Nichols' family present in the room, to advance the lie. The one you hear so often, that the white middle class is the single greatest threat to America and especially to Black people. Watch this. Now it is fair that they don't worry like that in the Biden family. Both of Biden's surviving children have had run-ins with the police repeatedly. Hunter Biden left a crack pipe and his I.D. in a rental car, but no one ever followed up on it because he was the son of a powerful politician. Maybe Joe Biden should be grateful for that, but it's not a racial issue. But he's saying that it is. The police, African-Americans, are trying to murder you because you're Black. That's unifying the country. Police are responsible for all the violence in Black communities. That's his message. Now, that is not only a lie, provably a lie, because reliable statistics exist. It's a lie that's caused a lot of people, including a lot of Black Americans, to die over the last three years because police in many places have stopped enforcing the law and in others have simply quit. And they're replaced by total mediocrities and crazy, violent people like the cops who beat Tyre Nichols to death in Memphis. How do you think they got that job? Because normal people quit. That's why. Because they didn't want to work in an industry that's under attack unfairly from the President of the United States. And now Joe Biden is repeating that lie and on and on and on. At one point, he claimed January 6 was an ""act of insurrection,"" and that it was an insurrectionist, not a hippie nudist with a BLM sign outside his home, who attacked Paul Pelosi last year. Do you remember that?The insurrectionists. People who were justly upset because they felt that the 2020 election was not level. Which it was not, by the way, which it was not. And we know that for a fact now that we've seen the Twitter Files, which prove that the Big Tech companies took a side in that election and we didn't have a free and fair election, certainly not a free press. But people who were upset about that are now insurrectionists. Nonviolent protesters are insurrectionists, etc., etc., etc.And the lies just kept coming to the point where it was deeply frustrating to watch. At one point, Biden claimed that NATO was fighting against Putin's aggression, even though we now know, thanks to the Israeli Prime Minister, that it was NATO, the United States, in other words, that prevented a truce from being signed between Russia and Ukraine last year. As Joe Biden said that, a lie, Mitch McConnell clapped and smiled wearing his Ukraine flag tie. But maybe the most egregious lie is one that affects every American. Biden claimed that  could not be doing better because he's an economic wizard. Watch this.So those were very specific claims about the economy, a lot of which is easy to measure."	reacts President Biden Union address Good watch Union address last night blame took pass Tuning

So if you're Biden, it would take a lot of brass to stand up on live television and claim the U.S. is better off than it was when you took over. Could you do that? Well, in a little more than an hour, If only it were true. It's not true. This country is more divided, less self-confident, more confused and sadder than it's been in living memory. For the first time in generations, we face the actual risk of a world war. Our problems are fixable, but they are profound, and they require the full attention of wise and serious leaders who love the country and who are willing to think beyond the next election. Instead, unfortunately, we've got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the cast of mediocrities who stand behind them making the actual decisions So if we had to guess, we would guess that Biden is going to use his speech tonight as yet other another opportunity to brag about his victories and blame his failures on others. January 6, Vladimir Putin. We don't expect a single honest word. We hope we're surprised, but we don't expect to be. In the meantime, here's as close to we can get as this statistical analysis of the actual state of the union under Joe Biden.Since his predecessor, Donald Trump, gave his final address to the joint session of the Congress, the cost of food staples in the United States – a pretty good measure – has risen by more than 20%. The price of gasoline has gone up by more than 40 and diesel even higher. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is the mirror image, has dropped by 40%. What's risen is credit card debt. That's now at an all-time high, over $1T cumulatively, it is estimated.And homelessness as well. There are now tens of thousands more Americans living on the streets than there were when Joe Biden became president. He'll ignore that fact tonight, guaranteed. What could he say about it? On the other hand, how could he ignore it? But again, he will. Interest rates, meanwhile, have skyrocketed. The number of new home buyers is lower than it's been in any point in modern history. The number of working age American men who are actually working is now under 68%. Take a look at the graph on your screen. If anything is an emergency, that's an emergency, but it's being ignored.""We'll just import new workers."" And that's why the southern border of the United States is open tonight, as it has been for two years. And because it's open, millions and millions and millions of foreign nationals have streamed across into our country illegally. In many cases, we know nothing about them at all. We can't even imagine how their presence long-term will affect our economy or already strained social services, the ones you paid for your entire life. You think health care is in shambles now? Go ahead and visit an emergency room in five years. Good luck getting treatment.But the real cost to the country isn't social cohesion. This is just too many new people. Doesn't matter whether they're good people or bad people, they're strangers. And there are too many of them. There is no chance we could assimilate all of them. And at this pointy, we have enough problems with our social fabric all on our own. Here's one measure. In March of 2020, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they, quote, ""worried a great deal"" about race. When Joe Biden took office, that number went up to nearly 50%. And, of course, it's all the administration talks about: race. Race is not a solvable condition. It's genetic. It never changes. So if you focus on it, ultimately, you'll make people hate each other. And that's what's happening.That might make you anxious about the future. But of course, our future is education. All of us have heard that since birth in this country. So how are our schools doing under Joe Biden? Well, here's one measure. The national average ACT score in 2022 hitin more than three decades. SAT scores have gone down too. Now, just over 40% of all test takers meet or exceed standards in reading, writing and math. Test results in certain cities are even worse. In Baltimore, for example, at least 23 schools have not a single student, not one student in the whole school, proficient in math. So how is the Biden administration responding to this? Are there alarms going off in the Education Department? No. Schools are just failing to measure the failure. They're getting rid of standardized tests up and down the chain, including Harvard, which just made them optional. The American Bar Association says law students don't even need to take the LSAT anymore because tests are racist. So there's a lot of expressed concern about racial justice and equity. Has that helped people? Well, it's made a few people very rich. The ladies who run Black Lives Matter have a lot of houses. But how are ordinary people doing? Are they better off for all of it? No.Life expectancy in the United States has continued to decline. For all races, Black and White Americans. It's now at its lowest level, life expectancy, in over 25 years. Now, that's not just due to COVID. Those numbers have been declining every year for the past four years. Suicides up roughly 5% that we know of. Overdose deaths up more than 50% since before the pandemic. Alcohol deaths up more than 30%. Now, these aren't so much medical problems as they are famously deaths of despair. And what's jarring is that there doesn't seem to be an option for many Americans. A lot of people in this country don't think they can be saved. Church membership has just dropped below 50% for the first time ever in the history of this country. So it's a sad secular country with decreasing reservoirs of hope and military enlistment is a pretty good measure of how people feel about that. The Pentagon has fallen short of its enlistment targets by 25%. That's more than 15,000 recruits.So what's growing and thriving in this country under Joe Biden? Well, weed dispensaries are. They're popping up everywhere. And the Biden administration is encouraging this. That's the Biden economy. Weed dispensaries backed by private equity. Cannabis sales have exploded in this country, going from $12 billion to more than $30 billion a year. So we're building back better. We're building a lot of weed dispensaries. It's not exactly what we were promised.We'll stop the analysis there, but you get the point. The question is, what will Biden say about all of this? Now, an honest man who cared about the country would identify the problems honestly so we could solve them. Take responsibility for some, shift the blame on others. That's okay. But tell us the truth. If people are dying younger, killing themselves, , if credit card debt is at an all-time high, you can't tell us the State of the Union is strong. And if you can't tell us that, then we can't fix it."	breaks true President Biden Imagine Joe Biden required give Union address Constitution Biden take brass stand television claim U better took

Within a week, it arrived. On January 28, the balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska. From there, it traveled over the Northwest territories of Canada and then it dropped back into the United States over Idaho. By last Wednesday, February 1, it was spotted by civilians in the skies over southern Montana. A man staring out of the window of an office building in Billings saw what he thought was a UFO – was too small to be a moon, he said – and so he began to take pictures, which soon appeared on social media and then almost immediately, the airspace over Billings over the entire town was shut down.  Commercial flights were diverted. F-22 Raptors arrived from a nearby Air Force base, along with refueling tankers and an AWACS surveillance plane. It was a big story. So, it was at this point when the existence of an  over the continental United States became impossible to hide or deny. At that point, officials around Joe Biden finally decided to tell him about it. Now, we don't know Joe Biden's reaction to this news, but we do know his response. Biden did nothing. He did not order the balloon shot down. He did not call for sanctions or punishment of any kind against the Chinese government that sent it. It was not until this weekend when the aircraft had traversed the entire United States, including at least one classified nuclear weapons installation, that an Air Force jet finally pierced it with a sidewinder missile off the coast of South Carolina.  Debris was still fluttering toward the ocean when the administration began telling lies, many of them, about what had happened. That balloon posed no threat to American national security, the Biden administration claimed Why?Because the balloon never transmitted data back to China. Now, how could officials know that? They never explained. Nor did they say whether the Chinese military would send one of its aircraft all the way to the U.S. without a satellite uplink. Apparently, the Chinese just forgot. They're not very good at technology. It was a nonsensical claim, but as far as we know, not a single reporter in Washington pressed the administration to explain that claim, and that's not really surprising. Reporters in Washington no longer dig. They transcribe and what they transcribe next is almost enough to make you cynical about the role of the press in a free society. It turns out, and we learn this from unnamed officials on background, that allowing Chinese military aircraft to surveil your country, including in missile silos, is not the big deal the rest of us thought it was. In fact, it's routine. It happens all the time. Trump did it, too. Quite a bit of it, actually.   At least three Chinese spy balloons flew over this country while Donald Trump was president and despite the anti-China rhetoric, he just let them pass. You didn't know that. Now you do. So, settle down. This is normal. In other words, everything Donald Trump did while president is bad except this letting  fly over the country. That's very good, and we're taking a lesson from him. So, virtually every news organization in this country repeated that claim, including some who should know better and of course, as soon as credulous reporters wrote their dishonest stories, the Democratic Party and the television stations it controls repeated those stories as fact, which was the whole point. Watch.   So, the balloon shut down the airspace over Billings, Montana, including the airport and as it moved east, commercial pilots said they were afraid of it. They're afraid of hitting it. So, it's funny to see the transportation secretary who's in charge of all of this, tell us to pose no threat, no threat to transportation. But the best is the dismissal of anyone who has concerns. It's those Republicans, again, with their moonshine in their shotguns, their extra chromosomes, thinking it's OK to shoot down Chinese spy balloons when every sophisticated person knows, Donald Trump himself knew, the best way to handle Chinese spy balloons, let them pass again. Just like Trump did. Trump, Trump, he's good all of a sudden.  So, the question is, did Donald Trump let Chinese military aircraft float over the United States unmolested while he was president? Well, someone asked him. He says he didn't. In fact, in the interview yesterday, Trump said he had no idea there were any  over the United States when he was president, and he seemed to mean it.But it wasn't just Trump. Trump's former national security adviser said the same thing. He said he never heard anything about Chinese spy balloons over the country and you would think that he would have heard.   Then the general in charge of NORAD Glen VanHerck had the very same reaction. ""It's my responsibility to detect threats to North America. I will tell you that we did not detect those threats."" So, somehow NORAD, the most sophisticated supposedly monitoring system in the world, missed those Chinese spy balloons—two or three of them—and by the way, so did the director of national intelligence, the man whose job it is to know America's secrets. He said he'd never heard of Chinese spy balloons over the country during the Trump administration. Here's former DNI John Ratcliffe. ""It didn't happen,"" said a former director of national intelligence. You can see why he thinks that. So again, according to media accounts, at least one of these three Trump-era Chinese spy balloons floated all the way to Texas in the center of the country and yet inside the U.S. government, at the very highest levels, no one seemed to know that it happened. Well, how could that have occurred, really? Well, the Biden administration had an answer. Speaking on background to its shills in the media, unnamed officials explained that these Chinese spy flights were actually never reported to President Trump or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or even to the secretary of defense.  Why weren't they reported? Because they weren't important enough. They were, ""relatively minor territorial incursions."" OK, so a Chinese military aircraft hovering over Texas more than a thousand miles from the Pacific Ocean is a minor territorial incursion? It's what they said. It's pure absurdity. But once again, no reporter in Washington pushed back.  They just repeated the lie and then, without warning, the White House changed its talking point, undermining the first lie. Actually, they explained today, nobody knew the Chinese spy balloons were floating over America during the Trump administration.  Watch the smarter, but more dishonest White House spokesman spin that tale.   They're not going to get to the specifics of the forensics (Oh the forensics!). But the one thing they're really shocked by when they took control of the U.S. government was how soft on China Trump was. They had no idea. He was letting these Chinese spy flights go over. They were shocked, as shocked as anyone would be. That's what they're saying. Of course, once again, they can't say more because it's classified. Wish we could, sorry. So, what is the real story here? Honestly, we don't know. The Pentagon ignored our many questions. Of course, they did, because we're not going to transcribe them. So, once again, the people who owe you the truth are lying to you. So, all tonight we know with certainty is that the Chinese military just flew an aircraft that reportedly contained explosives over the entire length of the United States and got away with it. That seems like a bad precedent. "	calls Biden administration lies handling Chinese spy balloon Saturday 21st January intel services watched maybe slacked white helium balloon enormous payload

24	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-administrations-stance-chinese-spy-balloon-scary	2023-02-03 21:59:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Biden administration's stance on Chinese spy balloon is scary | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson takes on the Biden administration's response to the Chinese spy balloon over the U.S. on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'You often hear people say you can't have a country without borders. You can't have a country if you don't have borders, but that's also true of airspace, which is itself a kind of border. So, maintaining control of the skies over the United States – deciding who comes in and out and on what terms – that's one of the most basic duties of the Pentagon and has been since aviation began.  If you were to fly your Cessna into restricted airspace in parts of this country, the U.S. military would scramble jets and they might shoot you down. So, it's not a small infraction unless, of course, you happen to be the Chinese government, and you're operating in an enormous white dirigible designed to spy on American nuclear installations. In that case, you could relax. You've got friends at the White House. Absolutely nothing is going to happen to you.  Now, that's not an imaginary scenario. We're not guessing. We know it's true because we're seeing it right now. As you've doubtless heard, an enormous spy balloon, the size of several school buses, has floated over from central China. It's currently, we think, drifting across the continental United States. Yesterday, it passed over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. That's one of only three places in this country that houses minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles. By this afternoon, that  had made it to Kansas City, and there over the skies of that city, a pilot flying a private plane at 47,000 feet came close to hitting the Chinese spy balloon. ""Derelict balloon adrift,"" he said in a notice to other nearby pilots. But it was not a derelict balloon. It was a balloon being controlled by China.  In other words, here we have a foreign military aircraft over our country spying on our critical defense installations and posing a threat to civilian aviation. That seems like a big deal. If you want to know how big of a deal, consider, how would we respond if Putin were doing this, if this were a Russian spy balloon? Well, you'd have the world's shortest news story: ""Russian spy balloon spotted offshore shore, entire U.S. Air Force mobilized, balloon reduced to vapor in seconds."" So, there would not be a lot of debate about what to do about a Russian spy balloon. We'd kill it instantly, as you would any hostile foreign intrusion. But things turn out to be a little different when it's a .   As far as we know, Vladimir Putin has never sent cash to Joe Biden's crackhead son. He probably should have. That would have been a very wise investment in retrospect. The Chinese government, long thinking as always, did send cash to Joe Biden's crack head son and apparently to Joe Biden himself and that paid off. Watch some robot from the Pentagon tell you that you have no right to know anything about this Chinese spy balloon. You think you're a citizen or something? Here it is.     That's what the guy just said. What you didn't hear was a lecture about how the Chinese military is a threat to our democracy and our American way of life. It's not like the Chinese invaded Ukraine. No, just our country. So, no big deal. Stop asking questions. Joe Biden, of course, took that very same position today. Watch: Notice the coms smiles. . They knew they weren't going to answer questions on that and it raises a much bigger question, which is why? What's going on here? What else do they know but refuse to tell us? Well, today, Pentagon sources conceded that the Biden administration has actually been tracking this Chinese spy balloon for months since it left China. That means they watched it float over the Pacific. They watched it pass over the Aleutian Islands and into American airspace and at any time, they could have shot it down over the water, by the way, risking no life on the ground. but they didn't do that. Why didn't they do that? No one will say. Instead, the trusty Pentagon robot offered this explanation. This is one of the dumbest explanations ever articulated from a podium in Washington. Here it is:  You said that this is violating our airspace, so why not take it down?  So, the U.S. military is, in fact, protecting you by letting a  hover over our nuclear facilities. That is, in total, an insultingly ridiculous series of sentences. They make no sense. But the administration's position on the Chinese spy balloon becomes not just ridiculous, but scary when you learn that this is not the first Chinese spy balloon. Other Chinese spy balloons have flown over this country, and the Pentagon didn't shoot them down either.  Now, you probably didn't know that because nobody told the public about it. The existence of those Chinese spy balloons was classified. Apparently, it still is classified. Joe Biden's Pentagon briefers didn't say a word about it today, as you just saw and by the way, it's not just Chinese spy balloons over this country. It's many other countries.Nearly identical Chinese spy balloons have been dispatched by the Chinese military into the airspace of Japan and India and the Philippines and in at least one case, probably all cases, at least one we know of, over a military installation. So, Chinese spy balloons are actually kind of expensive to make and there's a diplomatic risk in deploying them over other people's airspaces. We're seeing that happen now. So, you don't do this on a whim.  You do it for a reason. The question is, what's the reason? We're going to try to get to the bottom of it, if we can. "	takes Biden administration response Chinese spy balloon U often hear without borders borders true airspace border maintaining control skies

If you were, for example, at a red light in pre-invasion Baghdad and Uday Hussein came screaming up behind you, drunk in his Lamborghini, you got the hell out of the way, and you did not complain about it. And you didn't complain about it because Uday's dad ran the place and you did not want to make him mad. You might wind up like the members of his personal soccer team who dared to miss penalty kicks.That's what third world countries are like. All citizens are not equal in countries like that. Power derives from proximity to power, and that means the second most powerful people in a country like that are the children of the president. And very often they don't have jobs and are addicted to something. That's the way it works in places like that. And for a long time, that system seemed very foreign to most Americans. They were used to living in a democracy. They could barely even imagine it. But then, during the last presidential campaign, , somehow, in a house she was staying at in Florida after she got out of rehab. And in that diary, Ashley Biden recounted how her father had taken showers with her when she was young, and she attributed her later sexual compulsions to that experience with her father. So by any standard, that seemed like clear evidence of abuse and yet no law enforcement agency, so far as we know, ever asked Joe Biden about it. Instead, once Joe Biden became president, his FBI raided the home of journalist James O'Keefe and seized the evidence. Ashley Biden's diary was taken by force and has never been seen again.So the message was unmistakable. When Uday Hussein blows by in his Lamborghini, get the hell out of the way, peasant. Princelings have power, you do not. By the way, Hunter Biden's whole life has been a monument to that message. Despite a decades-long drug problem and no record of legitimate achievement of any kind, Hunter Biden has managed to accumulate the highest possible academic credentials: Georgetown and Yale Law. Don't try that at home. As well as what appears to be millions and millions and millions of dollars.How did he do that? You couldn't do it. But then you're not Joe Biden's son and that's how he did it. He cut business deals with the corrupt countries that his father was conducting diplomacy in as vice president of the United States. And then, we know from evidence, that he apparently planned to kick back some of that money to his father as part of the deal – 10% for ""The Big Guy."" Now, that's completely illegal. And yet neither Hunter Biden nor his father, Joe Biden, have ever been indicted for doing that. Instead, and here's the best part: the real criminals, we learned yesterday, are the people who dared to talk about it.Yesterday, Hunter Biden's legal team released a letter demanding that Joe Biden's friends imprison anyone who criticizes Joe Biden's son. So these letters call in the Department of Justice, which Joe Biden controls, and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings from Joe Biden's state to file criminal charges against Republicans who dare to possess and share the contents of his son's now famous laptop. And that list would include, among others, John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of the Mac repair shop where Hunter Biden abandoned said laptop. According to Hunter Biden's high-paid lawyers, John Paul Mac Isaac should be in prison for doing this. Quote, ""Mr. Mac Isaac chose to work with Donald Trump's personal lawyer to weaponize Mr. Biden's personal computer data against his father, Joseph R. Biden."" In other words, John Paul Mac Isaac didn't want Joe Biden to become president, and apparently that's now a federal crime. But wait a second. Back up a second. Does that mean we can now say with certainty the laptop is real? If we can say that, that means that Adam Schiff, who's now running for Senate in California, had better issue a statement, pronto, correcting his previous categorical claims about the laptop. Here was Adam Schiff in October of 2020 when he chaired the House Intelligence Committee:""We know this comes from the Kremlin,"" Adam Schiff said. And of course, Adam Schiff would know since he, unlike you, had access to top secret information. You weren't allowed to see it. He did see it and on the basis of that knowledge, told you it was from the Kremlin. And it's exactly what dozens of former intel officials told you. They saw the evidence and this was from Russia. So now it looks like they were all lying. According to Hunter Biden's lawyers, quote, ""Mr. Mac Isaac unlawfully shared Mr. Biden's property with third parties."" His property? He owned it. It was his. Yes, the laptop, according to Hunter Biden's lawyers, belonged to Hunter. It did not come from the Kremlin. That's settled.Except wait. No, it's not settled because today, we got yet another statement from  and they seem to revise the first statement. Here's today's statement and we're quoting: ""These letters do not confirm Mac Isaac's or others' versions of a so-called laptop. They addressed their conduct of seeking, manipulating and disseminating what they allege to be Mr. Biden's personal data wherever they claim to have gotten it."" So, in other words, we believe the government should send these people to jail for possessing stolen property that belonged to Hunter Biden. But that so-called property may not actually exist and may not even belong to Hunter Biden. That's their argument.It's a novel legal theory, actually. In fact, it's so novel, it's totally incoherent. It's like prosecuting somebody for stealing your imaginary car. But even if we can agree that the laptop is real and not a deep fake produced by some diabolical Russian AI program, and again, neither Hunter Biden or his lawyers have conceded that yet, maybe they will tomorrow. But even if we could all agree on that, there is another more fundamental problem. And it's this: Hunter Biden signed an agreement acknowledging that if he left his device in John Paul Mac Isaac's repair shop in Delaware for more than 90 days, if he didn't pick it up, he would forfeit ownership of it. He wrote that. No one disputes that he did.And then Hunter Biden violated the contract that he signed, and he violated it because he was a crackhead who was having an affair with his sister-in-law, at least three of his employees, and countless strippers and hookers, while at the same time trying to execute illicit business deals with the Chinese. So he just didn't have time to return for his laptops. That makes sense. He was very busy. John Paul Mac Isaac, meanwhile, being the small business owner, called Hunter Biden again and again and tried to give the laptop back. But Hunter Biden was so busy, he ignored John Paul Mac Isaac. Watch. Kept calling him, kept calling him. He was smoking too much crack with too many hookers. He didn't call me back. That was John Paul Mac Isaac's explanation. So it's kind of hard to blame John Paul Mac Isaac for this. He tried his best to return the laptop. And yet they are blaming him. In fact, Hunter Biden is demanding that Delaware Attorney General, Kathy Jennings, put that guy, John Paul Mac Isaac, in jail for what he did. On what grounds? Hunter Biden is. If he smokes too much crack to follow the terms of the contract he signed, that's not his problem. It's yours.Now, in a normal country, a normal prosecutor would laugh at an argument like that. But Hunter Biden is betting that Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings will take that argument very seriously, and he has reason to believe that she will. Because Kathy Jennings is not just the attorney general. She is a long-time party hack ideologue who can be counted on to faithfully do the bidding of Democratic leaders and donors. And even better, even better than that, Kathy Jennings is a longtime friend of the Biden family. In fact, she once worked for Hunter Biden's brother, Beau Biden, and she worships his father, Joe.We're not guessing. Here's a Facebook post from the now attorney general of Delaware, Kathy Jennings, dated April 25, 2019. We're quoting: ""I've known Joe, Jill and the Biden family for most of my life. Joe is one of the kindest, most genuine people I've ever known. Democrats are blessed with many excellent candidates this year, and I am proud of those choices and what they say about our party. I'm choosing Joe because nobody understands more what it means to heal. And right now, that's what America needs."" Well, right now, the Biden family needs something very different. And Kathy Jennings may be willing to provide it. Again, this is the person that Hunter Biden's lawyers are calling on to send John Paul Mac Isaac to jail. And she very well may send him there.Doesn't seem like a fair fight, really. So here you have John Paul Mac Isaac, a small business owner who lives in a small, corrupt state controlled by the Biden family. He's the peasant in this scenario. And then you have Hunter Biden. He's the princeling. So with no obvious means of support, Hunter Biden has been living in a $20,000 a month spread in Malibu and can somehow - can someone tell us how - afford a team of the most expensive attorneys in the United States of America. How is he doing that? We don't know. We can say one of these guys has a strong advantage in this battle and it's not the little guy."	weighs developments Hunter Biden laptop scandal non democracy dangerous displease ne er children

Have you ever noticed that there's not a single person in the entire overstaffed Biden administration whose job it is to announce good news? Not one. There's the now-familiar Office of Attacking the Middle Class. They're usually quite busy. There's the Department of New and Counterproductive Wars. Those people never sleep. And of course, there's the all powerful Directorate of Hysteria, which makes sure that every living American is terrified of something or other from breakfast till bed. But there is no good news office. That's something the Biden people never considered.So yesterday, the administration seemed a little awkward, maybe even sheepish, when it announced the best news of all, which is that the COVID era has finally passed. For three years, the U.S. has lived under a permanent government-designated COVID emergency. At this point, looking backward, no one can agree on what the point of it was. Certainly nobody got any healthier, that's for sure. In any case, it's ending for good or bad. Technically, the emergency will This will allow the Biden administration to shovel a few more cargo planes full of tax dollars to its donors in the so-called health care industry. But that's it. Those are the last gasps of the Rona scare. We're done.And that means, above all, that we can finally get to the second and much more satisfying part of the program where we finally hold the people accountable who did what they just did to us. And first on that list would be Joe Biden. At this point, Biden has the functional IQ of office furniture, but his instinctive viciousness remains intact. So Biden, the second he got into office, wasted no time at all in blaming Americans for a virus that China created. And then in using the pandemic to pit neighbors against one another. It was the cruelest and most divisive thing any president has ever done to his own country. If you've forgotten what it looked like, here you go.Our patience is wearing thin, Americans. If you want to take an untested experimental mRNA shot from a company that has bought immunity from Congress against future lawsuits, you are a selfish Neanderthal. Worse, you're a killer. You're literally – literally – killing your own neighbors. The only good news is you will soon die yourself because you deserve it. That's what Joe Biden said. The president said that to his own people. And it was, of course, a lie. Leaving aside its potentially terrifying side effects, the shot did not work as advertised. Sorry, it just didn't. It did not prevent people from dying. It did not even prevent them from transmitting or getting COVID themselves. And that's why vaccinated people still wear masks. Everyone knows this, but Joe Biden has never admitted any of it. Nor has the federal government rehired the thousands of good people, really the best people, the Navy SEALs, the nurses, the EMTs, the firemen, the airline pilots, the people who were fired from their jobs for making what turned out to be a pretty solid medical decision. By the way, no one's ever explained why it was immoral somehow to treat COVID before patients wound up on respirators. Why? What was so bad about ivermectin and monoclonal antibody therapy? We still don't know.The administration still won't tell us where the virus came from, though obviously they know the answer. But now is the time to find out. We need a truth and reconciliation commission to get to the bottom of what we just lived through. And let's hope we get one very soon.But in the meantime, this being Washington, the end of COVID, the end of the emergency, poses a much more immediate political problem for the people in charge. The Democratic Party can't govern the country without emergencies. If the public is ever allowed to calm down long enough to think clearly, uncomfortable questions might emerge. Wait a second. If my kid can't get into a good college or work in a big company because he's white, how is this systemic racism thing real? And if it is real, why can't I just change my race like all those people on TV are always changing their sex just by wishing it so? What's the answer? Can you imagine if people started asking questions like that? That would be bad. It would be a disaster.So clearly, the Democratic Party needs a new emergency, at least until we start sending ground troops to Ukraine and the population becomes suitably hysterical again. So because they need an emergency, they found one. And the new emergency turns out to be the old emergency, which is White racism. Now, unfortunately for the Democratic Party, white racism is one commodity, like cedar boards, that's getting harder to find. Very few unarmed Black men are killed by white cops these days. Where's George Floyd when you need him? So instead, in a pinch, they've settled for an unarmed Black man killed by Black cops, which they've informed us nevertheless, despite all appearances, is still the product of White racism.And Barack Obama enthusiastically agrees. This is Barack Obama's lane. He was elected President twice on this kind of stuff, so he immediately jumped into the middle of the  to remind us that white middle class Republicans did this. Blood is on their hands. Selma, Dr. King, Rodney King, Trayvon Martin. They're all the fruit of white supremacy. It's true. And as Obama explained on Twitter, you can learn a lot more about how it's true on his website.Okay. So we decided to go there. We went to the Obama Foundation website today, and there we found an entire section on how we have to continue to defund the police. Yes, people are still saying it.""Cities like Los Angeles, Baltimore and Philadelphia have reduced their budgets for their police departments,"" the Obama Foundation explained without laughing. ""These cuts made funding more available for other elements of public safety, like affordable housing."" Right, because affordable housing is public safety. Unless that affordable housing is in Chicago or Baltimore, in which case you're likely to be killed. But whatever.The point is, take three steps back. Barack Obama, the former president, is weighing in directly on America's latest fake hate crime. And you have to wonder why. He's not doing it for himself. Obama is retired at this point. He's living on Martha's Vineyard with all the other rich white people. He's doing it for his wife. His wife who's never had a real job and apparently is feeling kind of restless, approaching 60. And that's why you may have noticed that six years after leaving Washington, Michelle Obama is back in the news. She's got a new book and a media tour and even a federally funded hiking trail named for herself in Atlanta.Why has she emerged in this way? Well, there might be a reason. In fact, if you didn't know any better, if you were visiting this country from a foreign land trying to figure out what's going on in the U.S., you might mistake what Michelle Obama is doing right now for the beginnings of a presidential campaign. So first, you have a manufactured white racism panic. That's a clue.  But the clincher is menopause. Unlike every other woman over 50 and all human history, Michelle Obama, we're sad to tell you, has menopause. It's not clear where she got it. Maybe there was an outbreak in Edgartown. But it's bad. At one point, Michelle Obama gained up to six pounds. You don't know how much she suffered. Let's put it this way. Bataan Death March survivors, she laughs at you. You can't fathom her pain. Watch her talk about it on TV.You have this slow creep. And no, she's not talking about Joe Biden here, who is technically one of the slowest creeps in America. She's talking about her own thighs. Now, why is Michelle Obama telling you about her menopausal thighs on a TV show? Possibly because she's a crazed narcissist who thinks her own thighs are interesting to you. And that's, of course, true.But there may be other reasons. Consider that today's Washington Post expressed deep dissatisfaction with Joe Biden's current heir, . Now, Harris is a woman who cannot even consistently pronounce her own first name, and she might not be, as the Post suggests, up for the job of leading this country. And we're quoting, ""Some Democrats are worried about Harris's political prospects,"" the paper says. They're worried she may not have the, quote, ""political skills to win a national race."" Whoa, wait a second, pale colonizer. Kamala Harris doesn't have skills? Isn't that racist? Well, as The Post reports, yes, it is. Quote, ""Some party members fear that Americans are simply not willing to elect a woman of color as President, especially given the racism and sexism they see emerging in recent years."" Yeah, because there's more now.So here's the problem for the Democratic Party. The current vice president is totally incompetent and universally loathed by everyone, including her staff and possibly her husband, who literally kissed her with a mask on. We're not judging, but you can see it for yourself. So you don't want her. But you can't just ditch or for a white dude. Sorry, that's not equity. So where do you go from here? Ooh, good question. And it turns out it's a question that Michelle Obama seems to have been thinking about recently. Here she is this fall, considering the matter of whether her elderly old servant - sorry, her dear, dear friend - Joe Biden, should grace this country with yet another term as president. Watch.He's doing – a pause here – ""the best he can."" As to whether he runs again, Michelle Obama is going to have to – much longer pause here, accompanied by a wearied sigh – she's going to have to ""have to see"" about Joe Biden. ""Have to see."" The question is, will the rest of us have to see a whole lot more of Michelle Obama in the next two years?"	weighs impact COVID policy racial division Michelle Obama possibly groomed

""It's going to be real,"" he said. Now, Biden said this in a very odd way. There was no hint or panic, emotions you'd expect from a leader predicting the deaths of human beings from starvation. None of that. Instead, there was pure, nonchalant casualness. Biden could have been describing the weather or a trip to the dry cleaners. ""It's going to be real."" Then Biden continued, recounting a conversation he had with European allies. He told us all about it. When he met with the group, Biden said, they spoke about ""how we could increase and disseminate more rapidly food shortages."" That's what Joe Biden said verbatim. It's on tape. So here you have the president of the United States pledging to increase food shortages at a press conference. That seemed like a newsworthy event, but not a single news organization in this country seemed to notice it happened. Nor did the White House correct it. But others were watching. So within days, that clip wound up on social media and Facebook flagged it immediately as ""false news."" Now, strictly speaking, that's untrue. There's nothing false about the video. It was entirely real. No one can test that. But apparently, Facebook users were supposed to understand that Joe Biden is senile and therefore he's not accountable for his own words. Taking Joe Biden literally qualifies as ""misinformation."" Now, we'll leave that whole episode for you to assess. We can't know what Joe Biden was thinking, if anything, when he uttered those words in Brussels. We can only tell you what happened afterward.Strange disasters began to beset food processors all over the United States. In April, the next month, the headquarters of one of this country's largest organic food distributors was destroyed in a fire. Cause unknown. The next month, in a single week, actually, two separate private plane crashes took out two separate food processing centers. One plane hit a General Mills plant in Georgia. The other plane hit a food plant in Idaho. By the way, back in February, a boiler explosion obliterated a potato processing plant in Oregon and so on. So even people who aren't given to connecting the dots, who don't think of themselves as conspiracy nuts, begin to wonder, ""Is there something here?"" But no one could tell. The Biden administration had no answers and no way to get to the answers because they had no data. And that's interesting because the Biden administration tracks a lot of things, the things that it cares about, the race and ethnicity and sex life, for example, of every person in America. Do we even have trans Pacific Islanders playing woodwinds in major symphonies? How about gay Southeast Asians in long haul trucking? These are the questions that concern the bean counters in the Biden administration. And yet at the same time, that same administration keeps no real records of what the infrastructure of our food supply. Apparently, that has never occurred to them. So, honestly, we can't really know one way or the other, because we don't have a baseline, whether something strange is going on with food suppliers.But some days you do wonder. On Saturday, an enormous commercial egg farm in central Connecticut burned to the ground for no obvious reason. Huge fire. At least 20 fire departments responded, fought the blaze for over 8 hours. More than 100,000 chickens died. Now, that's a sad story. But what's interesting is that most media companies did not consider it a story at all. Weird, considering egg prices have become an actual problem for most Americans. Egg prices are up more than 100% in many places. And yet at that exact moment, when eggs are a concern, 100,000 chickens die in a freak fire. And The New York Times, which is right next door in a neighboring state, does not even cover the fire. What is that? Don't worry. ""Things like this have nothing to do with egg prices,: say the media. It's just avian flu. Watch. So if you ask the Agriculture Department, for example, or anyone in the Biden administration, to the extent they're paying attention, which is not much, they'll tell you that egg prices are high because . And that's a completely natural virus, just like COVID. The prices have nothing to do with chicken farms burning down. Again, not that anyone in the government tracks that kind of thing. Why would they? Because nothing like that could ever happen. Settle down, QAnon. And a lot of people, particularly the national news media, people who could not identify a chicken if it didn't come with dipping sauce, are satisfied with that explanation.But we noticed that some farmers who deal with chickens every day are not convinced. Some of them, some chicken farmers, have noticed something odd. Their chickens aren't laying eggs or as many eggs. And these chickens don't appear sick with avian flu. They're not dying. They're still alive. They're just not producing eggs. Now healthy hens lay eggs on a regular basis, every 24 to 26 hours. But suddenly, chicken owners all over the country – not all of them, but a lot of them – are reporting they're not getting any eggs or as many. So what's causing that? Clearly, something is causing that. Some have concluded their chicken feed may be responsible. Watch.So why'd we just put that clip on TV? Because that chicken owner speaks for all ? Because she's the world's greatest expert on avian questions? Probably not. But because the people who should be keeping track of what's going on are clearly not keeping track of what's going on because they just don't care. And so instead of going to the usual sources at the AG Department or calling the White House press office, we decided to listen to people who actually have chickens. And that one, for example, the lady you just saw, says she switched her chicken feed and it solved the problem. Her chickens began laying eggs once again immediately. Now, the specific brand of feed referenced in that video is called ""Producer's Pride."" It's made by Purina. Most chicken feed brands are made by Purina. Purina also makes Producer's Pride – that's the cattle feed recently subject to a recall after regulators linked the product to a series of unexplained cattle deaths. It was removed from shelves because there was a good chance you shouldn't be feeding it to livestock. Could that be happening again? Now, we don't know. But we should tell you because again, no one else seems to be keeping track of this, that it's not just Producer's Pride that some chicken owners are worried about. Some have concerns about several other chicken feed brands made by Purina.So we reached out to the company today because, again, we're agnostic on this, but we figured we would do a little poking. And they said they've looked into it too, and their feed is not the problem. And that may absolutely be true. We don't know. What we did notice, though, was that that explanation was more than enough for most media companies, trained as they are to accept corporate press releases as the final word on any given topic. Well, they said it's not a problem. So it's not a problem. We don't think that's the last word. Again, we can't tell you for certain either way. But we do know and here's really the point, that America's food supply is one of those topics is worth being a little paranoid about. This is not a matter of how many trans Pacific Islander oboists we've got. This is a matter of national survival – of food. The question on which empires rise and fall. And in this specific case, eggs, poultry and chicken, avian products, are major, major sources of protein in the diets of most Americans. And you need protein to live. If you don't have enough, you get protein deficiency, and that can stunt growth in children. So a question like this, whatever its cause, could easily flower into an actual public health crisis. And of course, it's also potentially a national security problem. There are so few eggs right now at such high cost that smugglers are trafficking eggs across our border. Watch this.So are we being a little paranoid about the American food supply? Yes, we are. And we're proud of it. And our leaders should be even more paranoid, always, about our food supply. Food, energy, water. Those are the three things that matter. The rest of it is noise. And, of course, as always, they're ignoring what really matters."	voices concerns egg shortage Last spring March press conference Brussels Joe Biden explained sanctions imposing Russia morally

Parts of it are brutal. It seems like an abuse of power. You can't kick a man when he's on the deck, on the ground, handcuffed. Decent people oppose it. Virtually all Americans oppose that. We should also remember that we don't know all the facts here. We've seen a lot of videos over the years that have been put to uses that had nothing to do with the topic of the video itself. So, we should suspend some level of judgment, but that video is awful in a lot of ways, but here's what it's not.  It's not an example of racism, systemic or otherwise. The man on the ground who was killed or died in any case was Black, but so was every police officer you just saw hitting him. So, by the way, is the police chief of Memphis. So is most of its city government. So also, is the overwhelming majority of the city of Memphis itself. So, whatever you think of them, White people did not play any role in this particular tragedy. Whatever the story may be about, it's not about racial bias. Any honest person could see that immediately, but you would never know it from watching the so-called news coverage of this tape today. The only person whose race most media outlets identified was the victim.  they said.  Moments ago on MSNBC, they just described what you just saw as White supremacy. Really? How? CNN's Van Jones did acknowledge that the police who hit  were Black, but, ""they might still have been driven by racism."" Van Jones didn't take the time to explain how. It was a lie of course. They're all lying and Joe Biden himself, the president of the United States, swiftly reinforced that lie, referring to an event in which every single participant and their supervisors was the same color, Biden lectured the United States that, ""fatal encounters with law enforcement have disparately impacted Black and Brown people."" The one thing we know, no matter how you feel about the video and most people don't think that's right, but the one thing we know for sure is that there is a highly aggressive propaganda campaign underway tonight designed to manipulate you and using the sad death of a young man in Memphis to do it. That propaganda campaign, like all propaganda campaigns, is by definition dishonest, but it's more than that. It's worse than that. This is yet another attempt by our leaders of our country to inflame racial hatred in the United States. Why would anyone ever do that? The consequences of doing that ripple through the generations. They don't go away quickly, but they're doing it anyway. Why? We can't say for certain, but we can't help but notice that the last time we had race riots in this country, a president, an incumbent president, lost reelection. There was a point.  So, Joe Biden, if he weren't senile, might be concerned by this, but whatever the intent of lying about what you just saw might be, we know that it's evil and we are beginning to suspect that the violence expected in Memphis tonight is not organic. It's not just outraged people taking to the streets. Why are we guessing that? Because similar violence is also expected tonight in cities across the country.  As we speak, Antifa is coordinating riots on both coasts and in between. That would include Seattle and Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles, California, as well as Atlanta, Georgia, New York City, suburban Washington, D.C., etc., etc.. Barricades are going up right now in Times Square. The NYPD is worried about attacks on police and potentially public transportation. ""Our rage is stronger than their power,"" declared the Antifa chapter in Frederick, Maryland.  Of course, by morning we'll know if that's true, but we already know there's a lie embedded in the claim: outrage. . No. That's not what's happening. Antifa is not a bunch of hooligans. These are not idle kids who just appear out of nowhere because they're so mad about what they saw on cable news or read on Twitter.   Antifa Is a political instrument whose actions always are intended to effect a political outcome. Period. Antifa does not appear by accident. Antifa appears with a purpose to effect a political outcome every single time and if there's one criticism of the rest of us watching this at home, it's that we often miss that because every channel is telling us something terrible happened, here's a video of it and sometimes the video is terrible and then they imply that because of this video, the emotions of the people watching just erupt into rage and violence, but that's not what's happening.  Antifa is being organized by who? We don't know. Why don't we know? To do what? We can't say right now, but we know for certain that in cities across the country right now Antifa is mobilizing to . This is a political militia. So, the question is: who's benefiting from it? Those are the people you ought to be asking questions of, and we're going to have time to do that, but right now, we are on the cusp of what many in law enforcement expect to be a long and violent evening. "	WARNING Graphic footage analyzes Tyre Nichols death used justify riots video hard watch Parts brutal seems abuse power kick man deck ground handcuffed Decent oppose Virtually Americans

39	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-you-really-want-understand-how-powerful-big-pharma-is-consider-this	2023-01-26 23:44:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: If you really want to understand how powerful Big Pharma is, consider this | Fox News	"WARNING: Graphic footage—Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out Pfizer's alleged manipulation during the COVID-19 pandemic on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'How powerful exactly are the  in this country? Well, that's a big question. There are a lot of ways to measure it, but here are a few ways you can measure it. In this country, Big Pharma can advertise its drugs directly to consumers and that's a little strange if you think about it, since consumers don't prescribe drugs, doctors do. So, why are the drugs being advertised directly to consumers?  That's allowed in only one other country on the planet, but it's allowed here. So, it may not surprise you that in this country, drug companies spend more on lobbying the Congress than any other industry, a lot more than any other industry and they don't do it by accident. They do it because it pays off. In a deal like this, a pretty remarkable deal, the drug companies have worked out with politicians. So, the government uses your tax dollars to buy billions worth of their products and then in some cases forces you to use those products. Sometimes those products work, sometimes they don't work. In some cases, those products can injure you, but no matter what happens, there's nothing you can do about it because politicians have given these companies complete immunity. If their products hurt or kill you, you can't sue them. You're not even really allowed to complain about it. That's an incredible deal. Imagine if your company had struck a deal like that with Congress. You'd probably be a lot richer than you are.  So that's power, but it pales in comparison to what we're seeing right now. If you really want to understand how powerful Big Pharma is, consider the news that did not break today. The pro-transparency news organization Project Veritas just released an undercover video of a Pfizer executive bragging on camera about how his company conducts a kind of Frankenstein science, manipulating COVID viruses for profit, imperiling potentially the entire world, doing it in secret, possibly in violation of federal law, bragging about this. So, no matter what your politics are, doesn’t matter who you voted for, that's a huge story and you would think every reporter in this country would be itching to follow up on it, calling Pfizer, telling the public about it, but no, that's not happening.    In the 24 hours since Project Veritas posted this footage, it has been viewed more than 12 million times on Twitter. So, the public is very interested. Why wouldn't they be? But the media are not. No other media outlet has covered the story at all. We checked. MSNBC and CNN, which perhaps not coincidentally, take huge amounts of advertising dollars from Pfizer, those two channels have devoted a total of zero seconds to the story. Well, just go online and find out about it. Well, Google, the biggest search engine in the world, which has a monopoly on search in this country, appears to have gone out of its way to make it much more difficult for users to learn anything about the Pfizer executive pictured in the footage and so there is, in other words, on television and in most places online, a near-total media blackout of this story.  How powerful is Big Pharma? That powerful, but we have the footage and we're going to show some of it to you tonight because we think we should. Now, that footage shows a  called Jordon Trishton Walker. He is, according to the documents Project Veritas posted, Pfizer's ""director of research and development for strategic operations and mRNA scientific planning."" It's a big job. Walker is very highly educated and as we said, he's a high-ranking executive at Pfizer. In fact, he's just two reports removed from the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla. His name is Jordon Walker once again. Pfizer's thinking about mutating COVID? We're not going to say that to the public. We're quoting: ""One of the things we're exploring is why don't we just mutate it ourselves so we can preemptively develop new vaccines."" Now, what does that sound like? That sound familiar?   Well, it sounds a lot like the gain-of-function research you read about, the research that was occurring at the Wuhan lab just before COVID broke out of the lab and overturned the world and wrecked the U.S. economy. That was the research that Tony Fauci lied about under oath. As The Intercept has reported: ""Scientists working under a 2014 NIH grant to the EcoHealth Alliance to study bat coronaviruses combine the genetic material from a parent coronavirus known as WIV1 with other viruses."" Seven virologists told The Intercept that the research ""appears to meet NIH's criteria for gain-of-function research."" In other words, it's exactly what it sounds like it is. So that also sounds like what Jordon Walker just described. So, is Pfizer working on that right now? Well, in the clip you just saw, the Pfizer executive is careful to say it's not happening right now, but it is something that Pfizer is secretly considering, not telling the public, but in another undercover video also shot by Project Veritas, Walker suggests that research to mutate viruses is ongoing. They just don't dare call it gain-of-function.     It's not gain-of-function. Oh, no, it's directed evolution. So, if you're wondering how Tony Fauci was allowed to lie under oath and get away with it — the FBI did not raid his house, he was never handcuffed — maybe it's because he used a different term for the same thing. At Pfizer apparently, they're just calling it directed evolution. Problem solved and again, we want to remind you what we just heard and we're quoting the Pfizer executive: ""You're not supposed to do gain-of-function research with the viruses. We'd rather not, but we do these selected structure mutations to make them more potent. There is research ongoing about that."" Oh, wow, to make the virus more potent? You don't think COVID is potent enough? It killed millions of people. Well, Walker went on to say that Pfizer is trying to keep this research hidden from the rest of us. They're still kind of conducting experiments on it. You just don't want to advertise that you're figuring out future mutations. Figuring out? Sounds like they're causing future mutations. Now, it's obvious why this man seems a little uncomfortable with what the company he works for is doing because the plan he describes — and we can't verify it's happening, we can only show you what its executive said — that plan could very easily cause a new pandemic and kill millions of people and, by the way, that's why gain-of-function research was banned until 2017, when Tony Fauci helped restart it and the result was, of course, COVID.  So, if that happened again, anyone could trace it to Pfizer, that would destroy the company, if not the world. So, Walker in this tape made it very clear that Pfizer is worried about a repeat of the COVID lab leak. Wait a second. We're all agreeing there was a COVID lab leak? Yeah, Pfizer's never said that in public, that the COVID strain started in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, where this kind of research was occurring, but apparently everyone just knows that's true.  So, we just went through this three years ago this month and there was a global pandemic as a result, that again, killed millions of people and destroyed entire countries. It really hurt ours. So, why would you even think about doing something like that on purpose once again? Why would you conduct this kind of research when everybody knows the consequences? Well, again, we can't say for sure. We can only tell you what Jordon Walker said and of course, the point is to make money.   Now, a couple of things to notice about that exchange. One, Walker has thought this through. This is not just off the top of his head. He's not stupid and he's clearly thought through the potential consequences of this research, but he also is honest enough to admit that it could be a cash cow and then he says, and he laughs as he says it, COVID has been a cash cow for us. So, imagine two pharma executives meeting in the bar and want to say, ""How can we get kids to smoke more cigarettes because, you know, cancer is a cash cow for us?""  People would recoil in horror and by the way, regulators would be on this. Where are the regulators? You can't just come up with a drug, claim it works, get the government to enforce people's requirement to take it. You have to go through regulators. Where are they? Why aren't they regulating a company like Pfizer? Could it be that regulatory capture is real? We don't have to guess anymore because Jordon Walker explains it for us.     :  So, that was the end of it. James O'Keefe of Project Veritas shows up and informs Walker he's been recorded and he's clearly upset and, of course, you can understand why. He's shocked. He didn't know anyone was filming. Someone was, but what's so interesting is his first excuse is ""I was lying"" when in fact, he has explained in a very sophisticated and very believable way how Washington works. We just promise to hire the regulators and then they don't really regulate us.   What you see happening in the defense industry with generals from the Pentagon happens in pharma, too. The regulators hope to get rich working here, and that's true, and no executive at a pharma company has ever been filmed saying that on camera before. That's not a lie. That's the truest thing ever spoken in Washington, D.C., and then the situation begins to degrade.  So, Walker, who is supposed to be a highly credentialed man of science, a clear-thinking scientist, completely loses control of himself. He becomes hysterical and violent. At one point, he calls the police to complain there are too many White people in his presence and he feels unsafe and then, of course, he becomes violent again. ""Stop hitting me,"" he says as he punches you in the face. It's a remarkable scene. Here's part of it. :      :  Wow. Well, that didn't go well. That man it doesn't seem like much of a scientist. Anyone kind of feel for him? On the other hand, what was that? But more than anything, you've got questions. What was that? This guy's a pretty high-level Pfizer executive confirming a lot of things you already suspected and telling you things you had no idea were going on.   So, of course, you'd want to know, what? Was that real and what does Pfizer have to say about it? Well, no one else is calling Pfizer, so we did. We called them repeatedly today and we asked very basic questions. Does this guy, Walker, still work for you and if not, when did he leave the company? And more than anything, are you actually conducting experiments or considering conducting experiments to mutate new and more dangerous coronaviruses because it would be a cash cow?  And if you are doing that or thinking about doing it, have you received any U.S. government funding? Are taxpayers paying for this? And by the way, do you agree with this executive that COVID came from a lab? We didn't have complex questions, very simple ones. We called and emailed Pfizer all day, but despite their famously well-funded PR department, all the lobbying money they spend, they did not get back to us. They refused to answer. "	WARNING Graphic footage calls Pfizer alleged manipulation COVID 19 pandemic powerful exactly big question ways measure ways measure Big Pharma advertise drugs directly

42	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-look-strange-circumstances-jeffrey-epsteins-death	2023-01-25 22:00:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: A look into the strange circumstances around Jeffrey Epstein's death | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson analyzes Jeffrey Epstein's death on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'On Saturday morning, Aug. 10, 2019, Attorney General William Barr was working in his home office when his chief of staff called to say that Jeffrey Epstein had just been found dead in his cell in New York City. Barr was shocked and upset to hear this. His first reaction, as he recounts it in his memoir, was to worry that some people in America might not buy the idea that .  ""No one's going to believe it was a suicide,"" Barr fretted to his chief of staff. ""There will be conspiracy theories all over the place."" Now, that's a pretty odd response, if you think about it. At the time, there was no way that Bill Barr could have known for sure how Jeffrey Epstein died. So, you would think as the attorney general, his first concern would be finding out what actually happened, but instead, his first concern was worry that the public might jump to unapproved conclusions about what happened and, in some ways, Bill Barr was right to worry.  Many Americans did not believe that Jeffrey Epstein had killed himself, given the strange circumstances of his death, stranger than even most people understood at the time, it was going to take a sustained public relations campaign to convince Americans that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but Bill Barr was willing to make the effort. Two days later, he flew to New Orleans, gave a speech and said this.   So, the country is skeptical and concerned. Bill Barr is skeptical and concerned. We will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability, he promised that day, but that turned out to be untrue. Three-and-a-half years after Jeffrey Epstein died, no one has gotten to the bottom of what happened that day, and there has been no accountability for it.  The only people ever punished for the grotesque malfeasance surrounding Epstein's death were two low-level guards who fell asleep on duty that night. Both pleaded guilty to falsifying government records, but last year, with no real explanation, an Obama-appointed judge dropped all charges against both of them. One of the guards may still work for the federal government. As for getting to the bottom of what happened, despite many promises from many various officials, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General has ever issued a report explaining how Jeffrey Epstein died. Not a word. So, once again, three-and-a-half years after one of the most widely covered deaths of our time, there are still no answers and there is still no accountability. Why is that? Well, many reasons, probably, but one of them is that Washington veteran , the only man in the modern era to serve as attorney general twice declared, the Epstein case closed. Now, at first blush, Barr seems to have good reason for doing that. ""By the end of 2019,"" Barr writes in his memoir, ""I was confident that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide by hanging himself."" Now, why did Bill Barr believe that? Well, the first piece of evidence he offers up is this: ""The New York City medical examiner had conducted an autopsy and ruled that Epstein killed himself by hanging."" That's the first piece of evidence. The second is this. It's a videotape that ""confirmed the medical examiner's findings."" ""I personally reviewed that video footage,"" Barr writes. ""It shows conclusively that between the time Epstein was locked in a cell at 7:49 p.m. on the night of Aug. 9 and the time he was discovered the next morning at 6:30, no one entered his tier."" Therefore, Bill Barr explained, we can know for sure that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. In his book, Barr ends this section on Epstein with a self-congratulatory note. ""The management changes I made at the time (to the federal prison system) were good ones, and I think the agency is slowly on its way back.""  In other words, everything is fine now. Let's move on. This was enough for most journalists in Washington. Virtually every subsequent news story about Jeffrey Epstein's death denounced skeptics of the official story as crazy, who, for whatever reason, were engaged in ""baseless conspiracy theories."" What's amazing in retrospect is that none of these reporters, veterans at The Washington Post, the Associated Press, NBC News, The New York Times, many others, none of them ever thought to revisit Bill Barr's assessment of Epstein's death and measure it against the basic tenets of common sense. If you did that, you saw that what Bill Barr said about Jeffrey Epstein was transparently absurd and very obviously dishonest. Barr began by claiming that the medical examiner who conducted Epstein's autopsy ruled his death a suicide, but that is not true. The initial cause of death following the autopsy was not suicide, but ""pending,"" which is to say unclear. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy could not say how Jeffrey Epstein died. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden, who was also present that day, came away believing Epstein had been murdered. After reviewing more than a thousand suicides by hanging in New York state, Baden later said he couldn't find a single neck injury, not one, that matched the injury that Epstein sustained. Jeffrey Epstein did not kill himself, Baden concluded, he was strangled. The physical evidence he saw at the autopsy made that obvious, but New York City's chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, who was not present at the autopsy, overruled the judgment of those who were. Days later, on the basis of no new evidence or investigation, Barbara Sampson simply declared Jeffrey Epstein's death a suicide. That was the city's official but totally unsupported conclusion, which Bill Barr and many others promptly repeated. Why did chief medical examiner Barbara Sampson do that? We don't know. We called Sampson to ask her, but she hung up on us. Then, there's the question of the videotape, which Barr cited. Both cameras trained on the door of Jeffrey Epstein's cell did not work that night famously and to this day, no one has explained why they didn't work. So, the video footage that Bill Barr said he watched didn't cover Epstein's cell, just the entrance to the larger cellblock.   No one came in or out of the tier, Barr said. Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. So, let's consider that claim rationally. On the night of Aug. 9, Jeffrey Epstein was being held in the special housing unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, the most secure part of the city's federal lockup. It would be physically impossible for a stranger to get in and out of this facility without an electronic pass and without being seen by the countless cameras in place between the street and the locked ninth floor of the building. So, if Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, he was not murdered by an intruder, someone who came into the tier, he was murdered by someone on his own cellblock, obviously. There were seven other cells on Epstein's tier and each one housed dangerous criminals. So, if you were looking for a killer, you would figure out who was in those cells, but no one seems to have thought of that or done it. The Bureau of Prisons refused to provide us with a list of the inmates on Epstein's tier. It's not clear how many of them were even interviewed by investigators, despite the fact that some of them were transferred out of the facility shortly after Epstein's death. That's a baffling oversight. Instead, Attorney General Bill Barr simply assured the country that no one from outside came into Jeffrey Epstein's tier and declared the case solved and if you think about it, that is a remarkable way to assess a potential crime scene, especially when you consider the source.  Bill Barr was not a civilian or a crime novel aficionado. He was the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. He was the nation's top cop. His job was to solve crimes and yet, somehow, with all his law enforcement experience, it never seemed to dawn on Bill Barr that if there was a killer, the killer would have come from one of the cells on Epstein's tier and then further, apparently, no one in the entire FBI suggested this to Bill Barr as they reviewed the case. Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General, it doesn't matter what the camera outside the tier shows. What matters is what happened inside the tier. Again, obvious and yet, apparently no one at DOJ ever said that to Bill Barr and no one in the media noticed. It's all very strange and the story gets much stranger once you start pressing a little bit. We've pressed pretty hard for the last few days on this question, not because we have any special affection for Jeffrey Epstein. We've pressed because you don't want to live in a country where it's possible to murder people in federal lockup, cover up the killings, and then get away with them. That's scary.  That should not be allowed in this or any other civilized place, but in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, it appears that it was allowed and on one level, you can see why it was. This is one of those crimes that has no natural constituency pushing to solve it. The only people who liked Jeffrey Epstein were his friends, and some of them are clearly happy he's dead. Here's Bill Gates, whom records show spent quite a bit of time with Jeffrey Epstein after he became a registered sex offender. ""Well, he's dead, along with his many secrets about me and the rest of our friends."" Oh, we're so sorry. So, so sorry. You can imagine that Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and many, many others feel the same way. No one wants to talk about what happened to Jeffrey Epstein, because privately, a lot of people are happy about what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. This week, we've called virtually every person involved in the story surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death and with very few exceptions, none of them would speak to us. Some of them hung up immediately. Others declined all comment.  One of them, the DOJ case officer supposedly assigned to investigate Epstein's death, refused even to acknowledge that he worked for the federal government. ""I'm not going to confirm or deny that,"" said Mr. Lyeson Daniel when we reached him on his cell phone. ""Why is that?"" We asked him. ""I'm not going to confirm or deny that,"" he repeated. For his part, former Attorney General Bill Barr also turned down an offer to come on tonight. He did not explain why. One person we did speak to at length is Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark, his only living relative. The two were never in business together, but Mark Epstein wound up more financially successful, even than his famous sibling. So, he's not looking for money from the estate. He is interested in finding out what happened to his brother.  On the basis of those conversations with Mark Epstein, as well as with a criminal defense attorney called David Schoen, who also knew Jeffrey Epstein well and met with him in a cell shortly before he died, here is a list of questions that any honest investigator would want the answers to. First, why do so many public officials persist in claiming that Jeffrey Epstein attempted suicide in prison once before on July 23, 2019? Now, that's a very convenient claim if you're trying to convince people that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but there's no evidence that it's true.  In fact, Jeffrey Epstein himself adamantly denied ever trying to kill himself in prison or out. He denied this to his friends, to his lawyers and to prison psychologists. He said instead that he was injured by another inmate. That's why he was in the fetal position on the ground. According to David Schoen, who talked to him shortly after that event, Epstein seemed upbeat, happy and confident of his release from jail, but he was very concerned about being hurt by someone in a nearby cell and speaking of nearby cells, were the cells on Epstein's tier locked for the entire night, the night he was killed? We've heard from a source that they were not locked, that inmates were able to move from one cell to another, including into Jeffrey Epstein's cell. Can the Bureau of Prisons give us clarity on this? Can they prove otherwise? And by the way, who moved Jeffrey Epstein's body and who gave the order to do that?  Epstein was discovered the morning of Aug. 10 by a part-time prison guard called Michael Thomas, who amazingly was the very same guard who discovered him in the fetal position on the floor after his previous falsely reported suicide attempt, but by the time the EMTs arrived, Epstein's body had been moved to the prison infirmary. That's a clear violation of federal policy. Who ordered that? And though Jeffrey Epstein had been dead for at least two hours when the guard found him in his cell, by the time the EMTs arrived, Epstein was clad in a hospital gown. That means that somebody, for some reason, cut away Jeffrey Epstein's prison uniform and redressed his stiffening corpse in new clothes. Why would anyone do that?  Then to make it even stranger, Jeffrey Epstein's corpse was intubated, air was blown into his lifeless lungs. It's not clear why. Now, there was handheld video of all of this happening. That might explain it, but that video has never been released. In fact, authorities will not even acknowledge that it exists, but it does exist. Nor has the EMT's account of what they saw that day, their mandatory, so-called prehospital care report, ever been released, nor most strikingly of all, are there photographs of Jeffrey Epstein dead in his cell, and that means it's impossible to know the position of his body when it was found or how he died.    Was Jeffrey Epstein hanging from a bedsheet, as the authorities insist? They say he was strangled by a ligature of his own making. His neck was bloody, but the strip of sheet was not. Or was he killed with the electrical cord from his C-PAP machine for sleep apnea? That's what Dr. Baden concluded, because that would be consistent with his actual injuries at autopsy. These are very basic questions. These are not conspiracy theories. They're obvious questions. They are the essential questions, in fact, in any legitimate investigation, but apparently nobody has even tried to answer them.  We dutifully called the Department of Justice today to ask them to explain some of this. They refused on the grounds that there's ""an active investigation in progress,"" but that is a lie. There is no investigation into . For moving on four years now, there has never been an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death, the death of an American citizen. Now, we can only speculate as to why that is, but all the explanations are bad and ominous. Maybe someone in the new Republican Congress should look into all of this, not because Jeffrey Epstein was an American hero, but because for once it would be nice to see the federal government forced to tell the truth about something. "	analyzes Jeffrey Epstein death Saturday morning Aug 10 2019 Attorney General William Barr home office chief staff Jeffrey Epstein found dead cell York City Barr

A lot of what you read at this point feels not like news, but instead, like some highly curated version of reality crafted to manipulate you. Even if you're not paranoid, you feel like the crazy guy in the bus mumbling about how nothing is real. ""Nothing is real.""So at the very least, it's obvious there's a lot of court intrigue going on in American politics, and only a small percentage of it ever becomes public. One day you wake up and Kamala Harris is the vice president. ""How'd that happen?"" you wonder. No one will say, but you can be sure there's a story there.So here's the latest example of unexplained weirdness in the news. Mike Pence, of all people, has just swooped in to save Joe Biden. Yes. Mike Pence, a man so flamboyantly pure, he won't have dinner with ladies not his wife. And yet  in his house, just like Joe Biden. Bet you didn't see that coming.It wasn't so long ago that Pence was on television saying he was sure he had no classified documents in his possession. He said that a few times. Then just days ago, Mike Pence sent his personal attorney to search his family's home in Carmel, Indiana, for classified documents. Now, if Mike Pence didn't think he had classified documents, why would he send his lawyer to go look for classified documents? We can't say for certain, but it's entirely possible – in fact, it's likely – that Mike Pence was asked to do this by federal prosecutors who are trying to build a case against his old boss, Donald Trump.Now, the point would be to show that not every federal official walks off with state secrets. Donald Trump was uniquely evil in that regard, as in so many others. See, Mike Pence didn't do it. So if that was the plan and we suspect that it was, it backfired spectacularly because Mike Pence's lawyer promptly discovered classified documents. He immediately loaded these documents into his car and drove them back to Washington to hand them over to authorities. Mike Pence, meanwhile, not only notified the National Archives about these new documents, he also called the FBI and then he called leaders of both parties in Congress. Which is odd because what Mike Pence did was a felony. We've heard that again and again. Keeping classified documents at home unsecured is a felony.But Pence didn't seem embarrassed about it at all. In fact, he almost bragged about it. So clearly, Mike Pence is not worried about being punished for keeping secret documents in his home. And that's strange in a country where all laws are supposed to apply equally to all people. But Mike Pence is not worried about FBI raids. And that's interesting. Maybe someday we'll learn why. In the meantime, though, the effect of the media was immediate. If someone as unimpeachably holy as Mike Pence had classified documents in his home, that means that every person who's ever served at a high level of government also has classified documents at home. And that means, by definition, that keeping classified documents in your house is not a big deal except when Donald Trump does it. Mike Pence proves that. If Mike Pence committed the same crime as Joe Biden, Joe Biden must be innocent. That was the media's conclusion. Watch.It's not a big deal. Well, actually, we've got to say it, that's mostly true, and it usually isn't a big deal. As we pointed out, for years now, the federal government has managed to classify more than a billion public documents. Now, the vast majority of these documents, citizens, us, have every right to see. Joe Biden, for example, is still hiding secrets from the Kennedy assassination 60 years ago, not to protect national security, but because the CIA doesn't want to answer questions about its involvement in the murder of an American president. And that's an outrage ia democracy. You should be mad about it. But reporters in Washington are not mad about it. In fact, they're the ones telling you that Julian Assange and Ed Snowden are criminals, not whistleblowers. So the press corps, just like the federal bureaucracy, loves secrecy because secrecy is the key to their power. On the other hand, you can never dismiss any case out of hand because the details are what matters. So in the case of Joe Biden, what exactly was in those classified documents that he took home? The entire story, the question of whether it's a big deal or no big deal at all, hangs on that question. What was in the documents? Why can't you tell us? Well, as of tonight, no one has told us, so we don't know.But thankfully, Miranda Devine of The New York Post may have brought us a little closer to the answer. So she analyzed the documents that we do have, the ones found on  And on that laptop, she found a remarkable email, an email the Justice Department has never shown to the public, despite the fact its agents have had it for years. And the document that Miranda Devine found indicates that Hunter Biden had classified information in his possession. Almost certainly that came from his father, then the vice president. And that he used that information to make piles of money for the Biden family while working at a fake job in Ukraine. That's what it shows.So if there's an actual scandal at the core of this classified documents story, here it is. So here are the details.On April 13, 2014, Hunter Biden sent an email to his business partner in Burisma, Devon Archer. Now, he sent this a week before his father, the vice president, flew to Ukraine to meet with Ukraine's prime minister. In the email, Hunter Biden composed a detailed memo with nearly two dozen data points about the political and strategic situation on the ground in Ukraine. What's so immediately striking and Miranda Devine pointed this out, having read the entire laptop, is that this email bears no resemblance to anything else we have that Hunter Biden has ever written. In fact, it sounded like something produced by the State Department.There's no question that Hunter Biden used classified materials to assemble this email. Listen carefully: ""The strategic values to create a land bridge for RU to Crimea,"" he writes at one point. Notice he uses the diplomatic abbreviation for Russia, RU, because he's in the know. ""That won't directly affect Burisma holdings, but it will limit future UK exploration and utilization of offshore opportunities in particular."" ""It will also,"" Hunter Biden added, ""further destabilize the UK nationally and for whatever government is in power and the US will respond with even stronger sanctions. Those sanctions will threaten the tenuous support of the EU, which does not have the political will to incur steep energy price increases"" and so on.Now, keep in mind, if you're wondering, is this plausible? Keep in mind, when he wrote this email, Hunter Biden was an active drug addict. Just two months before he wrote this, two months, in February of 2014, he'd been thrown out of the Navy for cocaine use. He couldn't even stay sober long enough to pass a scheduled drug test. He was completely out of control. Yet somehow, in that state, in this email, Hunter Biden managed to sound like a seasoned Ukraine hand from Foggy Bottom, referring to Russia as ""RU"" and all the rest. And critically, he seemed to know for a fact the details of American diplomatic strategy in the region. The US will respond with even stronger sanctions. How did Hunter Biden know that? Oh, come on. Come on.Keep in mind that when Mike Flynn mentioned the topic – just mentioned the topic – of sanctions to the ambassador from Russia, the FBI swooped in and destroyed his life and threatened to send him to prison. And he was the National Security Advisor at the time. He had the highest possible clearances you could have. Hunter Biden had no clearances whatsoever. He was the drug addict son of the vice president. And here he is in this email casually mentioning to his business partner that sanctions may be coming, and here are the effects on the EU and energy prices in order to keep making $80 grand a month in a no-show job on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, working on a topic he knew nothing about.So what are we looking at here? What we're looking at . That's a crime. A real one. Hunter Biden clearly knew it was a crime. He told his business partner in the same email to go to CVS and buy a ""burner phone"" to make sure their conversations were not seen by anyone else. Now, what's amazing and so telling is that the DOJ has had this for years because the FBI seized Hunter Biden's laptop before the last presidential election in 2020. Keep in mind also the context. And the context is always Ukraine. That was true in 2014. It's true in 2023. Back in 2015, Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, began investigating Burisma and wondering, ""Why is it paying the vice president's son tens of thousands of dollars a month?"" So how did Joe Biden respond? Well, within a year, Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States, had Shokin fired by threatening to withhold U.S. aid money to Ukraine. We're not making this up. Here's the tape. Arrogance is his weakness. Can you imagine bragging about that? Joe Biden, in front of the Council on Foreign Relations, on camera, just admitted he had the prosecutor fired because the prosecutor was doing what our Department of Justice would not do. He wanted the vice president's son investigated for trading classified information to this business for cash. And Joe Biden just admitted that he acted on behalf of the U.S. government, but actually on behalf of his family. It's a crime. Hunter Biden had access to classified documents. That's a crime. And here he is bragging about it. Hubris is always their undoing.So this really is the scandal right there. It's about Ukraine and it's about the Biden family's stream of income, which was illegitimate. So we put in a very simple request today to the White House and to Hunter Biden. Simple question: Did Hunter Biden ever receive in any form U.S. government classified information about Ukraine? Period. Simple question. Did this happen or did it not happen? Of course, they didn't respond because the answer, very obviously, we know, thanks to the reporting of Miranda Devine, is yes."	give take President Biden

Ever wonder that? The shadowy, heavily armed left wing militia group, the guys dressed like stormtroopers in black masks? You remember them, of course, well, from the summer of 2020, they burned our cities that year. Churches and police stations and courthouses. Now, the point of the violence they committed, the extensive violence and the killings they committed, was to defeat Donald Trump – Make the country so chaotic that voters would want a change, and they were effective in doing that. So effective that Kamala Harris herself raised money to bail them out of jail. In the end, Antifa played a pivotal role in our presidential election that year, more so than any other organized bloc of voters. Then, the moment Joe Biden was inaugurated, Antifa seemed to disappear. Nobody asked any questions about where they went, much less about who they were or who was paying them. They'd served their purpose, and then they left.So in retrospect, it's very clear who Antifa was and is. Antifa is the armed instrument of the permanent Democratic establishment in Washington. Their job is to mobilize when politically necessary. Now, this is a new thing in the United States, but political militia are a common feature in third world politics. They were a staple in Haiti. In our country, however, only one party has them, the Democratic Party. They're the only ones with armed militia in the street. So with that in mind, it's interesting to note that Antifa is back in force, and that's probably not a very good sign for Joe Biden. If nothing else, Antifa has a solid track record of getting rid of sitting presidents. Here's a report from Fox 5 in Atlanta over the weekend:Unleash the wackos. Somebody has unleashed the wackos. There's always a pretext for this. There's always a story. They tell you to pretend it's spontaneous. ""It just happened. They just got so mad that they flew in from all over the country to stage a riot."" Now, the story behind this riot, the one you're seeing on TV, is that a guy called Tortuguita, apparently an Antifa environmentalist, person who uses they/it as pronouns, decided to shoot a state trooper in Georgia, and then the cops shot back and killed it in response.  So that's the story they're telling to explain the riots. It doesn't make a lot of sense, actually. But everyone in the media is running with this, CNN included, and especially. CNN, in fact, turned to a freelance reporter called David Peisner to explain exactly what happened this weekend in Atlanta. Watch this.Why does every neoliberal talk like a sociology professor at a community college? You ever notice that? So that's David Peisner, identified by CNN as a freelance journalist, explaining that actually it's not really violence because it's against property. So when they burn your house down, it's not violence. It's not violence. It's always the same script. Remember when Ali Velshi stood in front of a burning police station in Minneapolis and told you the protests were, quote, ""not generally speaking, unruly ""except for, of course, the torched police station right behind us. When CNN told us the protests, the protests, the riots in Kenosha were ""fiery but mostly peaceful."" Meanwhile, people were being killed. They're still saying it, but this time they're even lazier and more corrupt. That freelance reporter  you just saw on CNN is not actually a reporter. He's a professional Antifa apologist. He is a fellow traveler for Antifa. And we're not just guessing at that. This week, he went on Twitter to raise money for Antifa, including a GoFundMe for Tortuguida, the attempted cop killer with the confusing pronouns. That's the guy CNN is calling a reporter.So the question is not is CNN dishonest? Oh, they'll say anything.The question is why this particular brand of dishonesty. Why the same people who warned you about right-wing extremists walking around the Capitol, running cover for domestic terrorism in the city they're based in? Keep in mind, this is CNN saying this, and it was CNN whose headquarters, it's world headquarters, CNN Center in Atlanta, was destroyed by Antifa in May of 2020 after Saint George Floyd died. Remember that?So that day in May of 2020, Antifa actually got inside CNN Center. They smashed through the windows and went right in. So if you're CNN, you'd say, ""Well, look, we're going to have to put Antifa on the 'do not promote' list. We just can't, we just can't run cover for the people who smash the windows of our world headquarters."" But they are. They're doing it anyway. Why are they doing that? Because CNN is not actually on the left. They have no ideology or beliefs. CNN is above all and always foursquare on the side of the people in charge. Always. That's whO they run cover for. So they're not actually defending Antifa. They're defending the people who benefit from Antifa. And that's the Democratic Party.And in case you doubt the connection, consider Representative Katherine Clarke of Massachusetts, she/her. Katherine Clarke is one of the senior Democrats in the House of Representatives. In fact, she's the Minority Whip. She's the one who was so worried about climate change. Remember, she told you that her kids were having nightmares about it? Didn't stop her from buying $1,000,000 oceanfront home, but whatever. So Katherine Clarke's own son, Jared Dowell, was riding along with Antifa in Boston on Saturday night. He was vandalizing a monument on Boston Common when police tried to arrest him. Jared Dowell and other protesters then assaulted the police, causing the specific officer to bleed from the nose and mouth. Oh, that was her son.So Katherine Clarke was forced to issue a statement about this, of course. By the way, stop talking about her personal life. If you knew what the personal lives of the people who run the Democratic Party are actually like, you would understand their politics much better. So Katherine Clarke issued a statement and refers to her son as her ""daughter"" – Huh? Of course – and wrote that ""This is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting."" It's just, you know, part of the cycle where your adult son pretends to be a woman and attacks police officers. It's totally normal, it's just part of the cycle of parenting. Yeah. Again, if you knew the details of their personal lives, you would understand their politics. This is the party of weak men and unhappy women.But what you have in effect here is the official endorsement of domestic terrorism from the highest level of the Democratic Party. And why wouldn't you? Again, this is their militia. These are their state-sanctioned shock troops, and they are effectively immune from criticism. So you go to jail for owning a 10-round magazine, but they get to do whatever they want.  and Christopher Wray, who runs the FBI, are making certain that every last January 6 defendant spends years in jail. Their lives are destroyed, on the no fly list. And yet Antifa terrorists get released almost as soon as they're arrested.This week in Atlanta, the police arrested the 22-year-old son of a surgeon in Kennebunkport, Maine, called Francis Carroll. Now, in case you're wondering who these people are, well, they come from the key Democratic demographic, which, of course, is not people of color, working people. That's nonsense. The key Democratic demographic is upscale professionals and their lunatic children. So this kid grew up in a $2 million mansion – pictures of him on his father's yacht. He was arrested on domestic terrorism charges a month ago in Atlanta. He assaulted police officers and terrorized residents. Is he still there? No. He got out of jail immediately. So then apparently he went again to an Antifa riot. This weekend in Atlanta, police say Carroll went out and committed some more domestic terrorism, including arson. So why does this kid, the rich kid, get off when the people who showed up at the Capitol, consistent with their constitutional rights, to complain about what really did seem like fraud in the 2020 election, they went to jail?Well, have you ever checked the percentage of January 6 defendants who've experienced a personal bankruptcy? Much higher than average. These were actual working class people, deeply frustrated, completely out of options and unheard by everyone in Washington. It's not an excuse for the vandalism some of them committed. But it tells you it's a very different group of people. They didn't go to Middlebury or some other liberal arts madrassa. They're actual working people. But they're in jail and the rich kids are out. Is anyone going to ask Merrick Garland to explain that? Is anyone going to ask what Antifa is? Who leads this group? How many more riots do they have to lead before the New York Times gets interested and does a five-part series on what is this? Who are these people? Who pays for this? Where do they stay at night? What's their background? Give us some news on Antifa. They're the biggest armed militia in the United States, and we know nothing about them. Why? Because they're aligned with the Democratic Party.But they're telling you the real threat is rural voters with AR-15s, assault weapons. You must disarm Republican voters. No, thanks. Disarm? Why don't you go ahead and disband Antifa? Go full RICO on them. Let's find out who their leaders are. Let's see them in jail. Then maybe you can tackle street crime and then pay a little bit of attention to the drug cartels that control the southwestern United States. And then maybe at that point, you will convince some people to register their AR-15s, But until you do that, up yours."

Pretty much everything is precisely the opposite of what they claim it is. So the people who tell you they're defending democracy are promoting authoritarianism, which is not democracy. Then the Black Lives Matter movement winds up killing Black people. Who would have seen that coming? Then our public health authorities make the population sicker. And this is our new favorite. The so-called World Economic Forum seems to exist to destroy national economies. Not an overstatement. It was the WEF, keep in mind, that told the government of Sri Lanka to give up modern fertilizer. Oh, good plan, guys. Go ahead and try it. Result? The country collapsed and people starved. Then it was the WEF that promoted  the biggest financial fraud in history. Apparently the savants at the World Economic Forum just couldn't tell that this twitchy, pill-popping kid in cargo shorts, who literally played video games during interviews, was an utterly transparent scammer. They had no idea. They thought he was a genius, just like them.And of course it was the WEF that predicted the COVID lockdowns would ""quietly improve cities,"" not turn them into ominous hellscape of unemployment, drug addiction and crime. It seemed like a good plan at the time. ""Hey, I've got an idea. Let's prevent people from working. That'll make them rich. It'll quietly improve life for everyone."" That's the World Economic Forum for you. The WEF is often described as a group of supervillains, but they're also hilariously idiotic – not just evil, buffoonish. And by the way, they know it. They're smart enough to be embarrassed anyway. The WEF has since deleted its tweet about COVID lockdowns. It has memory hold. Its promotion of scammer Sam Bankman-Fried. It has conveniently forgotten all about its guidance on Sri Lankan fertilizer, on which it turns out the WEF is not an expert. None of that ever happened. The slate is clean.So we're ready for yet another World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which is under way right now. The event kicked off this week with 84-year-old Klaus Schwab. He's the founder of the WEF, promising to ""master the future.""""We must masters the future, master the future."" So, mastering the future is now the top item on the to-do list at the World Economic Forum this year. That's the first clue these people are not living the same life you are. By the end of this week, you hope to find some time to get an oil change or maybe pick up some dandruff shampoo at Rite Aid. At the World Economic Forum, they plan to master the future. That's the kind of people they are. How are they going to do it, by the way? Well, they're going to do it with John Kerry, who, despite physical appearances, is still alive. Kerry will be 80-years old this year, so it goes without saying that if he's going to master the future, he'd better hurry. Thankfully, he's got a plan. Watch.""So most people don't understand, but we are a select group of human beings."" John Kerry tells the attendees of the World Economic Forum, who honestly did not need to be reminded of that. People may say we're crazy, tree-hugging, liberal do-gooders, but we know the truth, which is that actually we are soulless greedhead money worshipers who'd sell our own children to China for a big enough tax credit. Shout out to you, Larry Fink in the third row. Catch you at the sushi bar. That was  at the World Economic Forum, which is also effectively the WEF credo. But then John Kerry went further. What we're doing today, he said, in saving the planet, is almost ""extraterrestrial."" In other words, if you ever suspect that these people are freaking aliens, it turns out you're right. They are.And as if to prove it, Al Gore himself showed up. At 74-years old, Al Gore is as awkward, synthetic and weird as he has ever been since eighth grade to now. Though at this point, he's much, much richer thanks to Google stock. Ever notice how the richer people get, the more they seem like Bill Gates. It's not your imagination. Al Gore single handedly proves that theory. Here he was today. Always angry, always shouting. Fatter, but still grumpy. They're climate refugees now. They're climate refugees, millions of them. They're not economic migrants fleeing the squalor of Tegucigalpa for the generous social services of El Paso. No, they're not. They're climate refugees who have no choice but to risk their lives with coyotes because you drive a full-size Silverado. Illegal immigration is your fault, middle America. It's not our fault. We've got nothing to do with it. We just run the world.If this is all starting to sound like a bad CNN segment to you, a parade of self-confident, dumb people, rich in self-esteem, low in wisdom, giving moralizing lectures to one another's applause, well, let us confirm that for you. Where was Don Lemon? Why wasn't he there? Well, he wasn't. That's on next year's program, no doubt. This year - we're not making this up - America's favorite unemployed media critic. Mr. Brian Stelter, ladies and gentlemen. Watch.""Make up for all the crazy."" The conclusion this year at the World Economic Forum is that people who are not at the World Economic Forum have too much free speech, too many bad ideas, too much crazy and too much opportunity to talk. They're still talking out there. Stop them before they talk some more. So if you're getting the impression that the world's most mediocre people and least self-aware people are all congregating in Switzerland this week, you are on to something. In fact, it might be worth getting an attendee list just to make certain that not a single person who was there this week ever has power over you in any way. If one of these people shows up supervising the bake sale at your kid's school, call the police. They're not qualified.So with that in mind, it was interesting to see Florida congresswoman Maria Salazar there. Maria Salazar hasn't been in Congress very long, but she has spent her time laser focused on helping foreign nationals come to this country illegally. Her own constituents? No concern. People in other countries coming here to go on welfare? Oh, yeah. Before Maria Salazar was even inaugurated, she posted a video on Twitter promising Nicaraguans and Hondurans in Central America that she would ""be there for them"" to ""help and assist"" in ""everything the American government can do for them."" Not what they might do for our country as new immigrants, how they might build the country, make it better, unite it, make it more prosperous, peaceful. No. What the American government can do for people. The American government owes nothing to those who are breaking laws the American government passed. That's She's in Davos this week, of course. And during her time in Davos, it goes without saying, she demanded amnesty for tens of millions of foreign nationals living in our country illegally. Watch.""Millions of people who look like me."" Don't you love it when white people pretend that the people streaming across our border look like me? Sorry, Maria Salazar, you are whiter than I am. So, knock it off. It's false. And by the way, you don't represent foreign nationals in the United States here illegally. You represent Americans because you're a representative of the American government. Donald Trump went to the economic forum in Davos some years ago and made it really clear that he represents, as the American president, Americans, not people from foreign countries living in the United States illegally. Now, a person who claims to be in his party is making exactly the opposite claim. Marie Salazar has been on this show before. We'd love to have her on again. That offer remains open always."	gives take World Economic Forum mediocre attendees paying attention past five six probably noticed inverted nature modern language Pretty much everything precisely

Sheila Jackson Lee's latest legislation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' is famous in Washington for being the single most obnoxious member of Congress. Now, that's a title that, as you can imagine, has many contenders, but Sheila Jackson Lee stands alone.  she once screamed at a flight attendant in the first-class cabin on a Continental flight.  In the 1990s, during a visit to NASA, Sheila Jackson Lee demanded to see the flag that astronauts had planted on Mars. When gently informed that no human being has ever been to Mars because it's very far away, Lee flew into a rage. She accused NASA of  and pointed out her membership on the ""science committee"" in Congress and so on. We could spend the entire hour on Sheila Jackson Lee stories and it's tempting.  On Capitol Hill, she's known as the queen and not in a good way, but what's interesting is that nobody ever talks about the congressional district that Sheila Jackson Lee supposedly represents. It's mostly inner-city Houston and it could use some help. Lee's district has a poverty rate almost twice the national average, all the usual markers of civilizational decline—high crime, bad schools, low social cohesion, drugs. Now, Lee has served in Congress for nearly 30 years, but it's hard to think of a single thing she has ever done to improve the lives of the people who elected her. She doesn't seem interested. Instead, Sheila Jackson Lee has devoted her entire political career and her entire life to a single cause-shrieking about White racism. That's what Sheila Jackson Lee does for a living. Here's a selection:     Racism, you see, is a national security threat. It's a national security threat. Really, Sheila Jackson Lee? Tell us how racism is a national security threat. Speak slowly. We've got plenty of time, but of course, she won't do that. She's got no argument. She's got no facts. She doesn't even have a sincere belief in what she's saying. It's absurd and she knows it and by the way, Sheila Jackson Lee doesn't want to protect a country she despises from national security threats. Why would she want to do that? No, that's not the point. What she's doing here every day is leveling a racial attack, a blood libel, against an entire group of Americans while simultaneously pretending to be the victim of attacks from that same group. , she howls as she punches you in the face. It's such a common tactic at this point, used constantly by Al Sharpton, by the ADL, by so many others that you may not even notice it anymore, but it's still disgusting. It's still immoral. It's still divisive. Here's Joe Biden doing it. Speaking of blood libel, because that's what it is, protesting the 2020 election result is the same as slavery, as the KKK. It's the same as murdering Martin Luther King. It's all White supremacy, declares Joe Biden without defining the term. Now, you may recall when Joe Biden said that. You probably dismissed it at the time as ridiculous, as the rantings of a senile partisan and, of course, that's what it was, but you should also keep in mind that Joe Biden did not say that by accident. It wasn't an ad lib, off the cuff. No, his staff signed off on that speech. They wrote it. They read it before he read it.  And they wrote it for a reason. When the president of the United States identifies a threat to this country, his many federal agencies, the biggest in the world, swing into action to neutralize that threat. That's how the system works, as Joe Biden's staff well knows. So, in fact, when Joe Biden likens you to al-Qaeda or the Klan, it's not a small thing at all. It has implications. So, here's Sheila Jackson Lee from last week in a not unrelated clip calling for the renewal of the Patriot Act. Watch.  I Well, it's kind of strange if you think about it. Why would Sheila Jackson Lee, a self-described liberal, find herself last week praising the secret government courts that liberals once opposed passionately on the grounds that those courts could be used to destroy the constitutional rights of Americans without anyone knowing about it? Secret courts? Liberals were against secret courts and now the chief liberal in Congress is strongly for secret courts. What's going on here? Why? Well, because those secret courts turn out to be a highly effective way to silence the critics of the Democratic Party, to silence those so-called White supremacists Joe Biden's always yelling about, not all of whom, by the way, are White. You don't have to be White to be a White supremacist. You just have to oppose the agenda and of course, Sheila Jackson Lee knows that very well and that's why she wants to renew the Patriot Act indefinitely and there are enough dumb Republicans that she may be able to, but Sheila Jackson would like to go a lot further than that. Lee has just introduced a bill called the Leading Against White Supremacy Act of 2023.  Now, it's not an exaggeration to say this single bill would do more to criminalize speech, previously constitutionally guaranteed speech, than any other piece of legislation that has been proposed in the entire history of this country. That's not an overstatement at all and to prove it, we're going to read directly from the bill here. It is ""A conspiracy to engage in White supremacy inspired hate crime shall be determined to exist between two or more persons, at least one of whom published material advancing White supremacy, White supremacist ideology, antagonism based on 'replacement theory' or hate speech that vilifies or is otherwise directed against any nonwhite person or group."" Now, nowhere in the legislation is the term ""White supremacy"" or ""White supremacist ideology"" ever defined. Of course, it's never defined. It's left open. It's subjective. Anything can be White supremacy, but the bill does specifically point to something called replacement theory, White supremacist ideology. If you engage in either one of them, you go to federal prison possibly for a very long time. So, all that's required under this piece of legislation, which is not being laughed out of Congress yet, all that's required is that your political opinions ""could as determined by a reasonable person, motivate actions by a person predisposed to engaging in a White supremacy inspired hate crime."" So, what would qualify as a felony under this law? Well, virtually everything, but among them would be pointing out the Democratic Party politicians, including Chuck Schumer, the leading Senate Democrat, have long bragged that they are flooding this country with immigrants in order to change the demography to maintain political power for themselves. They've said that many times. They've written it. They bragged about it on camera, but if you notice it under this bill, you would be criminally responsible for the violent acts of people you have never met and you would go to jail for terrorism. Now, what's most interesting about this bill is that it's race specific. Nothing in Sheila Jackson Lee's legislation would apply to, say, Black supremacy or murder sprees by people who aren't White supremacists, the massacre in Waukesha, for example. So, that means that Democratic Party politicians can continue to say whatever they want with impunity.  The First Amendment still applies to them, but not to anyone who doesn't vote for them. That's the definition of tyranny. It's horrifying. It's a direct attack on the Bill of Rights, on our core freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. government for 250 years. We shouldn't be surprised by this, however, because it's consistent with what Biden has promised, has promised the day he got into office and the promise was that race blind justice, which is the entire foundation of the rule of law in the West, has been for centuries, is done.  The new model? South Africa. That's the new model. South Africa—a country we never talk about because no one wants to admit what's happened there over the past 29 years, But on the basis of that, Biden tried to allocate farm aid on the basis of skin color. A federal judge blocked that plan, but it has not stopped the Democratic Part because no one's repudiated the idea. No one on the right has been brave enough to say ""No. The federal government can never award or punish on the basis of skin color. That is immoral and is contrary to American law"" and because no one has said that, Democrats, including Sheila Jackson Lee, have decided that their opponents are terrorists and they're terrorists because of their race and once you're a terrorist, what do we get to do? We can take all your stuff. We get to seize your assets. It shouldn't surprise you that is actually unfolding in the state of California, always the leading edge of lunacy. Watch this.   Now, everything about this, of course, is bad and wrong—not just in practice, but in principle. In practice, it sets up an incentive that the whole country is going to have to grapple with fairly soon. We've already been told that you can change your sex or immutable characteristic just by wishing it so. Men can become women. Women can become men. Why, then, can't people change their race? That's a sincere question that is waved away is ridiculous, but it's not any more ridiculous than changing your sex. In fact, it's the same.  Under laws like this, there is a huge incentive to change your race because you get paid for doing that. What are we going to do about that? But what's interesting and sadly, sadly predictable, is that as politicians in California and the rest of the country decide how they're going to loot the Treasury in the name of racial justice, the communities they supposedly serve are falling apart in real, tangible, measurable ways. People are dying. Axios, for example, reports that carjackings in D.C. have risen for the fifth straight year. Ask anyone who lives there. Ask the D.C. Council candidate who was carjacked in broad daylight a year ago.   So, instead of doing anything about that in D.C., the leaders are doing what Sheila Jackson Lee does –  shrieking about White racism as if that's the problem, or even a related problem. Of course, it has nothing to do with carjackings. As for actual carjackings that are killing people, making taxpayers leave D.C., terrifying everyone in the city, well, the D.C. City Council has just passed a bill that will lighten the punishment for carjacking as well as other violent crimes.  Here's what you have: At the same time that Sheila Jackson Lee would like to make it a ""hate crime,"" a felony, for disagreeing with her, her compatriots in D.C. and across the country are making it easier for you to get killed by an actual carjacker. Anarcho-tyranny is the name of that system, and it's spreading because no one's saying anything about it.  "	WARNING Graphic footage voices concerns Rep Sheila Jackson Lee latest legislation famous

57	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-bigger-than-just-story-classified-documents	2023-01-16 22:16:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: This is bigger than just a story about classified documents | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson finds irony in the classified documents cases engulfing Biden and Trump on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'You may not remember a whole lot about it, but the second and final presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is actually a fascinating piece of history. And it's well worth rewatching. We actually did it today because we had time off. Now, Trump showed up with a political killshot. He had proof that Joe Biden had been selling access to the US government to hostile foreign regimes. Trump knew that, and we know it from the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop.But Joe Biden, as you may recall, did not even respond. That's ""Russian disinformation,"" he said. And then he went on the offense. ""Show us your tax returns,"" Biden demanded. ""Show us your tax returns."" And, of course, Trump refused. Biden, by contrast, already set up a website called Joe Biden.com to showcase his own recent tax returns because he had nothing to hide. Unlike Donald Trump, you can trust Joe Biden. That was the message.Now, why are we telling you this tonight? Why are we dredging up history? Well, we're doing it because two years later, the roles have reversed in a bewildering and pretty remarkable and kind of hilarious way. So we now have Donald Trump's tax returns. House Democrats grabbed them. Law and precedent and privacy be damned. Privacy? And  to the public because Donald Trump is orange and bad and has no protections under the Bill of Rights. So now that we have Trump's tax returns, what do they show? Well, they show that Donald Trump got a lot poorer once he got into politics. In fact, he may be the only person in Washington you can say that about. Whatever you think of Trump, it turns out he was not in it for the money. Hardly.As for Joe Biden, well, you can't say that about Joe Biden. Joe Biden has never had a private sector job. For more than 50 years, he has worked at your expense for the US government. Yet somehow he's gotten rich in the process. How did that happen? How did Joe Biden do that? Well, Joe Biden does not want you to know. So now, this is the great part. Joe Biden is the one who is hiding his tax returns. Joe Biden.com no longer links to Joe Biden's tax returns for the years 2016 to 2018. As of tonight, those links have been deactivated. If you go there, you will find yourself taken by force to a Democratic party fundraising website. So in other words, stop asking questions and give us money.But it does make you wonder what exactly was happening from 2016 to 2018 that Joe Biden might want to hide. Fair question, but no one in the media seems interested in finding the answer. We do know that during that same period, 2016 to 2018, there was a lot of weird accounting going on at Joe Biden's house in Delaware, the same house where yet another cache of classified documents was just found. Yet another.In 2018, Hunter Biden was looking to rent property in California. Now, in a background check form as part of his rental application, Hunter Biden claimed that, in fact, he owned the Delaware house that Joe Biden, his dad, says that he owned. So they're both claiming to own the same house. Hunter Biden then also listed the address of that house as his primary residence on his driver's license, an official government document. Now, this is the very same home where Joe Biden has spent a third of his presidency in addition to his beach house in Rehoboth without maintaining any visitor logs.Now this is worth knowing. And we don't know this because The New York Times or ABC News dispatched one of its crack reporters who found it. No. We know it because an anonymous Twitter account called @JJTalking found this background check form on Hunter Biden's laptop. Miranda Devine of the New York Post has also done extensive reporting on it. And the document raises quite a few questions, not all of which we can answer, by the way. But the obvious ones include: Did Hunter Biden actually buy his father's home in Delaware? Was he making rent payments to live there? Does that amount that he was paying refer to another property?It was a big amount. On the form, Hunter Biden claims he's paying nearly $50,000 a month in housing costs. $50,000 a month. Where'd that money come from? You wouldn't think  would be able to earn that kind of money at the time, this is pre-laptop. But Hunter Biden had already been thrown out of the U.S. Navy for cocaine use. He'd already abandoned a rental car with a crack pipe inside along with his I.D. He had already left his wife for his sister-in-law. Now, all of this was public information. So how did a disgraced drug addict with no job skills make enough money to make a $50,000 a month payment? Who is paying and how much are they paying him, and why were they paying him? And by the way, what classified documents keep appearing in homes that Hunter Biden lived in? Those seem like fair questions. We have a right to ask them. Joe Biden doesn't feel like answering them. Watch.Are you sure there are no more -- well, he's not sure. He's not sure of anything at this point, including what direction he's walking. But they're not even bothering his staff to answer questions any more on this topic, because every statement they've given so far, including statements carefully crafted by their attorneys, has proven to be completely false. So, for example, on January 12, which wasn't that long ago, Karine Jean-Pierrre, the oracle, the spokeslady at the White House, assured us that all classified documents in Joe Biden's possession had already been found.What? She didn't say there were more documents. They're hiding everything, they're lying about everything. In fact, more documents were just found in Joe Biden's home. Clearly, an effort to undermine Joe Biden by his own party and make sure that he doesn't run again. But also an example of breaking the law because having classified documents in your home is, as we have learned, following the Mar a Lago raid in August, a felony and a threat to this nation's security. But CNN isn't that concerned. On CNN, this weekend, its crack investigators assured us they've already looked into this and everything's fine.So notice the framing here. CNN is not concerned about what the President of the United States has done or not done, whether he's broken the law or not, what the contents of these classified documents might be. What are these classified documents, by the way? Why don't we know? Can you generally categorize them for us? Are they nuclear secrets? Do they pertain to China, Ukraine? What is this?CNN doesn't want to know. What they want to talk about is criticism from Republicans. It's about Republicans. They're saying Joe Biden's a mastermind and he's senile. But, you know, in saying that, at best, Joe Biden is living the life he's lived for quite some time, which is as the source of cash for his ne'er do well son and his ne'er do well brother who've made a fortune from hostile foreign governments. And again, we're not guessing at that. Hunter Biden already admitted it on TV.What role do you think that played?That lady is no longer on TV, by the way, for some reason. Maybe the questions were too tough. But in any case, this all of a sudden is looking a lot more complicated and possibly bigger than just a story about classified documents being misplaced at Biden's homes or next to his Corvette. This might be a clue to the vexing question of how Joe Biden, who was a senator for several lifetimes, was able to have all these huge houses in Delaware over the years. His wife didn't work at Goldman Sachs. She sort of taught at a community college, kind of. Dr. Jill. Not actually a doctor, by the way.So is it possible that Joe Biden's lifestyle was financed by his son and his son's dealings with foreign governments? Apparently, he shared a bank account with his son. Keep in mind that when Hunter Biden left his wife and three children, they were effectively broke. Could it be that the money was going to Joe Biden, whose home Hunter Biden, quote, ""owned."" Hmm. We don't know. But these are interesting, interesting questions. At the very least, the media have basically conceded the smaller point that Joe Biden was illegally in possession of classified documents. They're admitting that. The former deputy director of the FBI analyzing a news story. What's interesting, if you take three steps back, is that, say, three months ago, if you ask anybody who follows politics, who are the main contenders for the ? Well, of course they would be Joe Biden, the current president, and Donald Trump, the last president. And those are the same two people who now are under federal investigation for mishandling documents – one of the stupidest charges in our criminal code and one of the easiest to manipulate for political ends. So who's the winner here? Well, the permanent bureaucracy, who has just decided who can and cannot run for president. Maybe you love Trump, maybe you hate Trump. Maybe you love Biden, maybe you hate Biden. But if you're an American voter, you have a right to decide because it's a democracy. You get to decide who the president is with your votes. Peter Strzok and the creeps at the FBI, the people who never leave D.C., who actually run the government, they don't get to decide because that's not democracy. That's something much darker. And yet the two main candidates are now subject to independent counsel investigations. So voters are no longer in charge. The people who actually run the government are in charge. That's interesting."	finds irony classified documents cases engulfing Biden Trump may remember whole second final presidential debate Joe Biden Donald Trump fascinating piece history worth rewatching

Welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Remember when Sam Bankman-Fried showed up in Washington wearing a t-shirt and spouting nonsense, and all the self-described geniuses declared him a hero? The media, the Congress, the White House, they all love this weird little guy called Sam Bankman-Fried. Do you remember that?Somehow we were reminded of it today when the president of Ukraine arrived , dressed like the manager of a strip club and started to demand money. Amazingly, no one threw him out. Instead, they did whatever he wanted. American taxpayers declare Joe Biden will continue to give Zelenskyy whatever he demands for, quote, ""as long as it takes."" Tellingly, Biden never specified what ""it"" is. As long as it takes to do what? Push the Russian army back to pre-invasion borders? Sounds reasonable.That's what most Americans likely assume, those who are still paying attention. But that is not what Zelenskyy means, and it is not what he is asking for. Zelenskyy is demanding regime change in Russia, just like in Iraq and Libya, and a long list of other failed states. Except this time, in the heart of the Eurasian landmass, next door to the entire civilized world. That's what Zelenskyy has called for repeatedly, and every dollar we send to him goes toward that end. At this point, he's getting a lot closer to achieving it. So what happens if he ""wins?"" What does the ensuing chaos look like? Thought about that? Who's going to secure the world's largest nuclear arsenal once we help Zelenskyy topple the Russian government? Who replaces Putin? Strangely, those topics did not come up today because that wasn't the point. The point of today's visit to Washington was not to make the world more stable or make wise decisions, much less to help America. That's always at the bottom of the list. The point was to fawn over the Ukrainian strip club manager and hand him billions more dollars from our own crumbling economy. It is hard, in fact, it may be impossible to imagine a more humiliating scenario for the greatest country on earth. And we would love to blame Joe Biden for it. But we can't really, not entirely, at least.This was bipartisan masochism. The uniparty is alive and well despite the best efforts of voters, including last month. And if you doubt that it's alive and well, here's a picture of Zelenskyy that he had taken with a group of elderly Republican senators in Kiev back in May. They stand grinning next to him in their orthopedic shoes. 70-year old Susan Collins, John Barrasso, John Cornyn, led by their 80-year old ringleader, Mitch McConnell. 44-year old Zelenskyy poses between them in a skintight polo shirt, flexing like a weightlifter and trying to look ferocious. They seem awestruck. Not since a young Fidel Castro showed up in New York wearing battle fatigues has this country's aging leadership class tittered more loudly in delight. They love a man in uniform. What a hunk. So strong and decisive. Look at the expression in Mitch McConnell's face, you could almost hear the giggles of pleasure.No rational person assessing the issues ever would have predicted this moment. If you were a Republican officeholder and , maybe you would for a moment, ask him about his current and ongoing war against Christianity in Ukraine. Especially if you were, say, Mitch McConnell or John Cornyn and a lot of your own voters go to church on Sunday. They might care about that issue. But McConnell and Cornyn didn't mention it. They didn't say a word. You will not hear a word on television tonight about the fact that Zelenskyy has banned an entire ancient Christian denomination in Ukraine and then seized churches and then thrown priests into jail. According to Mitch McConnell, who apparently hasn't left his office since the mid-eighties, anti-Christian despotism is what most Republicans want above all. They don't get enough. They're just begging for it. Watch McConnell explain.And two other senators stand behind him, nodding like it's true. Defeating Putin is, quote, ""the number one priority among Republicans,"" says Mitch McConnell, who leads Republicans in the Senate. Number one? Before our own economy? Or our own children's schools? Or, for that matter, before the more than 2000 young people killed last year by fentanyl in Mitch McConnell's ""home state"" of Kentucky? Punishing Vladimir Putin for putting Donald Trump in office is more important than all of that says Mitch McConnell. Ukraine's borders matter. Ours don't matter. You may have suspected they thought that. But at this point, they're just coming out and saying this right in your face. And of course, the White House agrees completely. Watch Joe Biden announce today that you'll be paying for evermore advanced weapons systems to be sent to Ukraine, whether you like it or not.He's reading his little script. Maybe it was written by the defense contractors that just hosted an event in Washington for the Ukrainian ambassador. Literally, they put their logos on the invitation just in case there was any question about what's going on here. So this is a big change from what we had last month. But you wouldn't know that from the media coverage of it. Your average reporter in Washington likes Zelenskyy a lot more than he likes you. So nobody asks about it. But this is a major policy change. It was just a few months ago that a senior U.S. defense official said, and we're quoting, ""There is no discussion about putting a  in Ukraine. In order to do that, you would have to put U.S. troops with it to operate.""In other words, you would have to fight a hot war against Russia, which has not only not been approved by the Congress, but most Americans have no idea that's happening. But now it is happening. Did you know that? Are you for that? Is it the most important thing? More important than your nephew dying of fentanyl? Yes, says Mitch McConnell. But it's just the beginning. Because as you just saw, Zelenskyy has arrived in Washington to make more demands. He's the houseguest who would not leave. And every moment we tolerate him, the demands become bigger. In case you missed it. Here's part of what he said just a moment ago.So the leader of a foreign government dressed in a sweatshirt waltzes into the United States Congress and starts demanding money. And then has the gall to tell the people sitting there, who are giving him tens of billions of dollars more of your money, that it is not charity, it's an investment. Really, what are the returns on that? And by the way, what's the point of it? What is the goal here? What's the justification for it? Do we have a historic debt to Ukraine? Do we have a historic animosity with a non-Soviet Russia? No, no. How do we win here? What's in it for us? Isn't this our country? And where do you get off talking to us like that? Do we hate ourselves so much? Do we have so little respect for the United States of America that we put up with that, that we'll applaud it? Thank you, sir. May I have another? What's wrong with us? What's wrong with our leaders? And where is this going?"	reacts Ukrainian President Zelenskyy address Congress far ever addressed United States Congress sweatshirt love much love Remember Sam Bankman Fried showed Washington wearing

This past summer, with just a few months to go before the midterm elections, the Biden administration faced a huge problem called the economy. Most voters vote on the basis of the economy and how they feel they're doing and how they feel their country is doing. And their country at the time was not doing well.The US economy had just recorded two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. That's not just an academic observation. That's a technical . Two quarters. Declining GDP. Recession. We're not making that up. You'll find it in every economics textbook ever written. Go look up the one you used in college. But the Biden administration could not admit that. If they admitted that the US was in a recession, they would lose the Senate. They would lose control of both chambers of the Congress. So they had to lie about it.But how do you lie about something that's so easily defined, that everyone can see? Well, you just change the definition. And that's what they did. They came up with a new definition of recession. So don't look at GDP. That's the old way, the racist way of assessing the economy. Look at holistic factors. Let's look at the labor market, for example. The labor market. Well, then, in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave them ammunition for their case. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report that showed the labor market was strong. They determined that the US economy had added more than a million jobs in the second quarter of this year, from March to June. A million jobs. That's a big deal. It's a big story. And of course, Joe Biden wasted no time in touting it. Watch.A million new jobs in the second quarter despite negative growth. Wait a second. How do you get a million new jobs with negative growth? That seems like magic. How is that possible? But no one in the media asked questions. Instead, they repeated the White House line, which was the BLS report -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics report -- showing a million new jobs proves we can't be in a recession. They all said it, quote, ""The jobs report suggests the Biden economy is not in a recession,"" wrote The New York Times. And then, of course, there were other stories like that, too. So on the basis of that and other factors, they won. They now have control of the Senate.And now we get to learn the truth. A million new jobs, really? The Philadelphia Fed decided to check those numbers and they found the US economy did not add more than a million jobs in the second quarter of this year. Instead, the net additional jobs was about 10,000. So that's less than 1% of the job growth the administration claimed. That's not a rounding error. That's not a minor math mistake. This is a country that supposedly sent a man to the moon. We can do math, right? This isn't like thinking you had 100 bucks in your pocket and finding out you had 85. This is like claiming you had $1,000,000 in your pocket and finding out you had $10,000. This is like claiming you were rich when you were actually bankrupt. This is a lie.So how'd they get it wrong by more than a million jobs? How did they construct this lie? Well, as of tonight, we're not really sure. We now know the BLS numbers didn't just help Joe Biden, though. There was another purpose. These fake numbers also gave the chairman of the Federal Reserve, , a justification to continue raising interest rates. On the basis of that report, they can raise rates. Here was Powell just a few days ago. Ooh. Every word of that a lie. The justification is a lie. And in fact, as Powell well knows, there are 7 million American men of working age who are not working. They're watching the Internet all day. So why are they lying to us about this? Well, the effects are very obvious. Go try and take out a car loan or a home loan or any kind of loan. Or if you have a loan, it's got an adjustable rate, watch how much more you're paying per month. So why are they doing this? Well, the administration wants Powell to raise rates because they think it'll offset the  that Joe Biden's policies have caused.But this is a huge problem for everyone else. Raising rates when the economy is faltering and people don't have jobs. If you keep doing that, you could cause an actual collapse. That seems like the course they put us on. The Biden administration got the interest rate hike it wanted even when the labor market has been flatlining. William Beach runs the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Marty Walsh runs the Department of Labor. They need to explain why anyone should ever trust the most basic economic numbers the government issues ever again. And it's one thing to get the numbers wrong, but then to base future policies on numbers you know are wrong, what is that? That's what they're doing. Jerome Powell should probably answer that question fairly soon. He won't join us tonight either."	doubts economy President Biden Good past summer months midterm elections Biden administration faced huge problem economy voters vote basis economy feel feel economy recorded two consecutive quarters declining GDP academic observation technical Two quarters Declining GDP Recession making find every economics textbook ever written look used college Biden administration admit admitted recession lose Senate lose control chambers Congress lie lie something easily defined everyone change definition came definition recession look GDP old racist assessing economy Look holistic factors Let look labor market example labor market June Bureau Labor Statistics gave ammunition case Bureau Labor Statistics issued report showed labor market strong determined economy added million jobs second quarter March June million jobs big deal big story Joe Biden wasted touting Watch million jobs second quarter despite negative growth Wait second million jobs negative growth seems magic possible media asked questions Instead repeated White House line BLS report Bureau Labor Statistics report showing million jobs proves recession quote jobs report suggests Biden economy recession wrote York Times stories basis factors control Senate learn truth million jobs Philadelphia Fed decided check numbers found economy add million jobs second quarter Instead net additional jobs 10 000 less 1 job growth administration claimed rounding error minor math mistake supposedly sent man moon math 100 bucks pocket finding 85 claiming 1 000 000 pocket finding 10 000 claiming rich bankrupt lie wrong million jobs construct lie sure BLS numbers help Joe Biden though another purpose fake numbers gave chairman Federal Reserve justification continue raising interest rates basis report raise rates Powell days ago Ooh Every word lie justification lie Powell knows 7 million men age watching Internet day lying effects obvious try take car loan home loan loan loan got adjustable rate watch much paying per month administration wants Powell raise rates offset Joe Biden policies caused huge problem everyone else Raising rates economy faltering jobs keep cause collapse seems put Biden administration got interest rate hike wanted labor market flatlining William Beach runs Bureau Labor Statistics Marty Walsh runs Department Labor need explain anyone ever trust basic economic numbers government issues ever numbers wrong base future policies numbers wrong Jerome Powell probably answer question fairly soon join either	doubt economy President Biden Good past summer month midterm election Biden administration faced huge problem economy voter vote basis economy feel feel economy recorded two consecutive quarter declining GDP academic observation technical Two quarter Declining GDP Recession making find every economics textbook ever written look used college Biden administration admit admitted recession lose Senate lose control chamber Congress lie lie something easily defined everyone change definition came definition recession look GDP old racist assessing economy Look holistic factor Let look labor market example labor market June Bureau Labor Statistics gave ammunition case Bureau Labor Statistics issued report showed labor market strong determined economy added million job second quarter March June million job big deal big story Joe Biden wasted touting Watch million job second quarter despite negative growth Wait second million job negative growth seems magic possible medium asked question Instead repeated White House line BLS report Bureau Labor Statistics report showing million job prof recession quote job report suggests Biden economy recession wrote York Times story basis factor control Senate learn truth million job Philadelphia Fed decided check number found economy add million job second quarter Instead net additional job 10 000 le 1 job growth administration claimed rounding error minor math mistake supposedly sent man moon math 100 buck pocket finding 85 claiming 1 000 000 pocket finding 10 000 claiming rich bankrupt lie wrong million job construct lie sure BLS number help Joe Biden though another purpose fake number gave chairman Federal Reserve justification continue raising interest rate basis report raise rate Powell day ago Ooh Every word lie justification lie Powell know 7 million men age watching Internet day lying effect obvious try take car loan home loan loan loan got adjustable rate watch much paying per month administration want Powell raise rate offset Joe Biden policy caused huge problem everyone else Raising rate economy faltering job keep cause collapse seems put Biden administration got interest rate hike wanted labor market flatlining William Beach run Bureau Labor Statistics Marty Walsh run Department Labor need explain anyone ever trust basic economic number government issue ever number wrong base future policy number wrong Jerome Powell probably answer question fairly soon join either
96	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-border-crisis-invasion-country	2022-12-19 23:07:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Border crisis is an 'invasion of our country' | Fox News	Fox News host Tucker Carlson details how border crisis has impacted El Paso, Texas on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'The contrast between El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico has always been one of the great advertisements for America and for the American way. The cities have a lot in common. They're literally right next to each other. They're separated by one of the narrowest stretches of the Rio Grande River by feet. From downtown El Paso, you can see downtown Juarez, and the populations are not that different.  Most people in  have relatives in Mexico. The difference is one city is American and one is not. El Paso has always been tranquil and orderly, a really nice town with good schools and friendly people. You would move there. Juarez is terrifying, chaotic, impoverished and dangerous. In 2010, Juarez recorded more than 3,000 murders. In El Paso, just yards away, there were five.  On one side of the river, you had a high functioning civilization, ours, and on the other side you had the third world and the success of El Paso said everything about the superiority of the American system and American culture. But two years ago, Joe Biden set out to change that. It was an offense against equity. They were too different, but instead of fixing Juarez, he decided to destroy El Paso and make it much more like Juarez. To do that, the administration opened America's southern border to the world. No place in our country was hit harder by that decision than El Paso, Texas.  In the last year, illegal immigration into El Paso has risen by over 280% – undreds of thousands of foreign nationals streaming in, jobless, penniless, anonymous. What happened next? You know what happened next: the most predictable disaster in the world. Crime skyrocketed. Social cohesion collapsed. Test scores in local schools plummeted, and the city began to fall apart. People who grew up in El Paso started to leave in large numbers. This is what it looks like now:   Imagine if that was your city – your city – where you work and raised your family, the city that you built and then one day some guy gets elected and decides to destroy it and the media ignores it. No one even covers it. Most Americans have no idea your city has been destroyed.And it's not just downtown and the shelters. It's the airport, the window into El Paso. In case you haven't flown there recently, here's what it looks like. People seem to be camping on the floor of the place. Looks like the train station in post partition Calcutta, but at least they had a war to blame it on. There's no war in Texas except the war the White House declared on its own country. This footage comes from Katie Daviscourt of Rebel News and we'll talk to her in a moment. Where are you from?  Peru     That's the airport. They're not waiting for flights. They're living there. And they're not from Mexico or even El Salvador and Guatemala. They're from, as you just heard, Colombia, Peru, the Dominican Republic, an island. These are countries thousands of miles away, to which we owe nothing. There is no reason for this. There are 7 million American men of working age who are not working. They're on the internet all day. They have nothing to do. And yet we're doing this. The mayor of El Paso, Oscar Leeser, has just declared a state of emergency and you can see why.   El Paso wasn't like this just a few years ago. Ask anyone who went there. The question is, why isn't the state of Texas stopping this? Where's the Texas National Guard? A few months ago, Greg Abbott, the governor, was running for office. He was running against Beto O'Rourke, and he was willing to say anything to get re-elected. He was willing to lie and apparently he did. He said he'd deploy 10,000 troops to the border. Oh, but he hasn't. He just revised it to 5,000 troops. And then he came up with another solution: just bus thousands of migrants to other states, which is kind of funny. It makes for an amusing cable news segment. But it's still our country, isn't it? And none of these people are ever leaving.   This is an invasion of our country. We don't have a border and Greg Abbott could stop it, and he isn't. Why isn't the Texas National Guard stopping this? We can't answer that question. We'd love to have Greg Abbott come on and tell us.But because Texas isn't securing the border, the rest of the country is also overrun with people from foreign countries who have no right to be here and whose identity we don't know. At exactly the moment, we do not need a larger population as our economy moves south. This is what Denver, Colorado, a long way from the border looks like now.    That's in Denver. Again, a long way from our southern border. This is the biggest story in recent American history, a total change in the American population, millions and millions and millions of new people. The country will never be what it was five years ago. Even if you're for this, you would acknowledge this is a big deal and it's completely ignored by the media, except when they are forced to respond, and they tell you to shut up and stop complaining. On ABC News, someone called Martha Raddatz argued that actually it's people who are against immigration who are to blame for the immigration crisis because they're talking about it and therefore advertising it to the rest of the world. Watch this.  You do fervently wish say, 25,000 Haitians would move to Martha Raddatz’s neighborhood tonight. Maybe she'd give different coverage. But until that happens, and since they've been deported from Martha's Vineyard in all the places people like Martha Raddatz live, the Democratic Party is well able to continue lying. Here's Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio explaining that really only racists and crazed conspiracy nuts care about the border.   It's amazing. That's Sherrod Brown, supposed populist from Ohio, a guy who cares about the little guy and displaced factory workers and those 7 million working age American men who aren't working and are playing video games and watching porn all day. That's your country. Sherrod Brown was elected because he claimed to care about them. And in fact, it wasn't that long ago that Sherrod Brown was down at the border declaring a humanitarian crisis. People were living in cages, people from other countries.    Now, that same Sherrod Brown says you're not allowed to talk about anything that's happening at the , people camping on streets or at the airport. You also, by the way, can't talk about conditions inside migrant detention centers anymore because they've got a Democratic president Now.  Texas Representative Tony Gonzalez just went to one. He shot the footage you're seeing on your screen now. That's a detention center in El Paso. It was intended to hold about 1,000 people there, now more than 4,000 inside of it. They're about to be let out onto the street of El Paso. Does Sherrod Brown care? What does Martha Raddatz think of this? Again, let's hope every one of these people winds up in their neighborhood. 	details border crisis impacted El Paso Texas contrast El Paso Texas Juarez Mexico always great advertisements cities common

Kinzinger was first elected to the House 12 years ago, and for the bulk of his time in office, he served utterly without distinction, in virtual anonymity. A few of his constituents had heard of him, but none expressed interest in learning more. Then in 2018 came the transformation. That was the year that Adam Kinzinger turned 40 and things began to change inside of him.  The first signs were subtle but unmistakable: choking up at a car insurance commercial, opening an Instagram account and posting pictures of himself, wearing spandex bike shorts to Starbucks without shame and sometimes, with a fanny pack. By 2021, Kinzinger had a full-blown case of male menopause with all the familiar, painful symptoms: mood swings, hot flashes, food cravings, uncontrollable weeping.  A lesser man would have retreated from public life, chosen new pronouns and transitioned in private, but Adam Kinzinger chose another path. He chose to be a role model. He wanted other middle-aged men to know there is life after hormonal imbalance, and so on July 27, 2021, Adam Kinzinger bravely came out of the closet as a weepy man. You may remember the moment.   Imagine the courage that took. ""Yes, I am emotionally incontinent. Yes, I am utterly irrational. No, I will not be silent."" In Washington, Kinzinger's performance was considered deeply inspirational. Here's a man who has no control of himself at all, so we'd better put him in charge of important things. Kinzinger quickly became regarded as an essential voice on foreign policy. When the world hangs in the balance, you want a guy who cries a lot. For his part, Kinzinger demonstrated a remarkable ability to make any situation on the planet, no matter how complex or weighty, all about him: diplomacy by narcissism. Here he was yesterday on the House floor in his final, yes, emotion-laden address.   Yeah, it's just the right thing to do. See, the world actually isn't complicated. In fact, the world is simple. It's like an original, made-for-TV movie on Lifetime, the kind where you burn through two bags of Skinny Pop just trying to keep your tears in check. If  is doing something in a foreign country with guns, by definition, it's ""just the right thing to do,"" like in Syria. Kinzinger's often expressed concern for Syria's men, women and children is what matters and because that concern matters so much, Kinzinger has pushed hard to continue the neocon proxy war in Syria.  Results? Syria now has no economy left and there's a massive cholera outbreak in progress. Men, women and children are dying in huge numbers because it's just the right thing to do. Same in Ukraine. Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally to a Twitter account called ""Catturd"" because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like ""Catturd.""  So, the other day, ""Catturd"" made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors of the Ukrainian flag, colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger and every other empathetic soccer mom in her mid-40s. You can imagine how offensive that was. It was like telling an off-color joke about Meghan Markle. It could not stand — and so alone and battling debilitating hot flashes in this kitchen, fighting the urge to open yet another bag of Chips Ahoy!, Adam Kinzinger fought back. ""Literal evil,"" he wrote in a late-night response to ""Catturd."" ""If I met you in person, it would not end well... for you. Sicko."" Woah, hear, that, ""Catturd""? It will not end well for you. It's not a pillow fight Adam Kinzinger is talking about. That's a full-on slap fight with hair-pulling. This is real. You'd better apologize. Our heart goes out to ""Catturd"" tonight, who is probably cowering in a litter box somewhere, waiting for Adam Kinzinger to show up with sharpened nails. Mock the Ukrainian flag, get scratched. Those are the rules, ""Catturd."" It's a tough town. Meow!  Speaking of how it will all end, how's it going to end for Adam Kinzinger? Well, we suspect it will end like it began, in anonymity. In just weeks, Adam Kinzinger will be another CNN contributor. No one will ever see him again, but we will never forget him.  will live forever in our hearts as an example of what a man can be when he stops trying to be a man and unleashes the emotionally fragile, divorced, single mom within. ""Have another glass of chardonnay. Listen to me cry."" Yes, Ms. Kinzinger, we will. So, here it is one last time:  Au revoir, Adam Kinzinger. See you at SoulCycle. "	says goodbye favorite members Congress Adam Kinzinger take moment goodbye favorite members Congress Mr Kankakee Illinois ladies gentlemen Kinzinger elected House 12 ago bulk

102	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-heres-source-cia-jfks-assassination	2022-12-15 22:41:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Here's what a source said about the CIA and JFK's assassination | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on a source saying the CIA was involved in JFK's assassination on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Not long after Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald on camera in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, a lot of Americans started to have some questions about the . It was, you'd have to admit, a pretty extraordinary sequence of events. A lone gunman murders the president of the United States. And then, less than 48 hours later, that lone gunman is himself murdered by another lone gunman.What are the odds of that? It's one thing if you get struck by lightning – rare but possible. But if every member of your family also gets struck by lightning, all on different days, you might begin to suspect these are not entirely natural events. But oh, replied the U.S. government, they are. This bizarre chain of killings was all entirely natural."" So less than a year after the JFK assassination, the Johnson White House released something called the Warren Commission Report. And the report concluded that while their motives remained unclear, both Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby had acted alone. No one helped them. There was no conspiracy of any kind. Case closed. Time to move on.And many Americans did move on. At the time, they had no idea how shoddy and corrupt the Warren Commission was. It would be nearly 50 years before the CIA admitted under duress that in fact, it had withheld information from investigators about its relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald. But even then, at the time, before that was known, the government's explanation didn't seem entirely plausible. And some people started asking obvious questions about it. It was at that point, as Americans started to doubt the official story, that the term ""conspiracy theory"" entered our lexicon. As Professor Lance DeHaven-Smith points out in his book on the subject, ""The term conspiracy theory did not exist as a phrase in everyday American conversation before 1964. In 1964, the year the Warren Commission issued its report, the New York Times published five stories in which 'conspiracy theory' appeared.""Now, today, of course, the term ""conspiracy theory"" appears in pretty much every New York Times story about American politics. It's wielded, now as then, as a weapon against anyone who asks questions the government doesn't feel like answering. But despite 60 years of name-calling, those questions have not disappeared. In fact, they have multiplied with time.And here's one of them. In April of 1964, a psychiatrist called Louis Joylon West visited Jack Ruby in his isolation cell in a Dallas jail. According to West's written assessment, he found that Jack Ruby was ""technically insane"" and in need of immediate psychiatric hospitalization. Those are conclusions that puzzlingly no one who had spoken to Jack Ruby previously had reached. Ruby had seemed perfectly sane to the people who knew him. Louis Jolyon West pronounced him crazy. But what West did not say was that he was working for the CIA at the time. Louis Jolyon West was a contract psychiatrist for the spy agency. He was also an expert on mind control and a prominent player in the now infamous MKUltra program in which the CIA gave powerful psychiatric drugs to Americans without their knowledge.So of all the psychiatrists in the world, what in the world was this guy doing in Jack Ruby's prison cell? The media did not seem interested in finding out. In fact, the New York Times, in an extensive 1999 obituary of West, never mentioned the fact that he had worked for the CIA, much less his time in Jack Ruby's cell, which seems relevant. So you can see why non-crazy people would wonder about what really happened. And of course, many have wondered. In 1976, long forgotten, the House of Representatives impaneled a special committee to reinvestigate the JFK assassination. Their bipartisan conclusion? Jack Kennedy was almost certainly murdered as the result of a conspiracy. But the question is a conspiracy by whom? Well, the obvious suspect would be the CIA. Why else would the agency withhold critical evidence from investigators? Is there a benign explanation for that, for maintaining this level of secrecy for this many years? Not that we're aware of. And it is illegal. In 1992, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. That act mandated full disclosure of all documents by 2017, 54 years after JFK was killed. The last administration promised to comply fully with that law. But under intense pressure from CIA Director Mike Pompeo, withheld, in the end, thousands of pages of CIA documents.Today, this afternoon, the  did exactly the same thing. That would be thousands of pages of documents after nearly 60 years, after the death of every single person involved. But we still can't see them. Clearly, it's not to protect any person. They're all dead. It's to protect an institution. But why?Well, today we decided to find out. We spoke to someone who had access to these still hidden CIA documents, a person who was deeply familiar with what they contained. We asked this person directly, ""Did the CIA have a hand in the murder of John F. Kennedy, an American President? And here's the reply we received verbatim. Quote, ""The answer is yes. I believe they were involved. It's a whole different country from what we thought it was. It's all fake.""It's hard to imagine a more jarring response than that. Again, this is not a ""conspiracy theorist"" that we spoke to. Not even close. This is someone with direct knowledge of the information that once again is being withheld from the American public. And the answer we received was unequivocal. Yes, the CIA was involved in the assassination of the president. Now, some people will not be surprised to hear that they suspected it all along. But no matter how you feel about it or what you thought about the Kennedy assassination, pause to consider what this means.It means that within the US government, there are forces wholly beyond democratic control. These forces are more powerful than the elected officials that supposedly oversee them. These forces can affect election outcomes. They can even hide their complicity in the murder of an American president. In other words, they can do pretty much anything they want. They constitute a government within a government mocking, by their very existence, the idea of democracy. As cynical as we have become after 30 years of watching government officials ignore the voters who employ them, we were shocked to learn this. It's not acceptable. Americans have trusted their government less with every passing year since the killing of John F. Kennedy. Maybe this is why. And people have known this for a long time. The people who knew would include every director of the CIA since November of 1963. And that list would include Obama's CIA director, , one of the most sinister and dishonest figures in American life. That list would also include, we are sad to say, our friend Mike Pompeo, who ran the CIA in the last administration. Mike Pompeo knew this. We asked Pompeo to join us tonight, and though he rarely turns down a televised interview, he refused to come.

105	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-can-we-learn-happening-california	2022-12-14 22:38:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: What can we learn from what's happening in California? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out cities for punishing people based on skin color on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'In the summer of 2020, mobs of Joe Biden voters destroyed big parts of the . They looted stores. They burned a police station. They murdered people. But they did this, we were informed at the time, in the name of something called racial justice. But then we saw that some of the mob turned out to be privileged White kids, the children of lawyers from Bethesda. But, they said they were rioting on behalf of so-called marginalized communities.They were working for racial justice. And because of that, they couldn't be punished for what they did. Nor, by the way, were they required to wear COVID masks like the rest of us. That's how holy their mission was. They're exempt from the normal laws of civilization. Kamala Harris raised money for them like they were missionaries. You probably remember that.But do you recall what happened next in Minneapolis? That's the part of the story the media had no interest in covering. And they never do. The iron law of liberal social activism is that you never revisit the scenes of your moral victories. You give a speech declaring yourself a good person and you go home. You don't return to Selma or Soweto or Ferguson, Missouri, to see how the people there are doing because it's not about those people. It's about you and your newly enhanced moral authority, which is instantly convertible to political power and cash. Ask Barack Obama.But in the spring of 2021, one reporter decided to break with protocol and go back to Minneapolis a year later. He wanted to see what racial justice had done for the city. His name was Michael Tracey, and as you can imagine, he writes for Substack, not The New York Times. One night, while Tracey was in Minneapolis, a man walked into a Somali-owned convenience store and murdered the clerk. Tracey wanted to know why that happened. So, he started to interview people in the neighborhood and one of them told him this: ""African Americans are hunting Somalis in Minneapolis."" Why is that? Well, because: ""They believe Somalis are getting special favors from the government."" Are you surprised to hear that? You should not be surprised because when government creates a spoils system based on race and ethnicity — and our government certainly has done that — division and violence are the inevitable outcomes. That is true always and everywhere. That fact never changes.And liberals for many decades used to pretend to understand that. That's why they opposed Jim Crow and the Nuremberg Laws. But at some point, and it would be interesting to know precisely when and why, liberals enthusiastically embraced the racial spoils system they once claimed to hate. This is unfolding across the country, but it's especially prevalent in places liberals control. The more power liberals have, the more sweeping and rigid the race-based spoils system they create. In California, of course, they have absolute power, and that's why the government of San Francisco has just announced they will send you money if you have the right skin color.The most vulnerable people in the community. If you're the most vulnerable person in the community, you get $1,000 a month. But that specifically does not include the homeless guy OD'ing in the park on fentanyl if he's White. If he's White, he can die because if he's White, even if he's dying, he's by definition not vulnerable. California now has many programs like this. The state has now proposed a  for the descendants of slaves. It seems simple, but there's a problem with it. How do you know who qualifies for reparations? It's been a long time. It's been more than 150 years since slavery. And Americans have made a lot of babies since then, and many of them are interracial. So at this point, there are plenty of White people in America who are descended from slaves. There are plenty of Black people in America who are descended from slave owners. That's just true. So how do you know who qualifies for government reparations? Well, of course, there's only one way to find out. And it's old-fashioned Nazi race science. Nazi race science. So the state will have to certify the racial purity of its citizens in order to send them money. That's going to have to happen. Do we really want to go there? Do we really want to do that? Amazingly, liberals really do.The city of San Francisco just fired its elections director, a man called John Arntz, because he's White. We're not guessing at that. The president of San Francisco's election commission, Chris Jerdonek, confirmed that was the reasoning. And we're quoting: ""Our decision,"" he said to the man who was fired, ""was not about your performance. But after 20 years, we wanted to take action on the city's racial equity plan and give people an opportunity to compete for a leadership position."" Fired for his skin color. Aren't we against that? Didn't we have a civil rights movement to stop that? And by the way, in this specific case, the guy who got fired, John Arntz, single-handedly ended widespread corruption and incompetence in San Francisco's election. He had the job for two decades. They used to have ballot boxes turning up regularly in the San Francisco Bay. That was fraud. He stopped it. But his skin color was the problem. The shade of his skin was more offensive to liberals in San Francisco than fraudulent elections.Now, there was an outcry over this and Arntz ultimately got his job back. But the city of San Francisco — the government, not just the people, the government — still endorses the idea of punishing people based on their skin color. The city of San Francisco just launched a separate guaranteed income program, this one for ""pregnant Black women."" It pays up to $1,000 a month. And that program got more than $5 million more in state funding, so it's expanding. Now to Los Angeles, Riverside, Contra Costa County, Alameda. The left-wing group Expecting Justice just put together this promo for the program. o that is, every word of it, a racist lie. There's precisely no evidence that structural racism exists in this country against the communities she's talking about, and none whatsoever that it causes higher infant mortality. There's no science whatsoever. That's just, again, a racist lie. But more to the point, nobody who says birthing people should ever be in charge of handing out money to mothers, much less taxpayers' money. But of course, that's happening. And that tells you, well, this is a grift. This is a scam designed to shunt money from people who make it to people who vote for the right party. And that's why Sheila Jackson Lee recently demanded billions of dollars of reparations. Because that, she said, would have been a much better way to deal with COVID.So, she's obviously a fringe character and easy to make fun of. But it wasn't just Sheila Jackson Lee. That was the official position. That was the prevailing view of the Democratic Party in 2020. Vote for us and we'll give reparations based on skin color.So again, it's hard to overstate just how crazy and divisive that is. In order for that to work in practice, you would have to take people's blood and figure out what percentage they were of one race or the other. Maybe measure their heads. You would wind up with Nazi race science, with racial purity tests. And no decent person wants to live in a country where the government does that. It's obviously a dead end and a terrible idea. And it would, of course, promote violence and division. So that's a non-starter when you think about it.But Joe Biden decided he was going to get around a national debate on reparations simply by just doing it, throwing it in the farm bill. Biden, right after he took office, allocated billions of dollars in farm aid based on race — just on race. A judge, thankfully, shut that down. But they didn't slow down in their effort to create a racial spoils system. They don't care about what it does to the country. So  suggested that certain communities, based on their skin color, deserved faster hurricane response. So there's an entire civil rights department at the Justice Department, a division, designed to stop the government from rewarding or punishing people on the basis of skin color. That was the whole point of the civil rights movement. But they're doing nothing. Of course. They're encouraging it because Democrats run the government. So as a result, California has launched yet another basic income program, this time for trans people. Really? How is that going to work? How do you prove you're trans? Can anyone even define what that means? No. But here's San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman bragging about how much taxpayer money London Breed gives to people for being trans.The most vulnerable people. Really? How are we measuring vulnerability when ""The View"" supports and celebrates your existence every single day? When every fashionable person in America posts tributes to you on social media every week, how vulnerable are you? Let's get right to it. Let's measure that by household income. Is the household income of the average trans person in America higher or lower than it is on an Indian reservation? Hmm. Is it higher or lower than it is in rural Iowa?And by the way, what is transgender? On the current application in San Francisco, there are 97 different gender options available, 19 sexual orientations. These would include aromantic, demisexual, d***, pansexual, same-gender loving and skoliosexual. So at this point, probably not going to get California back into the realm of functional and sane. Twenty years from now, that will be a deeply poor state presided over by a small group of incredibly rich people. Every normal person of all colors will have left and moved to Florida. Probably no fixing it at this point. They'll be cutting the redwood forests, selling them for money. You know exactly where this is going. Look at Bolivia. But what can the rest of us, in the other 49 states, learn from what's happening in California? "	calls cities punishing based skin color summer 2020 mobs Joe Biden voters destroyed big parts looted

108	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-americas-real-problems-ignored	2022-12-13 22:32:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: America's real problems are being ignored | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to President Biden signing the Respect for Marriage Act on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Time for a confession, right off the bat. There were times, we will admit it, back in the dark ages of cable news, when we'd milk a single news event for weeks. In some cases, and we're talking to you, O.J. Simpson, for months and months and months. There just wasn't that much going on. So you couldn't afford to waste a good story. That is not the problem we are having these days. The problem now is the opposite of course. There's too much going on and some of it is terrifying. In just the last week, China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Saudi Arabia, our old ally, signaling an end to America's longstanding global petro empire. That's not a small thing. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, who runs Russia, once again threatened to launch a nuclear war on the West. Then Wall Street began laying off large numbers of people, which is not something you can ignore in an industry whose business it is to predict the future of the economy. And at the same time that was happening, the wealth of the average American household dropped to one of the lowest levels ever recorded. The CDC responded by trying to resurrect face masks because that will help.  got arrested. And then the Mexican drug cartels, which run the largest human trafficking operation since the Transatlantic Slave Trade ended, now officially have control of our southern border.So it's been a busy week. In fact, more has happened in this past week than happened during two full terms under Bill Clinton. A lot. So if you're running our country right now, you'd be staying up all night, every night, trying to figure out how to respond. But that's not what the Biden administration is doing. Not at all. This afternoon, as the old global order collapses to be replaced by God knows what, the Biden people decided to hold a drag event at the White House. Just in case you were wondering if those comparisons to Weimar were overstated, no, they're not overstated.The occasion for this celebration was the official signing of the Respect for Marriage Act, which the White House tells us will codify gay marriage into law. But wait a moment, you wonder. Wasn't gay marriage legalized by the Supreme Court way back under Barack Obama? Well, yeah. But they've legalized it again. It's double legal. And you know what that means? That means it's time to hear from Lady Gaga.Dance party at the White House! Hurray! What's been legal for years is still legal. Break out the White Claw. Cyndi Lauper was there, of course, to celebrate. Cyndi Lauper is going to be 70 years old this spring, meaning she's lived in this country a long time. But until today, until this afternoon at the White House, under the beneficent gaze of Joe Biden the Great, Cyndi Lauper informed us that Americans were not allowed to love each other. Until today, love was banned. But Joe Biden changed that. And now we're free to love. Watch this and see if you don't choke up just a little.Wait. Didn't that happen 10 years ago? Well, we checked. That tape is from today. The party was at the White House today. And that means that somewhere, our nuclear disposal friend, Sam Brinton, formerly of the Energy Department, is sitting atop a pile of stolen women's clothes, cursing the fact that airports have security cameras in the baggage claim. Damn those cameras. If only Brinton hadn't been caught, this would have been like Christmas for him. He could have spent the morning in Cyndi Lauper's dressing room trying to purloin a new halter top. Talk about a missed opportunity. Thankfully, Marti Cummings was there to make up for it. Cummings is a drag star who like Sam Brinton, has a long history of unfiltered social media posts. ""F the police,"" Cummings tweeted in 2020. ""Yes, we want to defund the police. Yes, we want to abolish ICE. No, we won't settle for anything less. We'll continue to fight for this to happen."" That sounds like Antifa. Well, yeah. And to prove it, this year, Cummings promoted something called ACAB Coffee, using the all but copyrighted slogan of Antifa.So here you have an Antifa-friendly drag queen dressing up like a woman and promoting violence. Talk about a perfect White House guest. And, of course, Cummings is also interested in children in all the wrong ways. Cummings once tweeted this: ""The kids are out to sing and suck"" to perform fellatio. Oh, okay. Cummings then added, ""Anyone who thinks drag isn't for children is wrong."" Cummings had posted this picture with a child writing, ""He wants to perform with us next year."" So if you think it's unfair to accuse people of being creepy with kids? Not that unfair, actually. Kind of fair. Here is Cummings at a TED Talk in 2019.Yeah. A lot of kids want to be a drag queen. So that's the guy at the White House today, but it's not really an anomaly. It was just a month ago the administration invited a guy called Dylan Mulvaney. That's a grown man who identifies as a walking stereotype of a little girl and he met the President.So what's going on here? Well, multiple things of course. This is an effort to degrade the country, to make it into a joke. These are people striding through the hallways that once were the work area of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and FDR. Whatever you think of their policies, these were serious men who stayed up late every night thinking about how to make the country better. And now there's that guy, and a lot of people like that. And Cyndi Lauper. Celebrating gay marriage, which has been legal since the Obama administration. What is going on here?Well, again, it's an effort to degrade the country. But as a political matter, it's a distraction. Offend you so much or mesmerize you so completely that you forget that there are multiple world historic crises unfolding at the same time, some of which the Biden administration caused, none of which it can solve. That's the point. They have no idea what to do about the collapse of the postwar order, which is on display. Or the continuing slow motion collapse of the American economy, which you feel because you're poorer than you were last year, and they don't have anything to say to you. Even if they cared, they wouldn't have an answer. Here's a drag show. Welcome to Weimar. What happens next? But the point is, you lose any perspective about everything else real that is happening. This is a tactic, and it's not a new tactic. Actually, Joe Biden once recognized this tactic because if nothing else, he knows politics. Here's Biden in 2006 in a clip we were grateful to get, recognizing that complaining about gay marriage, whatever you think of gay marriage, is a pretty handy way for politicians to distract from their own failures. Here's Joe Biden.So he gets a pass because that was pre-dementia. He has no memory of saying any of that. Now he's just a vessel for the ambitions of others. But that was an interesting insight. People talk about stuff like this, particularly when it's not, strictly speaking, ""relevant"" because they don't want to talk about other things. And that makes it even more interesting that Joe Biden's handlers, 16 years later, are telling him to talk about gay marriage and drag shows. Anything to distract you. And in fact, at today's bill signing, just to completely pull your attention away from everything else that's going on, Joe Biden came out in favor of gay marriage -- of course, because it's been legal for 10 years -- and in favor of the genital mutilation of children. Here he is.It's pretty interesting when you think about it. So this is a bill signing, affirming the legality – legalizing once again, gay marriage, which most people support in this country. Should people be able to get married if they love each other? Yeah, they should. That's fine. Not that controversial a point at this stage. But here's Joe Biden using that opportunity to  for kids. And of course, that means the sexual mutilation of children, cutting the breasts off 15-year olds, sterilizing them for life with chemicals. That's what Boston Children's Hospital and many other hospitals have been doing. Puberty blockers. Have fun with osteoporosis when you're 30. So why would Joe Biden be promoting that apart from the fact certain special interest groups want him to? Again, this was supposed to be about gay marriage. But here you have Joe Biden, President of the United States, purportedly pushing child sexual mutilation. And then you have -- this is even weirder -- Kamala Harris out there talking about contraception. Really? Watch. Now we're just confused. The right to buy contraception now. No one on this show is a legal scholar. But Griswold v. Connecticut came down in 1967, which affirmed, from the high court, the right of Americans to buy contraception. That was 56 years ago. Interracial marriage? Hmm, that's been legal for our lifetimes. No one's trying to make it illegal. Not one person is pushing to make that illegal. Not one. So here you have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris affirming your right to buy the pill and marry someone of a different race, even though neither right is under attack by anyone. Why are they doing this? Well, it's of apiece with their agenda recently. Remember, this is the same party that pushed through an anti-lynching bill this year. Lynching! Was that on the list of major problems? Are there lynchings going on? Wasn't that already illegal? ""No, we just banned it for the first time."" Watch.After all these years? There are a lot of people who are for lynching, but we held off the pro-lynching lobby, and we got this through the Congress. We've improved your life. Really? Where are all these lynchings? Where all these racial acts of terror committed by White supremacists? Search the Internet for them. You will see some racial acts of terror. Hard to find a lot committed by White supremacists. Any maybe. Where are the numbers on that? How many racial attacks by White supremacists have there been in the last couple of years? Maybe there've been a lot. We're not familiar with that. We're not aware that that actually happened. Pretty sure it didn't actually happen. We do know that nooses have appeared in various places. Do you remember that? There was one at the construction site of Barack Obama's new presidential library? Maybe that's what they're talking about. They offered a six-figure award to catch the person who tied rope in a forbidden shape, but no culprit was ever found. How weird. Then there was that noose in the NASCAR garage. Then there was a noose around Jesse Smollett's neck. Is that the lynching they're banning?The funny thing is, you know that's not real. And most people know it's not real. Why are they continuing to say this? Well, because as actual problems, real problems mount, and they have no answer and no solution, and they're trying to dodge culpability for creating those problems in the first place, they have to doubledown on fake problems. We're banning lynching. And no one laughed? There's not one person who's for lynching. Bill Melugin and his team, speaking of real problems, just shot this new video of massive crowds of foreign nationals invading our country. Sorry, that's just true. Most of them are not from Mexico. They're from very, very far away across the oceans. And now they're in a Mexican border town across from Brownsville, Texas. And they're waiting there for  in eight days. And when that happens, when the Biden administration drops that last piece of legal defense against invasion, it's going to be an overwhelming wave, of course. Maybe that's why they're bringing drag stars and Cyndi Lauper to the White House. Because they don't want to talk about, I don't know, the threat of nuclear war from Vladimir Putin? So we're now at war -- a hot war, not a proxy war -- a hot war with Russia. American military personnel, lots of U.S. government employees are in Ukraine fighting that war with American weapons that you paid for. And the guy we're at war with just threatened to use nuclear weapons against us. Now, whatever you think of that war, that's not a story? That's not bigger than banning lynching or legalizing gay marriage again, when it was already legal or legalizing contraception, which has been legal since 1967 or interracial marriage. What? Talk about a head fake. Who's falling for this?

111	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-climate-activists-fraudulent	2022-12-12 22:47:00-05:00	TUCKER CARLSON: These climate activists are fraudulent | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out hypocrisy of climate change activists taking private jets on Tucker Carlson Tonight.'We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of the , if you can even believe it. It seems like a day.  has been there almost the whole time. He was sworn in, in early February of 2021. And when he was, he had high hopes. We looked at the tape today. Though he had no previous experience with transportation, or for that matter, with secretarial work, Buttigieg held up his right hand and swore an oath to Kamala Harris to be the best darn Secretary of Transportation he could be. And he seemed to mean it, but not for long. Sadly, history soon intervened. Just weeks into the job, Buttigieg discovered that some of the roads he was supposed to be overseeing, the roads he was now secretary of, were in fact racist and not just ""low grade, got drunk and wrote insensitive Facebook post ten years ago"" racist. Not that kind of racism. No. These were hardcore, David Duke-level, nasty old segregationist roads. These were roads that refused to respond to reason and clearly had no intention of changing. And during the 21st century. Some of these roads literally had white stripes painted on them. White stripes. Jim Crow stuff.Buttigieg seemed shocked by the whole thing. They don't have roads like that back in South Bend, Indiana. So for Pete Buttigieg, it was a pivot point. It was one of those moments of profound disillusionment so common to high-minded, young newcomers to Washington, where everything changes in an instant. All your preconceptions washed away. Here he'd sworn an oath to take care of the roads, but learned the hard way that some roads are beyond repair. They are too racist to fix. So Pete Buttigieg embarked on another path. He became one of America's foremost religious leaders. As an Episcopalian, it was not an easy transition. Traditionally, members of the clergy believe in God. But Buttigieg had a characteristically clever solution, an approach he had learned during his years as a McKinsey consultant. In place of the concept of an omnipotent, loving God who brings justice to the world, Buttigieg simply substituted the word ""climate."" Thanks be to climate. ""Our climate who weren't in heaven"" –  that kind of thing. And it sounded pretty good. Here's one of his sermons:So this was really a milestone in modern Christian theology. Climate, declared Father Buttigieg, is a moral issue. Not a meteorological matter, not even a policy topic. It's a moral issue. Climate is a question that bears directly on the fate of your immortal soul. When you mistreat the climate, you risk damnation. In so much as you have done to the least of these, you have done it to the climate. Big change. You thought it was about the science? Actually, it's about morality. Okay, Reverend Pete. So you set the terms here. So how's your climate record? That seems like a fair question, given that you've just told us that we will go to hell for our carbon emissions. So let's see how you're doing. Fox News Digital just got a hold of the Reverend Pete's travel schedule, a list of trips he's taken since getting the job at the Transportation Department. And it turns out that Reverend Pete is the Jimmy Swaggart of climate clergy. He was commanding you not to do it the same time he was doing it himself in a very big way, way more than you ever thought of doing it.Reverend Pete has sinned. Oh boy, has he in a dark and very naughty way. In less than two years, Buttigieg has flown private, at taxpayer expense, nearly 20 times. He's jetted to Ohio and Florida and New Hampshire, among other places. In September, Buttigieg took an FAA jet to a Canadian gay rights ceremony to accept an award for his LGBTQ+ advocacy. Something else he's been doing since he gave up on the roads.All this has been extremely expensive for you and every other taxpayer. You may recall that Donald Trump's HHS secretary, Tom Price, lost his job for doing exactly the same thing. An outrage – Politico.com drove him out of office. So it's expensive. But that's not the real crime. The real crime here is against the climate. It's a sin. It's a moral transgression because none of these planes that Pete Buttigieg was jetting around on were solar-powered. Not a single one ran on a windmill or recycled French fry oil. They were all fossil fueled. All of them. And there is likely no mode of transportation in the history of machines that emits more carbon than private air travel. That would include long trips across India on coal-fired locomotives.Private jet travel stands alone. Private jets emit an average of two tons of carbon dioxide in an hour. Per hour. For perspective, that's 14 times more carbon emissions per passenger than the JetBlue flight you're on, or any other commercial flight. So you might as well start a tire fire to heat your house. That would be better for the atmosphere than what . Traveling by private jet is literally the last thing that Father Pete should ever do. But we shouldn't be surprised that he's doing it. You may remember that last year, when Pete Buttigieg was busted commuting in a carbon belching SUV, one of the vehicles that destroys the climate, then unloading a bicycle from the back seat for a short, widely photographed ride to the White House. You're seeing that footage on your screen now. Now, that should have been the very first tip that Reverend Pete's sermons and the self-described climate activists who applauded those sermons are all entirely fraudulent.And in fact, they are fraudulent. Roughly half of all emission created by airplanes are emitted by the richest 1% of the population flying private. The great majority of these, Biden voters and big fans of, you guessed it, the Reverend Pete Buttigieg. This year alone, to pick but one among many examples, Steven Spielberg, who said he's ""terrified"" of climate change, emitted over 4400 metric tons of carbon from private jets. How much is that? That's 600 times more emissions than the average person emits in a year. Another climate activist, Taylor Swift, nearly doubled Steven Spielberg's total. 8000 metric tons of CO2 in a year, all of them destroying the planet, rising the seas on a fence against Mother Earth. Now, Taylor Swift justified it by saying, ""Oh, I loan out jet sometimes. Oh, it's okay."" But it's not okay. Not if you claim to believe in climate change.A 50-minute flight on a private jet can emit as much carbon as the average person's car does over an entire year. 50 minutes. So imagine what a flight from D.C. to L.A.X. does, or more likely from Hamptons to Aspen. And then imagine thousands and thousands, tens of thousands, of these flights, all carrying people who claim they believe that climate change is, quote, ""existential."" It's not a mistake. It's intentional. It's a statement and it's quite a statement if you think about it. If you're yapping about carbon emissions and climate and then flying private, what you're really doing is hoisting a screaming middle finger to the country, to the plebs below in their SUVs, which you say you plan to ban. And not just in this country. We've got it easy. The economies of entire nations around the world are being destroyed right now in the name of fighting climate change, at the behest of people who fly private. So people are going hungry and freezing to death around the world so that Pete Buttigieg and his friends won't have to walk through the magnetometer at the TSA checkpoint. I don't mean to single out the Reverend Pete. Though he is certainly the most self-righteous of the group. They're all doing it. Is there a single high level climate activist who doesn't fly private? At the recent climate summit, more than 400 attendees flew in privately, not on JetBlue, in their own planes. Jeff Bezos is one of them. He flew in his private jet. So did Boris Johnson. John Kerry was famously busted flying to a climate summit in Iceland on his personal Gulfstream. But don't worry, he had no choice. He's too important. Watch.Oh, someone like me. You never heard of Zoom, pal? You should be in jail by your own standards. You're a climate criminal. You're a climate criminal. You should be in prison by your own standards. Not just him. Virtually every recognizable person in American politics and entertainment flies private. Nancy Pelosi flies private. Barack Obama flies private. Leonardo DiCaprio flies private. You know who flies private a lot? Al Gore flies private. Michael Bloomberg. Boy, does he fly private. In a four-year period, the U.N. climate envoy, Mr. Bloomberg, took more than 1700 private flights, burning more than 10,000 metric tons of CO2. You could never do that. If you filled your yard with diesel engines and never turned them off, you would not do that. Your car emits less than five metric tons of CO2 a year. So this is meaningful. This is an actual offense against Mother Earth and the climate.So you have to wonder what the defenders of climate think of this. What about the climate warriors at Greenpeace and the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund? Have they noticed this? Not really. Have they scolded their donors for undermining their core message? No, of course not. Katherine Clark, the incoming Democratic Party House Whip, doesn't complain either. She should be because her own child  about climate change.Okay, so you terrorized your own children. You scared the crap out of little kids about climate. So you must be very upset about what Pete Buttigieg is doing to climate by flying private, which is the most destructive thing you can do to climate other than signing off on the sabotage of a Russian natural gas pipeline, which I guess they also did. But who's noticing? But she's not worried about it. Katherine Clark doesn't care and neither do her donors, including the environmental activists who send her all that money. Meanwhile, a lot of young people are very upset about climate. They believe Pete Buttigieg. And you know what they're doing? They're destroying some of the greatest artwork in Western civilization because they want you to know how important the climate is. So, groups like that, those thugs, those monsters, the Stalinist mobs, didn't appear out of nowhere. It's not organic, of course. They were whipped into a frenzy by John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi and Pete Buttigieg. Those were their inspiration. But what's interesting is they're  that are most valuable in our society. Our art, the legacy of our civilization. But you know what they haven't done? They haven't said a single word about Al Gore's personal Gulfstream or John Kerry's or Pete Buttigieg. Well, that's weird, isn't it? They're attacking our civilization's art, but they're not saying anything about the people who are actually destroying the climate.And, you know who else isn't? BlackRock. The ESG score that you keep hearing about? Your flights on private planes have no effect on an ESG score. Really? The ""E"" is for environment, but BlackRock doesn't say a word. Could it be that the climate movement isn't really about the climate or about the environment? Could it be that the climate movement is really about creating a permanent caste system where the people at the top of society, the Brahmins, can do literally whatever they want? Can violate with impunity the standards they impose on others, while endlessly lecturing and oppressing the population that supposedly runs the country, but of course, actually doesn't. Could it be? Oh, it's possible.We called Pete Buttigieg's office today and asked how you can justify flying private as the Earth warms and the seas rise. How are you not a climate criminal? Speak slowly so we can understand. Of course, they didn't explain. But the rest of us should impose this as a litmus test going forward. No one who seeks to impose carbon rationing on another human being should ever be allowed to step within 100 yards of a private aircraft. Period. Anyone who claims to be serious about fighting climate change should demand tomorrow morning a federal law against private air travel. Make it illegal. It's that simple. Then, go ahead and fly commercial with everyone else or stay home. What's the argument against that? Well, here's what you do know. Anyone who lectures you about climate and opposes banning private air travel is a total fraud and should be ignored."	calls hypocrisy climate change activists taking private jets coming two

So you remember when Russia invaded Ukraine in February? And at that time, our leaders told us this wasn't some faraway conflict in Eastern Europe. This was our war. ""No military should ever be allowed to invade a sovereign nation,"" they told us. Iraq and Afghanistan obviously not included in that rule. The invasion of Ukraine could not stand because it was a matter of first principles. But more than that, it was a world historic moral battle that we were obligated to join.It was very clear.  was pure evil. He was Hitler reborn. The Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, was his mirror image. He was saint-like – self-denying, brave, honest, very handsome. And Zelenskyy was fighting for the very same ideals that our country was founded on. A number of news outlets, including CNN and the L.A. Times, compared him to George Washington. So they told us that with one voice month after month, no disagreement allowed. Not surprisingly, it worked. Americans fell hard for President Zelenskyy.They all did. Even in rural areas that voted against Joe Biden, you saw Ukrainian flags hanging from mailboxes. To many people, it felt like World War II again. The good war. A battle against tyranny abroad for the sake of freedom and democracy at home. Well, the better part of a year later, it's getting harder and harder to believe any of this. Whatever you think of the war in Ukraine, it is pretty clear that Zelenskyy has no interest in freedom and democracy. In fact, Zelenskyy is far closer to Lenin than to George Washington. He is a dictator. He is a dangerous authoritarian who has used a hundred billion in U.S. tax dollars to erect a one-party police state in Ukraine. And that's not an overstatement.Over the past two years, Zelenskyy has banned opposition parties. He's shut down critical media by force. He's arrested his political opponents. He has sent soldiers into churches. Zelenskyy's secret police have raided monasteries across Ukraine, even a convent full of nuns, and arrested dozens of priests for no justifiable reason whatsoever and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution, which no longer matters. And in the face of this, the Biden administration has said nothing. Not one word. Instead, they just continue to push to send Zelenskyy more tax dollars. So naturally, Zelenskyy has become much bolder. Why wouldn't he?Last week, he announced his plan to ban an entire religion, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and to seize its property, all for being insufficiently loyal to his regime. And he said it out loud. Watch this.A free country does not  just because it's not fully on board with the political program of the people running the country. But Zelenskyy is doing that and his cabinet is now devising ways to punish Christians for practicing their banned ancient religion in Ukraine. Quote, ""Personal economic and restrictive sanctions will be applied to any Christian caught worshiping in unapproved ways."" Now, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is more than a thousand years old. With the full backing of the Joe Biden administration and the US Congress, Zelenskyy has decided to ban it. So here's the response of one bishop to the news.  You're not allowed to send soldiers into churches. You're not allowed to arrest dozens of priests because they refuse to bow before you. You're not allowed to ban whole religions. So most of the US media, most have just ignored this. Some have made excuses for it. ""Oh, he has to do this because there is a war."" But there's no justification for this whatsoever. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is not Russian, it's Ukrainian. It has no connection to the Putin government. It has, in fact, officially denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So once again, there is no justification for destroying and banning this church. And yet Zelenskyy's many celebrity backers in the West have said nothing about it, and they should know better.In May, George W. Bush, the great defender of Christendom, met with Zelenskyy on a Zoom call and afterward, described him as ""the Winston Churchill of our time."" A man who should be praised for his, quote, ""commitment to liberty."" So where's George W. Bush on this question now that his friend, the George Washington of Ukraine, has banned a form of Christianity in that country? Well, George W. Bush has been silent as well. So have many purportedly Christian members of Congress. They're backing Zelenskyy, no matter how many Christians he arrests, no matter how many churches he seizes.     Every single person you just watched has campaigned. Many of them make a habit of campaigning, , ladies and gentlemen, in Christian churches in the United States. Will a single Christian leader say anything to them about this? You are funding the destruction of Christianity in Ukraine. ""Oh, but it's the cause of freedom."" Really? The reality is that Ukrainians cannot listen to media outlets that criticize the Zelenskyy government because they've been banned. They cannot play music from Russian singers. No, this is not in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. This is in the democracy of Ukraine that we support. They can't play music from Russian singers. They can't vote for an opposition party because they've all been shut down. And now their churches are being raided and their priests arrested.So the fact that our leaders are calling this freedom tells you a lot about what they're planning here. Of course. Why would you defend this? Because you approve of it. For its part, Ukraine's defense ministry has stopped pretending this is about freedom. They're just happy they're getting paid and they're finally crushing any opposition in their own country. And that's why Ukraine's military is now using your tax dollars to produce choreographed dance videos for social media consumption. Sort of like the COVID nurses. Here's one of them.It's just a grotesque postmodern psyop, and anyone who's fallen for this is brain damaged. This is the same Ukrainian defense ministry that lied about the ""Ghost of Kiev"" and the sailors who cursed out the Russian ship. Now they're just having fun. Because they're beating the real enemies, which of course, as always, are domestic. And Time Magazine is fully on board with this. They just informed their four remaining readers that Zelenskyy is the ""person of the year."" And the media chorus is in full scream. Jon Meacham, the purported historian at MSNBC, believes that Zelenskyy is really a lot like the Pope. Great leaders. So if they'll defend a man who shut down opposition media, arrested his political opponents, arrested priests, sent the army into monasteries and then banned a religion, if they'll defend all of that and call it liberty, they'll defend anything."	gives take Russia Ukraine conflict Good remember Russia invaded Ukraine February leaders faraway conflict Eastern Europe war military ever allowed invade

You always imagine when things change radically, they're going to be troops in the streets, and you're going to know this is the pivot point, this is the revolution. But that's most of the time not what actually happens. Usually there's some guy in a suit and tie speaking soothing words, and you don't even know that everything is changing when it is.That's the case with what happened on June 15, 2012, a decade ago. On that day,  walked into the Rose Garden and announced, full of self-confidence and coolness. Obama announced that his administration decided actually not to deport millions of . Henceforth, Barack Obama explained, these millions of people would no longer be identified, in fact, as ""illegal aliens"" or even breakers of federal law, which everyone had assumed they were. No. Going forward, they would be called ""Dreamers."" So illegal aliens are bad, of course, but Dreamers are good.And because to control language is to control reality, these  would no longer be subject to federal law. They'd be above federal law because you can't ban a dream. That's effectively the case that Obama made. Now, what Obama did that day was, strictly speaking, illegal. Several courts later ruled that it's illegal, obviously. Only kings and legislatures get to change the law. American presidents do not have that power and never have. But no one stopped Barack Obama from doing this, so he did it anyway. And the effect, the intended effect, was immediate. Foreign nationals flooded into the United States.Over the decade before Obama's Dreamer Rose Garden announcement, about 8000 unaccompanied minors showed up at the U.S. border every year. After Obama redefined lawbreakers as Dreamers, more than 24,000 showed up. And that's accelerated. Under Joe Biden, the number has grown to 130,000 per year. Now, it's interesting where these people are coming from. They're not coming from a contiguous nation, Mexico. No. They're coming from much farther away. According to the numbers from HHS, 32% of unaccompanied migrants you're seeing are from Honduras. 47% are from Guatemala. Look at a map. 13% are from El Salvador. Those are far away. Those are in Central America. Just 1% are coming from Mexico.What's going on here exactly? Well, mostly, they are teenagers. The overwhelming majority are over the age of 14. They're not little kids. And again, this is accelerating. And it didn't stop during the last administration. The Trump administration didn't stop it. Under immediate pressure, that administration agreed to end so-called family separations at the border. Really, they're inhumane. But the fact is, family separations happen all the time to American citizens. If you commit a crime, you're going to be separated from your kids. And NBC News won't care at all, much less report it. But illegal aliens, Dreamers, shouldn't be forced to face these consequences, explained The New York Times. So now they're not forced to because they're Dreamers. So naturally, the surge continued.But why? Why? Typically a country calculates its immigration levels based on its internal needs. So all throughout American history, there have been periods where, ""Oh, we need people to do this or that. Let's import those people."" But based on the state of the US economy in 2022, these are not the people you would import if you cared about your country. Almost none of the arrivals have a meaningful education. They're not trained to participate in the emerging economy you hear so much about STEM. It plays no role in this. There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration. And of course, immigration destabilizes your society. It makes it far less cohesive. That's always true. It doesn't matter where they're coming from. If you have a ton of new people, you're less cohesive.So why are they coming? There's only one reason. Because the Democratic Party wants new voters, period. That's not a racist conspiracy. No, it's not. It's true. And we know that it's true not because we heard on Alex Jones, but because leading Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years. And here's the latest example. Here is , the head Democrat in the US Senate last month.Everything about that was a lie. We need workers. Really? They're what, 7 million American-born men who have dropped out of the workforce, workforce age, who just aren't working or on the Internet all day? Does anyone care? No. Just replace them. Americans aren't reproducing. Really? Why? Well, because the economy has changed. And what's their answer to that? The Democratic Party's answer. Well the Treasury Secretary told us a month and a half ago. She said, ""If you're worried about the economy, have an abortion."" People who want to have kids increasingly can't. Why is that? Well, because the food supply and the air and water have been poisoned and sperm counts are half what they were a few decades ago. So these are specific problems that have prevented millions of Americans from having families from reproducing, as Chuck Schumer just said. And you could fix them if you tried. But they're not trying. Instead, the solution is to replace the people who aren't reproducing with millions of new people from other countries. That's not a racist conspiracy theory. Chuck Schumer just said it. However many undocumented there are here, Schumer added. So as a political matter, what is this? Well, you're hearing a lot about threats to democracy. This is an actual threat to democracy. This is an actual effort to disenfranchize American voters. It's an attempt to replace their vote with a new electorate. So this is incredibly dark, and it's not a referendum on the people coming here, most of whom are well, they want to be here. So that says something good about them. No. This is a measure of the intent of the people in charge, the malice behind what they're doing. So it's hard to believe this could become law. This could be codified since Republicans just took over the House. Oh, but it could be in the lame duck session, which does not represent the recently expressed will of voters last month. A month ago, voters cast their ballots and they said we would like a Republican House and they got one. But that's all about to be short-circuited.New reporting suggests that Democrats and several Republicans are working on a deal to pass mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens before the new Congress can be seated. Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House Speaker, has promised not to hold a vote for any immigration bill until the border is secure because it would be insane to do otherwise. And yet, several Republican members of the Senate are trying to pass a mass amnesty before the new Republican Congress is seated next month. Leading that effort, he should become famous for this, is Thom Tillis, the Republican senator of North Carolina, joined by Democrat Kirsten Sinema of Arizona. According to Axios, between 10 and 12 Republican senators could join this plan, and that would include names you're probably familiar with: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah. And as we said, Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Then several retiring senators -- Rob Portman, Roy Blunt, Richard Burr -- are also being courted to support the bill.Imagine, someone who's on his way out of Congress, in days, will be codifying a law that will change the country forever. So how are they justifying this? Well, clearly, their donors want it right, because cheap labor is always the justification for everything. It's a shortsighted view. Thom Tillis is saying this is okay because it will only offer amnesty to the Dreamers, Barack Obama's Dreamers. Illegal migrants supposedly came to this country as young people. So by offering  to Dreamers, what will happen next? Well, what happened last time? The U.S. Congress will incentivize more foreign nationals to flood into the country. And that's the whole point of it. It's why Obama did it a decade ago.So what will happen to our economy, which is on the verge of a real downturn? Everyone knows that. Well, let's see. The average Dreamer is 28-years old. The average income, the median income of Dreamers is $26,000. That's far lower than the median income of Americans. So that's not an attack on anybody. It's only a simple observation. If the country is getting poorer, you probably don't want a lot more poverty imported. Again, why is that untrue? Well, it is true, and everyone knows it's true. And no one has the brass to say it out loud. But it's real. By the way, we have no idea how many dreamers or other illegal aliens are in this country. The Biden administration has been working with the government of Mexico to hide those numbers for two years now from the public. Well, so much for democracy. The Center for Immigration Studies just exposed this in one of the most important investigations from the border in a long time. Watch. So that was -- what's the word for that -- oh, that would be immigration fraud being committed by the Biden administration. Hiding the numbers so you don't realize how many people are coming into your country illegally. You have no role in this whatsoever. Now, keep that in mind when you learn that the Thom Tillis lame duck bill will include, quote, ""$25 to $40 billion for border security."" That's actually a lot. Not as much as we're giving to Ukraine because, of course, their borders a lot more important than ours. Shut up, racist. But it is billions more than Donald Trump asked for to build the border wall. And at the time, senators in both parties said that was just way too expensive and racist and people will just build taller ladders. Okay. But now the same group is fine with 40 billion for border security.Why is that? Because they know it's fake. They know it's fake. You can build any structure you want. But if the officials manning the gates, like on January 6, just open the doors, it's meaningless. And of course, Thom Tillis knows that to his eternal shame. How out of it is Thom Tillis? Well, watch Thom Tillis, who clearly has no grounding in the physical reality of America 2022, tell you that letting all these people in giving them citizenship is a good idea because really what we're importing is computer scientists and engineers. Watch Thom Tillis. So that's just a word salad of phrases Thom Tillis doesn't understand, of course. But think about that. In the last two years, thanks to COVID and the manufactured response to it in this country, our public education system has completely collapsed. Kids are not being educated. We're not producing programmers, partly because of policies that Thom Tillis stood by and allowed to be enacted under COVID. But rather than fix that, we need to legalize millions of Dreamers and give them citizenship. So if you really want a lot of computer programs -- there are a lot of them around the world -- you would make an active attempt to identify them and import them, and then you could tell us why. But to let in people without high school educations, by the millions, because we need more computer programmers now you're just lying to us, Thom Tillis. How stupid do you think we are? Pretty stupid, apparently. So what's the border actually look like? Well, Charlie Leduff, our reporter friend from Michigan, formerly The New York Times, has been to the border recently. Spent a lot of time there, caught a lot on video. Here's some footage that tells you who's actually coming over.   So most Americans, because this is a pretty big country, have no idea the scale of this. It has been going on for two years and it will completely change this country forever. And it's continuing and nobody is doing anything about it and no one seems upset about it. Is Thom Tillis upset about this? No, computer programmers. Reading his stupid libertarian talking points from 1996. We're going to have a lot more footage from Charlie Leduff from the border, and it shows you what's actually happening there. A lot of people crossing are nice people with families who just want to work and hang drywall and that's great and everyone supports that. Quite a few of them, though, are drug smugglers. Actually, that's true. This is all being orchestrated by cartels and some of them wind up killing Americans. So the closer you get to the border and this is true of Republicans, Democrats, Hispanics, whites, Blacks, none of that matters. Any American as close to the  is horrified by what's going on there. So the only way that you could support this is by intentionally ignoring what's happening there, like Thom Tillis is and Lisa Murkowski and , all the rest. Today, our Peter Doocy asked Biden, he's going to be in the area soon, ""Are you going to go see the border while you're down there?"" Watch this.There are more important things going on, right? What's actually happening is the Biden administration ended the policies that would have stopped this flood of unaccompanied minors at the border. And now they want to make the problem even worse. And they're doing it for a reason. They're telling you what the reason is. You're not allowed to notice, but it doesn't make it any less true. This is real. This is happening. No one's stopping it. Republicans are colluding to allow it to continue."	reacts possible mass amnesty immigration deal ahead Congress says leaders committing immigration fraud funny profound change always imagine things

Now, traditionally, it's the job of the White House physician to update the public on significant changes to the president's health, but in a striking and honestly poignant break with protocol, Joe Biden decided to drop the bracing news himself. Here he is:I have cancer, Joe Biden said, and I got it from growing up in Delaware. And with that, Biden left the stage, taking no questions about his condition. What kind of cancer does Joe Biden have? What is his long-term prognosis and is Delaware really that bad? Parts of it are not beautiful. That is true, but can an entire state be a carcinogen? At this point, we can't say.  We are hearing word tonight that Biden may have misspoken and rattled no doubt by the stress of his diagnosis. It is likely that, in fact, it's not cancer Joe Biden is battling, but dementia. Simple mistake. We'll get an update from our own in-house physician, Dr. Marc Siegel, in just a moment. But first, no matter what is wrong with Joe Biden, something clearly is, it has not prevented him from working to amass more power than any American president has ever had.   Joe Biden approaches power the way J.B. Pritzker approaches the waffle station at a Shoney's breakfast bar, with maximum enthusiasm. He snorts and slurps and splashes it on his shirt. He can't get enough. Joe Biden's latest idea is that he personally is the only branch of government in the United States. No more separation of powers. Joe Biden has all the power. If the Congress, the Supreme Court does something that Joe Biden doesn't like, he gets to simply ignore it and then do what he wants to do and he can do this because it's an emergency.  There's no time for democracy. We've got an emergency on our hands and naturally, only Joe Biden can solve it. We don't have enough abortions. It's an emergency. You're not wearing a mask alone in your car. It's an emergency. Your kids aren't trans yet. It's an emergency and of course, the emergency to top all emergencies, the climate crisis, which is a kind of ongoing thousand-year emergency, and for that reason, very much existential, whatever that means, but trust us, it is bad and the only solution to it is to hand Joe Biden more power. At an event today, Biden explained the details. Since Congress has officially rejected his attempt to take over our country's energy grid and plunge America into well-deserved darkness, Joe Biden will have to do it himself unilaterally. Now, how is that constitutional, may I ask? Come on. You know the answer, ""because it's an emergency, dummy."" It turns out that because Congress rejected Joe Biden's bill and also because Fox News exists, Americans are dying by the millions from bad weather, which apparently this planet has never seen before, because actually the glaciers were not real. They never happened. That's an Alex Jones thing. What is real is existential climate change. Thankfully, Joe Biden is going to save you from it. Watch.   Now, he slurred the words maybe because, as we told you, he has cancer, but if you listen carefully, you heard today that because of climate change for the first time in history, it's going to be hot and then it's going to rain hard. You did that, Republicans, with your two stroke chainsaws and your damn Ford F-150. Shame, shame, shame. It's like you didn't know it was going to happen. It's not like you weren't warned. Back in 1989, a senior official at the United Nations told the world that ""entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000."" So, you knew when you did it, when you got your Suburban. Look what happened now. Those were once thriving beach towns. Now they're dive sites. People are snorkeling over Malibu, looking down at Prince Harry's house. Here's one of Barack Obama's beachfront compounds. As you can see, it's now underwater.But wait, it's not underwater. Actually, it's fine and Obama knew it would be fine. In fact, Obama spent more than $10 million to buy it and that tells you how much he believes in global warming. Not at all, it turns out.    Actually, no one really believes in global warming and that's why all the liberals in the United States live on the coasts, because they don't believe it. That's why many of them fly private, because the entire theory is absurd and they know it. So, be more like a dog. Ignore what they say. Watch what they do. Watch the real estate they buy. See if you can find Al Gore flying commercial ever. You can't because the whole thing is a joke, but that doesn't mean it can't hurt people. Oh, it definitely can and it definitely has. Gasoline is now unaffordable for millions of Americans. That's a life destroyer. That affects everything in the country. When the price of fossil fuels rise, so does the price of everything else. That's a life destroyer and it's not accidental. The administration did this on purpose, and now they're gloating about it. They're rubbing it in your face. Can't afford to drive your truck anymore?"", sneers our transportation secretary Mayor Pete,"" Then it looks like you're going to have to buy a little electric car. Sorry.  Electric vehicles? So, what is an electric vehicle? What do those little electric cars have to do with climate change? Well, that's a good question. Turns out there is a connection. . Oh, did you know that? Did you know that you can't charge an electric car with a wind farm? How do you charge them? You charge them with fossil fuels. That's also how you build them – with fossil fuels. It's pretty funny. Last month, a GM spokesperson, along with an executive from a Michigan utility, kind of let the secret out. Watch this.          Someday, let's hope historians find that tape and then just savor it, get a beer, get a whole six pack and watch it again and again and again. The spokes chick from the car company was asked, ""Impressed by your battery, but how do you charge it?"" She goes ""from the building. Charge comes from the building. You just plug it into the socket."" But where does the electricity come from?  She has no idea. ""We have a battery. There is a battery in here. It's a battery."" So, then they ask the utility guy, where's electricity come from? Oh, from a coal plant. So, you charge your little electric car that Mayor Pete wants you to buy with coal, and then you feel virtuous. So, really, if you think about it, it's no wonder they tell you that the science is settled and you're a denier, you're immoral if you have questions because there's really no defending the details, most of which, as you just saw, they don't understand. How does the electric car get charged? Oh, from the building, which is not a power plant, for the record. It's just a building with an outlet.So today, Joe Biden didn't answer any questions about where the energy is coming from. In fact, he told us there's no time for debate because it's an emergency.   ""Let me slur it again. Sorry, I've got cancer. Code red for humanity.""And actually, he's right, but not in the way that he intends. If Biden and other leaders throughout the West, not just elected ones, but the NGO community, continue to do what they've done for the past 20 years and suppress fossil fuels, it will be a code red disaster. Millions of people will starve to death. Billions of people will drop into poverty. Unlike rising oceans, that effect is guaranteed,.But Joe Biden doesn't care, assuming he knows. He's not going to be here for that anyway. His new executive order will spend more than $2 billion on wind power in the Gulf of Mexico. How much energy does a windmill produce? No, not how much can it produce, how much does it produce and where does it go? Just for fun, if you have a day free, try to get an answer to that question. You can't. No one asks. No one cares.  Biden is also ordering the Secretary of the Interior to ""advance clean energy development all over the country,"" which means pay off his donors, of course. That means more electric cars, solar panels, etc., etc.. So, who benefits from this? That's always the first question. Well, of course, Democratic donors benefit. They're getting rich from this, but who makes all this stuff? Well, China makes almost all of it. China makes 76% of the world's lithium-ion batteries. China makes 75% of the world's solar panels. China makes virtually all of the world's wind turbines. Seven of the world's ten biggest wind turbine manufacturers are based in China.So that means China will have control of our energy grid. If you control a country's energy grid, you control that country. It's really simple. On CBS recently, Joe Biden's energy coordinator, Amos Hochstein, explained why that's a good thing.   Look at that little sleazeball. Oh, yeah. Got to hand China control of our energy grid, the biggest, the most efficient in the world, the country with the world's largest recoverable oil reserves – that would be the United States of America. But we can't use any of that. We have to give China control of our energy, which is to say, of our country, of our economy. The world is making investments, so we're being left behind.  Okay. Well, the rest of the world has gone deeper into the Green Delusion than we have, none of which helps the actual environment, by the way, in case you care about nature. Nature is not helped by any of this. But the rest of the world has been a lot more eager than the United States to dive right into the Green New Deal. So, how has that worked for them? We can't say this enough. It has been an unqualified disaster.   In the first quarter of this year, just a few years after the Berlin Senate declared a climate emergency, so-called renewables accounted for 50% of all German electricity consumption. So, what happened next? Well, Germany can't keep the lights on and is very worried about winter coming.  As The Washington Post put it, ""Hamburg landlords are rationing hot water. Berlin may turn off nonessential traffic lights at night."" Oh, no traffic lights. Oh, that's a civilized country. How's that working for you? In Great Britain, no country has ever evaporated faster in world history than that one, but in the U.K., more than 90% of the population lives in a place where local authorities have just declared a climate emergency. Now they have more urgent emergencies, it turns out, actual emergencies, back here in the physical, not theoretical world where we need, like traffic lights and power that comes out of the outlet. There are real emergencies. In April, the British government announced that the number of households in the UK living in ""fuel poverty"" now stands at 5 million.Oh, this isn't wartime rationing. The blitz is over. This is right now in 2022. How about Argentina? In 2019, Argentina's government declared a climate emergency, even though, unlike China or India, it's not really contributing to global carbon emissions. Argentina produces about 1% of global carbon emissions. But they did it anyway because it seemed like the fashionable thing to do, plus ESG. ""We're modern. We're against climate.""  Well, today, what happened? Argentina is experiencing, well, there's no other way to put it, collapse. The collapse was not caused by a half-degree rise in average temperatures in the non-Patagonian continental area. No, it was caused by what is always caused by: spiking energy costs which cause inflation. Inflation is now over 60% in Argentina. Argentina is now too broke to function. ""Access to fertilizers and diesel is urgent to avoid complete paralysis,"" a farmers group in Argentina wrote to the government recently. Wait, farmers don't have access to fertilizers? What? How can you grow things without fertilizer? Well, fertilizer isn't , and we've got a climate emergency, so no fertilizer for you. Oh, except that means no food and then people starve. That happened in Sri Lanka, as we've told you repeatedly. We can't say this enough. In Sri Lanka, the government banned all fertilizers. As a result, food prices are up by 80%. In a poor country, that's not a small thing. Again, people starve.  Has John Kerry contributing to the food bank in Sri Lanka? No, of course not. He's bombing often his own plane to another global warming conference. How about the Netherlands? A rich country, the world's second largest ag exporter in the name of climate, in 2019, the European Parliament declared a—wait for it—climate emergency in the Netherlands.    So, the government forced farmers there to cut livestock by 50% because cow flatulence...Sandy Cortez has actually done a TikTok on this, I think. Cow flatulence, huge problem. So, we need what the EU called an unavoidable transition. What happened then? Oh, riots. Our leaders are telling us we need the same thing here.It's a climate emergency. It's code red. You have no choice and they mean it and you don't get to vote on an either because they're so for democracy that they're going to force it down your throat with no vote at all. What happens next? Well, poverty, chaos, and then the lights go out.   "	torches President Biden environmental policies benefit China dramatic press conferences recent history sitting president United States announced

393	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-great-replacement-electoral-strategy	2022-07-19 22:51:00	Tucker Carlson: The great replacement is an electoral strategy | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to United States' population growth being fueled by migration on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Looking back, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 turned out to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever passed by the U.S. Congress. Now, the people who wrote it knew that it would be so naturally spent a lot of time trying to convince everyone else that, in fact, it was no big deal. ""This is not a revolutionary bill,"" assured Lyndon Johnson when he signed it – he first tip that it was, in fact, a revolutionary bill. And then there was this. On the Senate floor, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, the man who drove the bill, went out of his way to explain that the Democratic Party was absolutely not trying to replace the American population with more compliant foreign-born voters. No way. That's an insane conspiracy theory he explained. ""This bill will not flood our cities with immigrants,"" Kennedy said. ""It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs."" It's all bitterly amusing when you look back at it, because, of course, that is precisely what this bill did. This bill changed America completely and forever and the numbers show it. In the years since that legislation passed, the United States total population exploded by 140 million people. You're seeing that chart on your screen right now. What direction does it point? Well, steadily upward. That's the population.   Now, where did all those people come from? Nothing wrong with more people. The question is, who are they and where do they come from? Well, what you're seeing is not the kind of organic growth that you would see in a healthy society that's become more prosperous and welcoming of families. It's not like people were so confident in the future they decided to have more kids. No, it's just the opposite, exactly the opposite of that.  In fact. Since Ted Kennedy's bill became law, birth rates among native born Americans, which are the clearest possible measure of optimism in the future, those have dropped off a cliff and you're seeing that chart on the screen now. It's the inverse of the first chart. This chart points downward. In 2020, the most recent year for which we have data, the overall fertility rate in the United States hit the lowest point ever recorded, and that was before COVID. This country is now well under the so-called replacement level. That means if we continue on this trajectory and no one's trying to take us off this trajectory, eventually there will be no more native-born Americans. So you put these two graphs together, and what do they show you? Well, they show you a number of things, but here's the main one. Sometime around 1965, our leaders stopped trying to make the United States a hospitable place for American citizens, their constituents, to have their own families. That used to be considered the central task of leadership -- perpetuating the population. If people are happy and confident, they'll have kids.   They're vested in the society and if they're not, they won't. That was their job. So, they stopped doing it and instead they just imported new people. That's literally what happened. Now, you're not allowed to point this out, of course. The media become absolutely hysterical when you do because it's so obviously true. What's interesting is that if something like this happened in any other country, say, in China or Japan or Nigeria, the populations of those countries would likely revolt because you can't do that. The leaders of a country can't change the population of the country, especially in a democracy without the consent of the existing population. So, if those populations in, say, Nigeria, for example, revolted, the New York Times should be deeply sympathetic to their outrage. Again, you can't just replace the electorate because you didn't like the last election outcomes. That would be the definition of undermining democracy, changing the voters. But when it happens in this country, there is mandatory media enforced silence and in fact, if you notice it's happening, it's your fault. You're immoral. You're a racist, but it has nothing to do with race. It's about change and it's absolutely real.  The majority of population growth since 1965 has come from immigration, not from Americans having more kids. In 1965, the number of permanent illegal migrants in this country from Latin America was essentially zero. They were migrant farm workers, but there were no huge populations of people living here illegally. By 2008, that number had grown to perhaps 20 million people. They lied about it, but the best estimates suggest it was tens of millions.And then came Joe Biden. Joe Biden accelerated that sad trend beyond what anyone thought was possible. The foreign-born population is now growing by 132,000 people every month.   That's more than triple the average high under previous administrations. It's double Barack Obama's highest totals. According to AEI scholar Mark Perry, we can expect over 9 million new illegal aliens by the end of Joe Biden's first term. Nothing like this has ever happened in this or maybe any other country ever and it's happening for one reason. It's not natural. It's the product of a policy choice. Joe Biden promised amnesty to anyone who makes it across our border. So, in 2019, for example, the Trump administration criminally prosecuted 110,000 illegal migrants for violating immigration law. Not that they were bad people. Some of them were great people, but you're not allowed to go into someone else's country without permission. That's what the law is and if you ignored the law, you are no longer a real country.  You're something less than that. You're a failed state. So, you have to enforce the law, including immigration law, but Joe Biden stopped doing it. Last year, Joe Biden prosecuted fewer than 3000 total. That's according to DHS data obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. That's a drop of nearly 98%. So naturally, people are coming because why wouldn't you want to move to the United States knowing that when you get here, you will be treated like someone who deserves to be here and given every possible public benefit? You'd be crazy not to come and so they are in massive numbers and then traveling, often at public expense paid for by you without your knowledge, throughout the United States. Watch one border agent explain what exactly is happening.      So, here's another thing that's changed since 1965, along with our population. Politicians no longer feel they need to pretend, partly because the population is so different. You've got a lot more people with permanent jobs in American politics. So, unlike Lyndon Johnson, Joe Biden didn't pretend that his goal was not to change the population. He said it out loud. During the campaign, Biden referred to  as a gift. Watch. t.    It's a gift, says a man who has worked in a public job his entire life, who's never had a real job ever, is lecturing you about the economy and how it works as if he knows. By the way, in that tape, Joe Biden was so senile that his wife and his handlers gave him drugs before that interview. That interview that you just saw. So, that's the guy telling you about the economic benefits of illegal immigration. Now most, you're not supposed to notice that that conversation even took place. Just like you're not supposed to notice when the New York Times prints an op ed called ""We Can Replace Them,"" because that's a dangerous conspiracy theory. What are you, Alex Jones? No, we just watch carefully, not even that carefully. They say it constantly. The great replacement. Yeah. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's their electoral strategy and we know that because they see it all the time. Here's some examples.   So, how is that a source of strength? He never explained. So, clearly it's the source of the Democratic Party's strength, they believe, though, actually their plan might not work out for them, since a lot of the people arriving may not be sympathetic to Joe Biden. Who possibly could be? But electoral politics are really secondary to the real concern, which is the stability of the country. So, the problem with what the Democratic Party is doing right now is not simply that it helps the Democratic Party, though we think that's bad. The problem is that they're doing it way too fast. This is too much change at once for any society ever, at any point in history. No society can metabolize this many new people and stay stable, especially not now in this specific moment, because two unprecedented waves of human migration, you have to add, let's see, , food shortages, skyrocketing housing prices, falling wages, the trauma of two and a half years of COVID, the manufactured racial strife you saw Joe Biden himself encouraging. You put all that together and you have the most volatile possible mix of social factors.So, into that you throw millions of brand-new people who have no connection to America whatsoever, people who broke our laws to get here, who don't speak our language, who have no idea what the U.S. Constitution says and don't care and what do you have when you put all of that together? You have a recipe for social collapse.   This is why no sane government would ever do this. The Chinese government would never consider doing this. Even corrupt, dumb governments that can't even keep a national airline flying would never do something like this to their own countries because they all want their own countries to collapse and it's not an attack on the people coming here, by the way, some of whom are legitimately great people and want to be here for the right reasons. The problem is the volume. No country can withstand what we're going through right now and in our specific case, it turns out that a lot of the people coming are not ready to participate in a democracy. A huge percentage of the migrants crossing the border today are functionally illiterate. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, ""41% of immigrants score at or below the lowest level of English literacy, a level variously described as below basic or functionally illiterate."" Now add to this the problems that American-born people are having with English after two years of COVID and suspended education and a life spent staring into a screen. What does that look like? A lot of people who are moving here, are not becoming assimilated and we know that because many haven't learned English after living here for years. The same study found that 67% of Hispanic immigrants do not develop English proficiency even after 15 years of living in United States. That means around 5 million migrants became citizens without even being able to speak our language.  Once again, not an attack on them, an attack on the people running the country. This could capsize the United States. This is a huge, sprawling country with a massive population. So, the question from day one has always been, what holds everyone together? What is the one thing we all have in common? It's not an ethnic group. It's not a shared history. Now it's not a language. So, what is it?  Well, in the absence of glue, things break apart. That's a physic principle. So, no one who cared about the future of this country would do this to the country. It is truly insanity and yet the Biden administration is trying to make it worse, working hard to make it worse. Fox News is reporting tonight that the administration awarded $172 million grant to a George Soros-linked organization which exists to ""help young border crossers avoid deportation."" Now, why is some foreign-born billionaire allowed to change our country fundamentally? That's the big question. Here are the specifics. This organization is called the Vera Institute for Justice, and it stands to gain a billion dollars in federal money by the end of the contract just to subvert our laws. Now, the catch is that no one verifies whether the people crossing the border are actually minors. You can't know who they are. By definition, they're here illegally and after 9/11, didn't we care about the authenticity of documents? Didn't we have a Real I.D. Act?  Well, we don't know how old they are and that's how 24-year-old Medina Ulloa was able to enter this country and murder a father of four in the backyard of his house in Florida in October. He posed as a child so that Joe Biden would fight him at your expense to Jacksonville in the middle of the night. So, courtesy of the Biden administration, unaccompanied minors like Medina Ulloa are also arriving in New York and Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Arizona and many other places. According, for example, to 12 News in Phoenix representatives for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport reported that hundreds of migrants showed up recently with no booked tickets. Roughly 3 to 400 refugees have arrived every single day by bus in recent months. So why are all of these illegal aliens arriving in Phoenix?    Well, many of them are dropped off by a nonprofit called RCBH, which brags it's helped nearly 20,000 illegal aliens released by immigration authorities without charges moving all over the country and that's where it's happening, all over the country. In Brownsville, Texas, Fox News observed busses contracted by the Biden administration dropping off dozens of male migrants at a parking garage.  Our reporters witnessed those migrants go into an unmarked office. They get picked up by taxicabs and driven to the airport. None of them were children. Commercial airline pilots right now are being told to fly these people all over the country. We spoke to a pilot who's doing it every day and we're quoting, ""We are breaking the law, transporting illegals, many of whom are unaccompanied minors.""   Why is this continuing? Because neither party is interested in stopping it. On this question, as on foreign policy, there's only one party, the uni-party, and its aligned against your most basic interests no matter what color you are, by the way. Instead, both parties are finding new ways to give American jobs to foreign-born applicants; 62 Republicans just joined, to their eternal shame, with almost every single Democrat in the House to pass the national defense bill. Now tucked away in that $840 billion piece of legislation, is a plan to give away even more American jobs to foreign workers as if we need this now.  So, now the children of H-1B visa workers will receive citizenship because their parents took jobs in this country. Oh, how does that work, exactly? ""Shut up, racist."" Again, it's not about race. It's about economics and social cohesion, both of which they're destroying. Now, according to our Congress, fewer jobs for Americans somehow makes this country safer. That's been their plan since 1965 and since 1965 both parties have supported it.  "	reacts United States population growth fueled migration Looking back Immigration Nationality Act 1965 turned

396	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-look-potential-candidates-replace-biden-save-democratic-party	2022-07-18 22:20:00	Tucker: A look at the potential candidates to replace Biden and save the Democratic Party | Fox News	"Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.As we reported on Friday,  from such severe dementia during the 2020 presidential campaign that his wife and his staff medicated him before his public appearances. We're not guessing about that. We spoke directly to an eyewitness who saw it happen multiple times. That means that everyone around Joe Biden has known perfectly well for more than three years that he is incapable of serving as president and yet knowing that they foisted him on the country anyway. Why did they do that? Well, of course, to carry out a task, to carry out the revolution, then the historic protections of free speech and self-defense in the United States, to hobble domestic energy production, to scramble gender roles until no one can think clearly and then hook the middle class on federal handouts. That was his job. Like certain species of marsupials, Joe Biden's task was to do one big thing. In his case, change the country forever and then disappear. We've reached the disappearing part right about now. Democrats would like Joe Biden gone soon. He's longer useful to them. He's just embarrassing. He shakes hands with thin air. He compliments the Holocaust on state trips to Israel. Can't do that. So, not surprisingly, almost 70% of Democratic voters don't want Joe Biden to run again. So, you can be certain that he won't. No matter what his staff is claiming now, they don't want to be relegated to lame duck status, so they're pretending otherwise, but no matter what they say, you will never hear another word from Joe Biden after January of 2025, assuming he makes it that long.  So, the question really is, who replaces Joe Biden? The scramble begins now. Now, it's early enough that we can't really say. We can't say at all, in fact. The only thing we can say is which candidate seems to believe they could be the next Democratic nominee. And so far, it is an amazing lineup that reveals a lot about the state of the Democratic Party 2022.   First on the list, believe it or not, is the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker is an inherited money dolt. He's impressed not a single person who knows him, but he yet spent more than $171 million of his family's money to get a job that he does not seem to enjoy and certainly isn't very good at. J.B. Pritzker is one of the last people on Earth who should be running anything and yet somehow he's convinced himself he's going to be the next president. Here's J.B. Pritzker in New Hampshire in June. Imagine the consultant who convinced J.B. Pritzker to leave his collapsing state and head to New Hampshire because really, you're going to be president, J.B. So, he's running. Who else is running? Well, if you want to know the answer to that, look around and ask yourself which elected Democrats are attacking Ron DeSantis? He's the candidate they think, many of them believe, they will face. So, who's attacking Ron DeSantis? Well, here's  He's got a new ad in Florida. Watch.   Come join us in California. Leave Florida. He's got some wuevos. You got to give him that. Gavin Newsom then gave a television interview, not saying he's running for president, but suggesting that maybe you speculate about it. Watch.     He's walking outside the White House without his jacket on, flexing a little bit and those teeth. Where did he get those teeth? We'd like to know the man who installed them. So those are the two most prominent people as of tonight who apparently believe they can replace Joe Biden. That would be the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, and the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker.  Now, if you're not laughing right now, you're dead inside, not least because of the way they look and yes, appearance not simply matters of the Democratic Party, it is determinative. That party has spent the last decade telling us that White men are evil. White men must be removed from positions of leadership except within their party, where White men continue to run everything.  What does that remind you of? It's kind of like flying private to the global warming summit or going maskless as you enforce COVID mandates, both of which  and Gavin Newsom have done. So, they've passed the hypocrisy test already. But as long as the anti-White party is going to ignore highly qualified leaders of color like Stacey Abrams or Tiara Mack of Rhode Island, and instead continuing to run White men, you think they can at least pick non-ridiculous White men, but no. Instead, they are getting behind the two guys who run the most dysfunctional states out of 50.  How do we know that? By what people do. Ignore what people say. Be more like your dog. Watch actions. Ignore words. More people are emigrating from California, which is to say fleeing from California, than from any other state in the country and some of them are literally running to Mexico in the middle of a drug war in search of a better life, and they're getting it, that's the thing. Californians now pay more income tax than any other state, and yet there's more poverty in California than any other state. California leads the nation in homelessness. They are everywhere. Check an overpass in L.A. County. People living under it. American citizens. In the last two years, murders in L.A. went up by 35%. Already in the first half of this year, homicides in Los Angeles have set a 15-year record.You're going to run on that, Gavin Newsom? They're robbing trains in your state like it's 1880. And then there's Illinois, and we don't want to be mean. Both are great states, nice people, the ones who haven't yet moved to Florida, it's about four of them left.  Illinois ranks third in net migration. New York's in the middle, between California and Illinois. The Chicago-Naperville area lost 107,000 people just last year. That's one of the highest losses for any metropolitan region in the United States. L.A. and San Francisco also right near the top of that list. So, again, if you want to judge someone's success, ask yourself, are people moving to the place that person governs or are they running at high speed in the other direction?Illinois and California are in the second category. According to the Illinois Policy Institute, Illinois loses a resident every 4 minutes. Now, how many people is that? Well, over a year. That's the equivalent of losing the entire city of Springfield, which is the capital of Illinois. How many are going to Florida? Well, most of them. One of the reasons that Illinois isn't safe anymore is because people with jobs are leaving. As of July 10th year-to-date, total crimes in the city of Chicago are up 34% year over year. Now, who's responsible for this? Hmm, who's running it? Well, J.B. Pritzker is running it. And everyone who lives there, who still lives there, who's too tired to get out or can afford to flee to Broward County, is mad about it and that's why every time J.B. Pritzker goes outside, sweating profusely, he gets yelled at. Watch.   There he is with a mask on outside. You just imagine him going back to his box and saying, ""What were they saying?"" ""They love you, governor, they love you,""But they don't and they shouldn't. Under J.B. Pritzker, Illinois has become much poorer, much more dangerous, and much less free. The violent crime rate in Chicago has increased by nearly 40%. Again, his state. So, what does he done about that? How many lives is you saved? No, you know, the real problem, says J.B. Pritzker, it's law-abiding people in Indiana who own guns. It's your fault. Watch.  .  Oh, haranguing in the public, people who have done literally nothing wrong except try to protect their own homes from the criminals that J.B. Pritzker has loosed on the state of Illinois. No wonder they're screaming at him. He doesn't punish criminals. He attacks law abiding citizens instead and that's a theme with Pritzker. He's the one who imposed a mask mandate on schools in the state based on no, on oh, precisely zero scientific evidence, none and parents understood it. Their kids were being destroyed by this. So, here's how parents in Naperville reacted earlier this year. Watch.   So, you'd think if you'd inherited as much money as J.B. Pritzker has – billions – you wouldn't need to listen to the teachers' unions. You fund your campaigns. Why do you care what the teachers' unions think, which, ironically, are the national focus of anti-children policies? Find anybody in America who dislikes children as thoroughly and intensely as the teachers unions do, and that person should be in jail, but J.B. Pritzker not only listens to the teachers' unions, he is their slave. So, once you start thinking irrationally and once science has no bearing whatsoever on your public health policy, God knows we're going to wind up. In J.B. Pritzker's case, he banned families from stepping on boats because it was dangerous. Watch.   Hey, greaseball where did you get the right to tell me how many people can come on my boat? Nobody asked that question. ""Well, really, It's on the boat or on the dock."" Nobody said anything and so J.B. Pritzker kept going, listing was consoles, ""They love you,"" but nothing changes the bottom-line fact. Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker run the dirtiest, most dangerous state in the country with the worst cities—Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, great places, all, all places that have been destroyed and the basis of that record of destruction, they become convinced they run the country. They need to be president. Now, if that's not hilarious, what is?  These are ridiculous people. Newsom looks like an ad for a plastic surgery clinic. Ah, look at the teeth. J.B. Pritzker can barely walk to the podium. So again, who's the consultant who managed to keep a straight face while telling J.B. Pritzker he could be president? We'd love that man's name. ""People love you, J.B. You can do it.""  "	Check clicking Foxnews com reported Friday severe dementia 2020 presidential campaign wife staff medicated public appearances guessing spoke directly eyewitness saw multiple times

He went on to serve as physicians to the two subsequent presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, so Ronny Jackson knows a lot about what it takes to run the country.  During the 2020 presidential campaign, Jackson was home watching Joe Biden deliver a speech, and what he saw Biden say bothered him deeply as a physician. Biden had just announced that he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Watch.   So, Ronny Jackson saw that and then went on Twitter and he made the obvious point.  before this goes any further, should undergo a cognitive examination. The country deserves that. Well, within 20 minutes, Jackson recalls in his new memoir, Barack Obama sent him an email, a characteristically sneering one and we're quoting, ""I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter,"" Obama said. ""It was unprofessional. I expect better.""  So, that wasn't just Obama speaking. That was the uniform command of the people who run the Democratic Party throughout the 2020 campaign. Do not notice what Joe Biden is actually like. If you see him on television turn away because you might conclude he is fundamentally, physically, cognitively unfit for office. You can't say that and if you do, Barack Obama will scold you personally immediately. Well, fast-forward a few years. Joe Biden is now the president and his mental decline is no longer possible to deny, and therefore it's no longer off limits. Barack Obama isn't going out and defending Joe Biden's competence anymore. Everybody watching, everyone in the media, that would include Barack Obama's former advisers, is now in agreement that Joe Biden is senile and cannot govern the United States.      So, the problem with Joe Biden, says, Mark McKinnon, is that he's White. Notice the casual racism of the left, 2022. It's ubiquitous. You barely even notice it. That's not the problem with Joe Biden. Who cares what his skin color is? The problem Joe Biden is he's cognitively unable to serve, but take three steps back. That's not Joe Biden's fault. It's not his fault he has dementia.  No, the fact that Joe Biden is president is an indictment of the media and the Democratic Party because they have known. Contrary to what they're telling you now, , his fullblown senility has been obvious for more than three years. We noticed. We're not doctors. By the way, we had no special animus toward Joe Biden at all, but we watched him and we said this out loud for the first time, we checked today, on May 14, 2019.    But wait a second, you're saying to yourself, that didn't make any sense. Not a single phrase in a full minute of talking conveyed an intelligible idea, not one. That wasn't even word salad. It was a verbal Jackson Pollack painting. Nouns, verbs, adjectives spilled like cans of paint bleeding into each other—a sticky, post-modern mess. At one point, Biden actually jumped from point two directly to point four just to let you know that your old-fashioned linear assumptions about numerical sequencing are no good here, man. That's yesterday's mathematics.  So, we put it on the air back in 2019. Again, not because we are particularly against Joe Biden. He seemed a lot better than Beto O'Rourke or Mayor Pete. We put it on because we happened to be watching one day and tried to follow what he was saying about China because it seemed important. Not one national news organization had noted at all that this guy couldn't speak in complete sentences, couldn't convey coherent ideas. Nobody had ever mentioned that and of course, anyone in Washington who knew Joe Biden. He had been there since 1972 and basically most people kind of liked him. He was a friendly guy.  This was not the Joe Biden anyone who knew Joe Biden had seen before. He completely changed. This was clearly cognitive decline. This was dementia, obviously. So, we drew a conclusion that now sounds ridiculous, but it seemed logical at the time. This guy can't be the Democratic nominee. He can barely speak. How did he manage to get through the campaign? Well, it turned out, we learned later, his staff supervised by Dr. Jill, his wife, was giving him pills before every public appearance, checking the time in at a certain hour, giving him a dose of something. Now, it's not a guess. We're not making that up. We've spoken directly to someone who was there and saw it happen multiple times.  Now, before taking the medication, this person said, Biden was ""like a small child. You couldn't communicate with him."" He changed completely because he was on drugs and he clearly still is on drugs. No one's pushing to know what those drugs are. We should know. But the point is, Joe Biden's dementia was perfectly obvious to everyone around him more than three years ago. So, we never thought this could happen. You can't make a senile man, president of the United States. This is our country. This is a real country. It needs a real leader even one you disagree with, but someone is in full possession was faculties. No one would ever do that. It's crazy.  We were completely wrong. We were wrong because we underestimated the cynicism and the recklessness of the Democratic Party and the media who serve them. They will say literally anything, no matter how implausible or immoral, if it brings them more power. They knew exactly how incapacitated Joe Biden was. They lied about it and the disaster we're living with today is a direct result of their lying and it's getting worse. It's humiliating. Yesterday, for example, we could go on for an hour, we're not going to, but just to sum it up, yesterday Joe Biden tried to shake an invisible man's hand. Not the first time he's done this. He did the same thing in April and both of those sad moments are on tape. Here they are.   So, if you don't like Biden or his agenda and we certainly don't, there is a kind of partisan glee you take from this. Look how pathetic he is but, you know, if you're an American, there's no upside. Actually, this is horrible for all of us. It reflects poorly not just on the Democratic Party or Biden himself, but on our country and it's happening constantly with increasing frequency. On Wednesday of this week, during a trip to Israel. Biden announced that we have to keep alive the ""honor of the Holocaust.""   It's just absolutely awful and again, there's no upside. So, Joe Biden's senile. Everybody knows it. Do we win a prize now? No. We watch our country degrade. So, you have to ask, who did this to the rest of us? Who's responsible for putting this guy in a position where he was elected president? Well, we could start the list of the culpable with Joe Biden's 2020 campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon. She did this. Where is she now? Well, she's now deputy chief of staff in the White House. She knew exactly how senile Joe Biden was. Susan Rice knew well, too. Of course, she did. Susan Rice now runs America's domestic policy out of the White House. Ron Klain knew perfectly well that Joe Biden was not fit to be president, that he has dementia. Ron Klain was elevated to White House chief of staff and of course, Dr. Jill, his wife, was perfectly aware. Members of Joe Biden's own family knew perfectly well and told other people about it. We've reported that before and it's true and yet they didn't stop him.  Mike Donilon was the chief strategist of Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Now he's one of Biden's ""senior advisers."" Same with Anita Dunn. She was once co campaign manager. She's now another senior adviser for Biden and a former Obama communications director. She has massive power in this country. That's how she was rewarded for foisting this guy on the rest of us. Brian Deese, same thing. The man who screwed up our climate and energy policy during the Obama years, he knew perfectly well Joe Biden was senile, but he wanted power again. So, he didn't say a word. Once again, same principle at work.   People make grave errors in judgment. They do something horrible to the United States of America, and they're rewarded for it. They're never punished. They're rewarded. These people now run the countryAnd above all, Barack Obama. Barack Obama knew perfectly well that Joe Biden was senile. Barack Obama spent eight years making fun of Joe Biden and degrading Joe Biden. Because Joe Biden has no dignity, He put up with it, but Obama knew that Biden wasn't fit to be president and that matters because Obama is and has always been the person actually running the Democratic Party and of course, the media knew. They knew perfectly well, but they lied. From day one, they lied. Here they are telling us during the campaign that Joe Biden actually (shut up, ageist) he just is perfectly fine.        Every one of those people knew. Again, we knew and said so out loud not because we have some special entree into the secrets of the Democratic Party. We certainly don't. Were hardly Democratic Party insiders, but because we watch TV for 90 seconds and we saw unmistakably the signs of dementia in Joe Biden. Every one of the people you just saw lied about what they knew. They hid that fact from you and the rest of the country because they wanted more power, but now the game is over for Joe Biden. As Mark McKinnon said he's just too White. So, suddenly our media is admitting what we noted three years ago and that everyone knew, that this was a scam. They are living with the mess they created, and we hope that they will never be allowed to avoid responsibility for what they did. "	voices concerns President Biden alleged mental decline interesting

402	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-politicians-continuing-use-covid-pretext-force-agendas	2022-07-14 21:39:00	Tucker Carlson: Politicians are continuing to use COVID as a pretext to force their agendas | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to Biden administration claims about combating the coronavirus pandemic on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Nobody wants to talk about COVID anymore, and that's certainly understandable. This country lost so much in two years. It's depressing to think about it and the instinct is just to move on, but unfortunately, we don't have that luxury and for two reasons.  First, politicians are continuing to use the virus as a pretext to force their agendas on an unwilling and weary population. That's happening still, believe it or not and second, and maybe more significantly, long term, somebody has got to rescue science from the ideologues who all of a sudden have taken it over. Science must be objective. Science must be honest. Otherwise, everything falls apart. So, with that in mind, this story. In April of last year, researchers at the CDC concluded a months long study of thousands of health care workers. They included first responders, nurses and physicians. The point of the study was to assess whether the COVID vaccine was working. Researchers split the health care workers into two groups, vaccinated and unvaccinated, and then they watched. What they found was so significant that the head of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, went directly to MSNBC to tell the world what researchers had found and here's what she said.  This is word for word: ""Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick and that's not just in clinical trials, but also in real-world data."" Now, that turned out not simply to be untrue, but in some sense to be the opposite of the truth. In some cases, the vaccinated are more likely to get variants of COVID. The death rates around the world for the  are extraordinarily high, but at the time, anyone who had doubts about what Rochelle Walensky said was told to shut up.    Those who questioned her out loud were kicked off social media. If you kept questioning, you might be fired from your job. Doubting Rochelle Walensky's promises, doubting the Biden administration's claims about the COVID vaccine was totally unacceptable. It was like questioning their views on herd immunity or mandatory masking for children or airline passengers or closing the schools.  Now that we know that virtually everything they said about COVID was wrong, however, no one has admitted it, and no one has been punished. No one at the CDC was fired for this. In fact, they were elevated. Under Joe Biden, the people who made these claims, these false claims, have even more power than ever. Rochelle Walensky is back on television. She's demanding that parents force their children as young as six months old to . They're all saying this, Tony Fauci, Joe Biden too. Watch.    Amazingly, despite all of their demonstrated failures, all of their documented dishonesty, those three people are still, as of tonight, in charge of this country's response to COVID. It's remarkable, if you think about it. So, parents thinking about how to treat their own children are in a very tough position. One of the COVID shots that Walensky and Fauci and Biden are telling you to give your small kids is manufactured by Moderna.  Now, you might recall that Moderna's COVID vaccine for adults was suspended from use in several countries after researchers found that it caused potentially very dangerous heart inflammation in young people. The other COVID vaccine that's been approved for toddlers in the United States is made by Pfizer. Pfizer's vaccine for adults has also been linked to heart damage, to myocarditis in young people. So, a lot of parents are wondering, should we give this to our toddler? How do we find the answer?   Virtually every news show in America seems to be sponsored by Pfizer, so clearly turning on television is not going to give you an answer you can trust. You need to find an independent, science-minded researcher or physician who's looked at the actual data. And there are very few who who've done that and are willing to be honest about it.  is one of them. He's just written a remarkable piece in Bari Weiss' Substack, and he wrote it with epidemiologist Tracy Hoeg.  Makary and Hoeg found that Pfizer and Moderna provided, and were quoting, ""extremely weak, inconclusive data"" to justify vaccinating children as young as six months in the United States. ""Using a three-dose vaccine in 992 children between the ages of six months and five years, Pfizer found no statistically significant evidence of vaccine efficacy,"" they wrote. ""In the subgroup of children aged six months to two years of trial found that the vaccine could result in a 99% lower chance of infection, but that they also have a 370% increased chance of being infected.""  What does that mean? We have no idea, and we don't know how you would know because those data are completely incoherent. They do not present a picture that suggests a path forward. They're inherently confusing. Meanwhile, Moderna ""claimed a very weak vaccine efficacy of just 4% in children aged six months to two years."" That is not a statistically significant result either. So, based on those numbers, apparently those are the underlying numbers, how could the Biden administration, how could the people who run public health in the United States of America push for the immediate  over the ages of six months? We need to assess what exactly these data are and why public health agencies seem to be ignoring them. "	reacts Biden administration claims combating coronavirus pandemic Nobody wants COVID anymore

405	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-most-dishonest-people-yelling-loudest-war-russia	2022-07-13 22:29:00	Tucker Carlson: The most dishonest people are yelling loudest for a war with Russia | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out the Biden administration for sending billions of dollars to Ukraine while Americans suffer with record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'When we say good evening, we mean it and tonight, we want to send a special, as they say on talk radio, shout out to our most loyal and faithful viewers. We love you. We appreciate you. In fact, we think of you as all little tacos and your children as taquitos and not just tacos and taquitos, but also enchiladas and chalupas and everything else on the Taco Bell menu. That's how we think of you. So, the good news is America at this stage is getting a lot more amusing. The bad news is it's also getting a little scary. So today, in the second category, the government announced that inflation has once again set a year-over-year record. But now we're used to this. If you buy anything, you already knew it was happening. Boy, did you. But there were parts of today's Labor Department report that were not expected by anyone. In fact, they were bizarre. They seemed to defy the most basic rules of economics, but first, here are the raw numbers. This is from a Fox News report today. So, the biggest annual spike in inflation in more than 40 years. That's the headline. But if anything, it understates what's actually going on. The reality of it is worse than that. During the Carter years, when inflation famously hit 14.6%, wages were still going up. As Pew put it in a recent analysis, ""During the high inflation years of the 1970s and early 1980s, average wages commonly jumped seven, eight, even 9% year over year"" and that makes sense. There's more money in circulation. It's worth less, but there's more of it. But that is not what is happening right now and that's the weird thing.   According to the Labor Department report today, ""Real average hourly earnings decreased 3.6%, seasonally adjusted from June 2021 to June 2022. The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a decrease of 0.9% of the average workweek, resulted in a 4.4% decrease in real average weekly earnings over this period."" 4.4% average decrease in earnings. This is what economic disaster looks like.  Americans are making less money at exactly the moment when everything they buy from gas to groceries is more expensive and not just a little more expensive, a lot more expensive. Here's the big picture. The average American household income this year is about $87,000. Today's inflation numbers means the average household is losing nearly $8,000 a year just from inflation. By the way, that's using the government's cooked numbers, the 9.1% inflation number, which is derived from the intentionally deceptive consumer price index (CPI), so the real number is actually higher than that. Rising inflation with falling wages. This is very bad, and as we said, it's also very weird. How weird? Well, here's one measure of the strangeness. The  is now much cheaper in Mexico than it is in the United States, and that's why so many Californians are now driving across the border to fill their cars.  Now, why is this happening? That does not make sense. Oil prices set on the international market. But apart from a few outlier websites like ZeroHedge, which not coincidentally the left is always trying to shut down and censor, no one seems to be asking that question. We do know that gas prices in Mexico are so cheap that the Mexican government is encouraging more Americans to cross the border to refuel their cars.  ""Right now,"" said the president of Mexico this week, ""a gallon of regular cost $4.78 average on your side of the border, while in Mexico, it cost $3.12."" So, you have to ask yourself if we're paying more for gas because of Putin's price hike, why isn't Mexico paying more for gas because of Putin, too? Why is inflation up when wages are down? This doesn't make any sense. So, if you want to answer those questions, you really have to look at government spending.  Last month, Mexico's government did not follow the Biden administration's lead in sending the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. They did not do that. Instead, here's what Mexico did. They spent $2 billion in subsidies to keep gas prices lower for consumers. In other words, the government of Mexico in the middle of a drug war is taking better care of its citizens than Joe Biden is taking care of his citizens and that is shameful, but it doesn't mean Joe Biden is ignoring the needy.  In the very same month, the gas prices shot beyond the reach of people, people aren't taking trips because of gas prices, Joe Biden, in the name of democracy, signed a $40 billion aid package, not for you or any other American, but for Ukraine and that money, Joe Biden says, is just the beginning. It's part of our unlimited commitment to funding Ukraine's corrupt and authoritarian government. Here's Biden.   Future generations will look at that tape and many tapes like it with their jaws open. As long as it takes! Whatever the cost for Ukraine! As the American economy heads toward total destruction, Ukrainians are dying in large numbers, who's winning? Well, Ukrainian oligarchs, they're getting richer, much richer. Since January of this year, the Biden administration has sent about $8 billion just in so-called security assistance alone to Ukraine. That would include missile systems, howitzers, ammunition, radar systems, etc., etc.  Now, defense contractors are making a ton from this, and that's why they have lobbied for it so hard, but you have to ask, once we send these weapons to Ukraine, where do they go then? What happens to them? These are sophisticated and deadly weapons systems. Well, no one knows where they go. No one's keeping track. U.S. officials, Biden administration officials have admitted that to The Wall Street Journal and we're quoting: ""Once U.S. equipment material is handed to the Ukrainian government U.S. officials said they have little direct knowledge of where that material goes. They rely instead on the Ukrainian government for such information. The administration has not agreed to allow American military troops to conduct some oversight into that country.""Huh?So, you send billions to Ukraine in the middle of a war, and then you don't bother to find out what happens to it? What will happen to these weapons? Well, the Czech defense minister knows he has said these weapons, some of them will be smuggled out of Ukraine, ""It's hard to avoid trafficking or smuggling. We didn't achieve it in the former Yugoslavia and we probably won't avoid it in Ukraine."" This is lunacy. If you wanted to make Eastern Europe dangerous and unstable for generations, ensure that war continues and many more die, this is exactly what you would do. You would treat Ukraine like we treated Afghanistan, but that's just the beginning of the money we're sending. On top of all of this security assistance, now, the head of USAID, that would be Samantha Power – she's never left, she's still here, amazingly, after wrecking the world – she's announced we're sending $4 billion more to Ukraine to pay off that country's budget deficit. Wouldn't that be nice if Samantha Power decided to pay off our budget deficit, if anyone decided to help us? But no, no one would ever do that.    So, your tax dollars are now paying the salaries of Ukrainian government bureaucrats. In all, your Congress has approved more than $50 billion for Ukraine. That includes $7 billion in food assistance and health care, along with $9 billion for economic support, whatever that means. There's also $2 billion for refugee assistance. So, just as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and I don't know, half a dozen other countries, we're sending bales of $100 bills into a war zone and hoping they find the right pockets.Again, this is nuts. And yet leaders of both parties agree we have to keep doing it, much more of it.  Dozens of Democrats in Congress just signed a letter pushing the administration, as if they needed to be pushed, toward the International Monetary Fund, a total of $650 billion in new funding because Ukraine and on top of all of that, Congressman Adam Kinzinger just proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for another hundred million for, ""Ukrainian military pilots and associated personnel."" Kinzinger is the guy who thought the ghost of Kiev was real.Now all of this is necessary. It's mandatory. We must, according to members of both parties, because we must defend democracy. Now we're not picking on Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Republican state, but we want to show you this tape. He just sat for an interview with Charlie Kirk and explained that we have to send an unlimited amount of money to Ukraine. Why? To ""fight back against communist intrusion for the cause of freedom because Vladimir Putin is evil."" Watch.   Yeah. Fighting the communist menace. These people never update their talking points. Senator Cramer invokes the cause of liberty and that's a phrase we strongly support. That's an idea we strongly support. That's why we're in favor of unfettered free speech. That's why we oppose vaccine mandates. But you have to ask yourself, what does the cause of liberty have to do with Ukraine? Well, very little. Last February, the Ukrainian government shut down opposition media. Then they arrested the leader of the main opposition party.  Now, President Zelenskyy has decided to combine all television stations in Ukraine into a state-owned propaganda ministry in order to combat ""misinformation."" Now, what is that? Well, I'll tell you what, it's not. It's not the profile of a free country. Not even close. The cause of liberty. May those words burn in your mouth. ""Oh, but we have to,"" they tell us,"" because Putin is worse. He's the worst person in the world."" He's a communist, says Senator Camer, who plans to conquer the globe.You don't have to like Vladimir Putin to see how absurd this is. Putin's a communist now. Really? How communist is Vladimir Putin? Is Vladimir Putin more or less communist than, say, Sandy Cortez? More or less communist than say Joe Biden's domestic policy team? Is he more committed atheist than they are? Is Putin throwing Americans in jail for attending political rallies at the Capitol? Is he trying to confiscate the rifles from your bedroom? Is he sterilizing children in the name of trans liberation? Whatever his many faults, no, Vladimir Putin is not doing any of that. As for his apparently limitless international ambitions, ask yourself, is Vladimir Putin recolonizing Africa right now? Is Vladimir Putin trying to build military bases in the Caribbean and South America? No, he's not, but another country is. That would be China, Joe Biden's patron. Putin wants Crimea. He may succeed in getting it, but it is China that is on its way to controlling the world. Here's a graphic we saw today that illustrates the point.   These are the relative sizes of the players in the global economy. The numbers are from the IMF. As you can see, the world is completely dominated by the economic power of China and the United States. As of today, our two economies roughly equal in size, though thanks to COVID, China is quickly pulling ahead. That is a problem. In fact, that is the biggest problem in the world by far. Nothing comes close because the Chinese empire will not be like our empire at all. So, where's Russia in this? How does it fit in? Well, get your reading glasses, because Russia is a footnote. It's not irrelevant, but it's close to irrelevant.Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's. The Italians, in other words, are in a better position to take over the  world than Vladimir Putin is.This entire conversation is insane. Anyone who takes it seriously is a fool, and anyone who doesn't see the red flags is probably dishonest. The most dishonest, the most power-hungry people in the United States are the very ones yelling the loudest for a war with Russia. That would be Joe Biden. That would be Nancy Pelosi. That'd be Chuck Schumer. That'd be Adam Schiff.  These are the people telling you that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal bent on world domination. Why are they saying that? Why are you suggesting Vladimir Putin's going to take over Europe? That's not true, but why are they saying it?   Well, there's a reason, a reason that has precisely nothing to do with saving lives or making Ukraine a better country. Again, red flag, anyone? And yet somehow Republicans don't see it. They don't seem curious about why the worst people in America are for an endless  In fact, apart from Marjorie Taylor Greene and a few other Republicans in Congress, they are all in. Whatever Joe Biden wants in Ukraine they support. Here, for example, is Lindsey Graham with his little friend Richard Blumenthal, that would be Connecticut's most famous Vietnam War hero. Here they are together.     Defeat Putin. Will that improve your life? Is it improving the lives of the Ukrainians right now? No, it's not and yet every person who has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision going back 40 years is on the same page and that, of course, would include John Bolton, the former national security adviser, who by the way just admitted on national television that he has personally engineered coups in foreign countries. Wait, we're not for democracy? Apparently not. John Bolton isn't. But wasn't democracy the whole point? Were those coups statesponsored terror? No one's asking. No one's calling John Bolton a war criminal. Instead, here's what they're saying.  Wait, what? I tuned in to find out whether I should buy Cisco on the dip and you're a foreign policy expert now. The American economy is in serious trouble. It's heading south faster than anyone anticipated, but instead, you flip on CNBC and the geniuses are talking about World War III, and they're not the only ones. So, if you want to know how big this has become, how ominous this is, in the absence of attention from the rest of us, we've kind of slept walked up to this point, you should see this. This is from the city of New York, our largest city. This is a public service announcement reminding the 8 million residents of New York they could soon be nuked.  What? Now, if you were drinking beer and that came on TV, you'd think maybe she was giving you advice on what to do if your basement floods or if there was a heat wave. Then you get to the part where she says ""radioactive dust"" and you snap to it. Radioactive dust? You're suggesting that someone might lob a nuclear weapon into our largest city? What? Why the chirpy tone? What the hell are you talking about? How do we get so close to nuclear war that the city of New York is telling me to wash the radioactive dust off my pants? This is total lunacy. This is crazy. Why are we doing this? Because Putin's bad and he's going to take over Belgium? Because nobody has said anything and because the Republican Party has collaborated with the nutcases in the Biden administration, we have reached the point where some chirpy lady on TV is telling you to prepare for the deaths of tens of millions of Americans.

408	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-fossil-fuels-make-us-rich-country-biden-doesnt-care	2022-07-12 22:40:00	Tucker Carlson: Fossil fuels are the thing that make the US a rich country - but Biden doesn't care | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reveals the potential consequences of the Green New Deal if implemented on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Imagine you went to school with Sandy Cortez. A lot of people did. Imagine it's 2011, and you're both students at Boston University, a not quite prestigious, but highly expensive school for kids who couldn't get into Tufts. You know who Sandy Cortez is because three days a week at 12:20, you see her and your philosophy of gender and sexuality class. She's always there in the front row, snapping her gum and then, like clockwork, she never misses your Queer Theory seminar, which meets every Thursday at 3:30 p.m. because if there's one thing about queer theory scholars, they're not early risers.  Sandy goes to both, and she talks a lot in both classes. She jumps into the conversation whenever she feels she has something important to say, which is frequently. She's hardly a genius, but she is highly self-assured. She's got strong opinions about racism and cosmetics. She seems to spend a lot of time updating her Facebook page. Those are the main things that you remember about Sandy Cortez.  Now, fast forward 10 years. Suddenly, Sandy Cortez is a world-famous figure, somehow. She's calling herself , some kind of female Che, Westchester County's first socialist revolutionary and she's still yammering on about racism and eyeshadow, her twin obsessions and she's still frantically updating her social media pages. Some things have not changed, but other things have changed.   One night you're watching TV and you see Sandy Cortez talking authoritatively about America's energy grid, like she knows a lot about it and that stops you in your tracks. Wait a second. The energy grid, that's an adult thing, right? That's not queer theory. That's real. That's a very complicated piece of infrastructure. Even a lot of engineers don't really understand how the energy grid works. How could Sandy Cortez possibly know anything about that?She can't drive a standard transmission. She can't program a coffeemaker. She doesn't even make her own bed in the morning. The energy grid? Please, it seems preposterous. So, you grab a beer and you settle in to watch her talk about it and your jaw hangs open as you do. Here's what you see.    .  Really? Energy, huh? How is energy generated? Do you know? What's a watt? What's amperage? Speak slowly. We've got time, but she doesn't. Instead, she yells ""the fossil fuel industry and the future of humanity are fundamentally incompatible. They just are. I mean, that's not a political opinion. That's the science.""  Of course it is. That's the science. Whatever I say is the science. There's no debate here. Obey. That's not how Democracy works. Thank God. You actually have to convince people and so she tried. She introduced the Green New Deal three years ago and it didn't go far. In fact, it went nowhere. In fact, virtually nobody in Congress supported it. In fact, when it came time for a vote on the Green New Deal, even her co-sponsor, the other guy who wrote it, the super woke senator from Massachusetts, voted present, not in favor.  Now, why is that? Why did nobody actually support it? Well, because if you think cow flatulence is even in the top 200 top issues for most Americans, you're Sandy Cortez. Go back to queer theory class. Get rid of fossil fuels? Yeah. What then? Well, starvation, poverty, societal collapse. Voters, it turns out, are not into any of those things and so nothing that resembles the Green New Deal is going to pass the United States Congress in our lifetimes, provided this remains an actual democracy, which is to say, provided the public has anything to say about how they're governed.  That's a nonstarter here. It's never going to happen by democratic means, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. It doesn't mean that ideologues can't impose the Green New Deal on weaker countries that are too poor to refuse it and over the past several years, that's exactly what they've done.   So, the Green New Deal is actually taking effect around the world. So, we don't have to guess what would happen if it took effect here. We can know. That's science. Let's start with Ghana. Ghana's a pretty little country, peaceful place, actually, on the west coast of Africa. Three years ago, Ghana was in great shape. It had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In fact, it had so much energy over most of the last decade, it was exporting it to its neighbors in West Africa.  Now, those energy exports from Ghana peaked in 2014. Why that year? Well because the next year, the World Bank published this headline on its website, ""World Bank approves largest-ever guarantees for Ghana's Energy Transformation."" Oh, when they promise to transform your energy, slow down.But Ghana didn't slow down. They just kept going. The World Bank promised to provide, and we're quoting, ""technical assistance for energy sector reforms and the drafting of a new renewable energy law."" So, in return for all this help, Ghana agreed to limit its carbon emissions, and then they entered the Paris climate agreement. Oh, how virtuous. What happened next? This is the part you don't read that much about. Last year, Ghana experienced a complete shutdown of its national power supply. No more electricity, no emissions, because we have no electricity, and blackouts have continued since then. Just yesterday, a news source in Ghana reported that, ""Residents in parts of the Ashanti region who have been hit with power cuts are without water as well,"" because it turns out you need electricity to provide water also to grow food. Now, this is not a small thing. The Ashanti region has millions of people living in it. They're all now living in the Stone Age and it's not just the energy grid that's now compromised in Ghana.  International observers say the country is now facing severe food shortages and hunger, starvation within a matter of months. Why is that? It's a fertile country, hardworking people. Now they're running out of fertilizer. Why? Well, because for years, Sandy Cortez's friends in the NGO community pushed Ghana toward less efficient, more expensive organic fertilizers and the government of Ghana, because it's not a rich government, caved. Last year, according to Ghana's news service, Ghana's agricultural minister, ""urged local farmers to adopt an organic agriculture system to reduce the impact of climate change."" Oh, what happened then? Well, the good people of Ghana, while they feel good about their , are now starving and in June, last month, police in Ghana used water and tear gas to attack hundreds of demonstrators in Accra, which is the capital of Ghana.  It's not just Ghana. The same thing just happened in Sri Lanka. In 2016, the World Economic Forum published an article by a Columbia professor called Joseph Stiglitz, one of the dumbest people on planet Earth, urging Ghana to transition to ""high productivity, organic farming."" Now, what does Stiglitz know about farming? Ever farmed? No, but he felt strongly that Sri Lanka should try a new kind of farming and of course sold it to Sri Lankans as a pathway to prosperity.   In 2015, the World Economic Forum published an article on its website entitled and we are quoting, ""This is how we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025."" You can search for that article, but it's gone now along with the government of Sri Lanka. So, they had an actual insurrection, not January 6, not a guy in horns, in a bearskin, running around on mushrooms, making weird noises. No, an actual insurrection where they like, come to your house and swim in your swimming pool, root through your sock drawer and make you leave. That's what they did to the people who run Sri Lanka. They, being the public.  The turning point came in 2021 when the president of Sri Lanka, acting on advice from the World Economic Forum, banned the use and importation of chemical fertilizers. Now, the problem was virtually every farm in Sri Lanka uses those fertilizers to produce food, which it turns out people need every day in order to survive. As a result of that move, food prices in Sri Lanka nearly doubled. Millions more Sri Lankans now live in poverty, which is not a joke and because the economy has collapsed, Sri Lanka now cannot afford fuel imports. So, Sri Lankans are now waiting days for gasoline. Watch.  What's so interesting is millions of people are now really suffering. The government just fell in Sri Lanka. Now, no one in Sri Lanka is White. They are what our Democratic Party would call people of color and yet the American intellectuals who pushed that disaster in Sri Lanka, who are responsible for the suffering there, have escaped all culpability. No one is saying a word about it. Meanwhile, a cop in Minneapolis was rough with a convicted felon two years ago and we have to stop everything and send him to prison for life, but Joseph Stiglitz is totally fine and it's not just happening, by the way, in the Third World. It's happening even in rich countries. The Netherlands, for example, which is a very rich country, the second-biggest food exporter in the world, tried to do, for reasons that are not clear but may have to do with Western guilt, the same thing that leaders in Sri Lanka tried to do. They just ordered farmers to cut virtually all of their nitrogen oxide emissions to ""save the environment."" Now, doing that would shutter most farms in the Netherlands and destroy the country's food supply and once again, that led to riots. So, everything that's happened in Sri Lanka and Ghana and the Netherlands is happening at the behest not simply of ideologues, but of some of the largest financial institutions in the world.   They want more of this. It's why Ghana has achieved a near-perfect ESG environmental impact score of 97.7. According to World Economic Research, Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1, the Netherlands 90.7. So, the poorer you get, the more human suffering there is, the higher your ESG score and that's important because companies will not invest unless you have a high ESG score. Interesting. So, these countries have no choice and that's why South Africa, for example, works so hard to get an ESG score that now totals 91. Now, that effort began in 2015 when South Africa switched to renewables. Now, how did that work? Well, like everything in South Africa, no one in America really wants to know. It's their favorite country. It's a huge success. What's life like in South Africa for people of all colors? Shh, stop. Well, the Guardian, of all places reported at the time, and we are quoting ""solar, biomass and wind energy systems are popping up all over the country and feeding the clean energy into the strained electrical grid."" So, their grids have been falling apart since 1994, but no problem. The green energy geniuses are going to save South Africa. How did that work? Well, seven years later, The Washington Post reports that South Africa regularly experiences ""rolling blackouts that last 8 hours or more, crippling economic activity and disrupting life in this nation of 60 million people,"" and that's true. Ask anyone who lives there. It's falling apart. Doesn't work.   Also join France. France is committed to renewable energy. How's that working? Well, France currently has an ESG environmental score of 92.6. Why? Because 10 years ago, France pledged to drive a quarter of all of its energy from renewables in 2018. These policies led to riots. Remember the so-called yellow jackets? People didn't like it. If you cared about democracy, you would listen to them, but no one in charge actually does, so they don't and things have gotten worse since then. This past June, the heads of three French energy companies called on the public to ""immediately reduce consumption of fuel, oil, electricity and gas amid shortages and soaring prices."" Oh, stop civilization. It doesn't work. That same month, France's president publicly begged Joe Biden to start producing more oil because the Saudis cannot make enough to supply Europe. Watch. So only the Europeans have been dumb enough to embrace this. Unlike Ghana, they could afford not to, but they are anyway out of some weird sense of collective guilt. So, what's happening throughout Europe? In the UK, ESG score of 92.7, the National Infrastructure Commission has warned that as many as 6 million households could face power cuts this summer. Sound like the First World? No, it doesn't, but that's England now. In Germany, ESG score 90.2. The government is now rationing hot water due to an ongoing gas crisis. Officials in Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, just warned that ""warm water could only be made available at certain times of the day in an emergency."" Now, just a few years ago, that Germany's government laughed at warnings from Donald Trump that this would happen. It's on video. ""Yeah, they are so stupid. You have no idea. Green energy is the future.""   Every place that's been tried has fallen apart. Every single one with no exceptions—Albania, Kenya, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Libya, so on, but it's not just a problem there. It's becoming a problem here. So, the United States are ESG scoring in environmental issues currently stands at 58, but Joe Biden, who buys into every stupid trend, wants to change that. It's very important to get our ESG score up because we want to be more like Ghana. So, at the very moment that Biden is sending our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which we own, he doesn't to his son's business partners in China, he is vowing to end fossil fuels in this country and boost our ESG score. Watch.   So, let's just be really clear. Fossil fuels aren't just not bad. Fossil fuels aren't just a net good. Fossil fuels are the only thing that stands between the United States becoming Ghana. Fossil fuels are the only thing that make the United States a rich country and not a poor country. We have the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. If we can't tap those, we will be Ghana. We will be poor, but Joe Biden doesn't care and so he is clamping down on our ability to extract them and like the leaders of every other country, driven into the ground by green energy schemes thought up by morons like Sandy Cortez, he's taking no responsibility for the damage he has caused.  .  Problem is, he doesn't know anything about refining or extracting or how the grid works or anything about anything because he's never had a real job because he's work for the federal government since he was in his twenties. None of these people have any experience doing anything. Again, most of them can't drive in manual transmission. So, to get a lecture on the power grid or energy from people who have no idea what it is a bit much and the topic is too important to continue to listen to their nonsense as we become poorer. And by the way, as the rift just beneath the surface in American society are exacerbated by that poverty, as GDP drops, societal tension rises. It's dangerous.   Back off and it's accelerated. In the past year, the United States has experienced blackouts in some of our biggest states. Why? Because they're relying more and more on renewables, places like California and even Texas. Just yesterday, in order to avoid a blackout, the largest grid operator in the state of Texas, begged residents to turn up their thermostats, no more AC for you and ask them not to use any major appliances, really, in Texas, which is the largest oil and gas reserves in the continental United States.   What are they doing in Texas? But across the country, this is true. Orlando, Florida recently experiment with fertilizer bans to ""curb pollution."" So, the World Economic Forum wants a lot more of this. They just released a position paper calling for countries to ""agree to end the underpricing of fossil fuels, which is the principal factor preventing a clean energy transition."" In other words, it's too cheap. It works too well. Gas needs to be higher so you won't be able to use it. So, you'll have to be poor. And they're saying this as we're watching countries around the world – we can give you more detail, you see the point – are collapsing and entering into a state of revolution because these morons tampered with their energy grids. But they don't care. They're going to continue doing it unless someone stops them until exactly the same thing happens here. That's true.  "	reveals potential consequences Green Deal implemented Imagine school Sandy Cortez Imagine 2011 students Boston University quite prestigious highly expensive school kids Tufts Sandy

411	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hunter-biden-business-dealings-china-joe-biden	2022-07-11 23:30:00	Tucker Carlson reacts to Hunter Biden's business dealings: Whatever helps China, Joe Biden has dutifully done | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on Hunter Biden's questionable business dealings and reveals why China has power over President Biden on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'We told you about this on Friday night and then over the weekend, we put it into some context. So, we will summarize the story for you once more. Last summer, a group of American intelligence analysts working for the U.S. government issued a report on the . They've been asked to and they did. These people work at CIA, NSA, a bunch of other agencies, and they concluded that the coronavirus may very well have been manufactured in a lab by the Chinese military. Turns out, that's not a talk radio conspiracy theory. As a factual matter, it's a very real possibility, and if it's true, if that's what happened and again, many highly informed people believe that's exactly what happened, that would mean the Chinese government is responsible for killing millions of people around the world and would also raise questions, obvious questions about motive. Why would China unleash a deadly virus on the globe? To the American mind, that is an unimaginable thing to do, but the Chinese government thinks very differently from the way that we think, and here's why.  America has been the dominant power in the world for more than 100 years, since the end of the First World War, when Europe destroyed itself. Empires destroying themselves always pave way for new empires, something we should keep in mind at the moment. So, American attitudes about everything are shaped by generations of casual affluence. We're in charge and we always will be in charge. That's what all of us assume. But the Chinese government does not assume this about us or them.  Until fairly recently, China was a poor country. There are still millions of living Chinese who remember seeing their neighbors starve to death during famines. As a result of that experience, China is very aggressive and very ambitious in ways that your average State Department official from Bethesda could not begin to comprehend. So, would a government like that use COVID as a bioweapon? Well, why wouldn't it?   The coronavirus reshuffled the global order. It crushed the American economy. It made China preeminent. If China takes over the world and that appears to be coming, COVID will be one of the main reasons it was able to. So, by definition, you would think we would want to know where COVID came from. That's a meaningful question, but Joe Biden doesn't want to know. He ignored the report he ordered. He ignored the findings of his own intelligence agencies. That's bizarre when you think about it and if you think that's weird, how about this?  This February, Biden canceled a counter-espionage program called the China Initiative. Now, the point of that program was stopping the rampant threat of our national security secrets by the government of China. But the White House decided to very little fanfare that somehow that program was racist and therefore it had to end. That means the Chinese government can now spy and steal with impunity. Not since Franklin Roosevelt colluded with Joseph Stalin has an American president done anything like that, but Joe Biden didn't hesitate. And then he kept doing things like this. Now, Biden says he plans to end tariffs against China, tariffs that Donald Trump put in place and that China has been complaining about ever since. And not only is Joe Biden ending tariffs against China, Joe Biden's Justice Department has just arrested the man responsible for those tariffs. His name is Peter Navarro.  He was the most effective China hawk in the Trump administration. Last month, Peter Navarro was handcuffed at a Washington, D.C. airport and dragged to jail in leg irons. Why? Supposedly because of January 6, but Peter Navarro had literally nothing to do with January 6. He wasn't even there, but Joe Biden didn't stop there. Steve Bannon was the other notable voice in the Trump administration, warning about the growing power and malicious intent of the Chinese government. In November of last year, Steve Bannon was also arrested by the Biden Justice Department, also on absurd pretexts. So, take a step back. What's the message here? Well, it's unmistakable. Don't criticize the Chinese government, or we will throw you in jail.  Now, if you happen to be watching all this from Beijing, as Chinese leaders definitely have been, you would be applauding. Joe Biden just arrested your loudest critics. How gratifying is that? Things are going well for you. You already control Canada, whose brain dead, prime minister is effectively a Chinese lackey. Now the most powerful country in the world is doing exactly what you want it to do. You'd be thrilled by this. You'd be especially thrilled to see Joe Biden destroy America's single greatest asset, which is its domestic energy supply, and make the United States entirely dependent on Chinese technology for wind and solar projects. If you're the Chinese government, this is the masterstroke. This is the checkmate. Once you control a country's energy grid, you control that country. And you would know that because you didn't go to Yale Law School and you know something about reality as a result and by the way, if you're watching all this from Beijing, you would find it especially amusing to have the president of the United States sell you his country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even as he declared oil and gas off-limits to his own population.  If you could pull that off, you would know you were entirely in charge of the U.S. government. You could make Joe Biden do anything, but of course you already knew that because you've seen it in action. When American forces left Afghanistan, Joe Biden turned over Afghanistan's entire mineral wealth, which is vast, to the Chinese government. That would include gold and coal and oil and gas, lithium, rare earth minerals, resources the United States needs to make smartphones, automobiles, power our energy grid. But Joe Biden handed all of that to the government of China, and then he kept going.  Biden also dropped the Trump administration's efforts to ban Chinese surveillance programs that poses social media apps. That means WeChat and TikTok. Then Biden approved licenses for Huawei, which is controlled by the Chinese government, to buy auto chips. That gives the Chinese government even deeper control over the automotive supply chain in this country, one of our last manufacturing sectors. And then as a humiliating flourish, a deep and groveling kowtow, Joe Biden signed a so-called climate pledge with China.   China will ignore this pledge, obviously, they already are ignoring it, but we will take the pledge seriously because that's the kind of country we are and that pledge will further cripple our domestic energy production because that's what it was designed to do. It's all pretty amazing when you think about it, when you put it in context. Whatever helps the Chinese government, Joe Biden has dutifully done. Whatever hurts America's most important strategic interests, he has also done. But why is he done this? How did the Chinese government wind up with so much control over the United States president, over Joe Biden's behavior?  We've been mulling that for more than a year and that's why since October of 2020, we have been on the  because that seems like the key to this question: how the Chinese government got so much control over Joe Biden. Now the tech companies have tried to censor that story at every turn. They're doing so again tonight and it's not surprising why. They're beholden to China as well, but we've continued to pull those threads; so has the Daily Mail.  In April, the Daily Mail reported that a whistleblower was in possession of 450 gigabytes of deleted material from . The whistleblower's name is Jack Maxey. He'd gone to Switzerland, fearing retaliation. We wanted to know more so in April, we flew to Zurich to meet Jack Maxey. Here's part of what he told us.   So, you can say what you want about Jack Maxey and you can dismiss him by calling him names. But the story he was telling was really interesting, tantalizing in fact, given what we already knew was on the laptop, but for some reason, no one in law enforcement appeared to be listening or even care. But the Daily Mail kept going on this. Recently, they said they gained access to a backup of Hunter Biden's iPhone from the laptop and it's a good thing they did. It turned out to be a trove of fascinating information. It included a voicemail from Joe Biden to his son talking about a story in The New York Times about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China. Here's part of it.    So, the context for that is complicated. Here's what's not complicated: Joe Biden has said on the record repeatedly that he had no knowledge of his son's business dealings with China. That proves Joe Biden was lying, and we have a lot more on this coming up, but just know that. That voicemail, which apparently is real, proves that Joe Biden knew about his son's business dealings with China. That ought to be enough to spur a wave of media inquiries to the White House. Why didn't you lie to us? You haven't seen that.  Now, the Times piece you just heard Joe Biden reference was published on December 12th, 2018. The story reported on Hunter's dealings with a man called Ye Jianming. He led the CEFC China Energy Company until 2018. At that point, he was arrested on charges of corruption and economic crimes by the Chinese government, which is never a good thing. He hasn't been seen since. The government of China has seized most of CEFC's assets. One of his top deputies called Patrick Ho, was also convicted in New York, of bribing African officials to help Iran avoid oil sanctions. What a group. These are Hunter Biden's business friends.   Why would Joe Biden have any interest in this? Why would he be concerned about a New York Times story on CEFC and Hunter Biden? Well, it could be for the obvious reason. Joe Biden himself was making money from this, from CEFC, lots of money. According to emails obtained by the New York Post from Hunter Biden's laptop in October of 2020, one of Hunter Biden's business partners, James Gilliar explained that Joe Biden would receive a 10% stake in CEFC.  ""The equity will be distributed as follows,"" he wrote, 20 to Hunter, 20 to Rob Walker, 20 to Gilliar himself, 20 to Tony Bobulinski, 10 to Jimmy Biden, that would be the president's brother, and ""10% held for the big guy."" The big guy. So, Tony Bobulinski, whom we interviewed for a full hour, he got a 20% stake of this deal, told us that there was ""no question"" the big guy is who he so obviously is. That would be Joe Biden. This arrangement meant millions of Chinese dollars for Hunter and Joe Biden.  In early 2017, just a few weeks after Biden left the White House, the first time a company controlled by Ye called State Energy HK sent $6 million in wire transfers to Robinson Walker LLC. Robinson Walker LLC was controlled by Rob Walker, one of Hunter Biden's business partners. Then in June of 2017, Hunter Biden emailed Ye demanding $10 million more as seed money for a new company called SinoHawk Holdings.   In August 2017, another Hunter Biden controlled company called Hudson West received a $5 million wire from CEFC. CEFC also paid Hunter Biden's law firm, Owasco, nearly $5 million. These are according to bank records reviewed by Senate investigators and if we just pause here for a moment. In their details, these stories bear a striking resemblance to the Russiagate insanity that we were dragged through for years. Remember, they go on TV and bore you for an hour with how all these things fit together and then this money went that way, but in the end, there was nothing there. Operating on the theory, which isn't really a theory, it's true that they always accuse you of exactly what they themselves are doing. It's kind of striking that the truth about what the Biden family, the president, his son and his brother Jimmy, it's almost exactly what they accused the Trumps of doing, except in the case the Bidens, they really were getting rich from a foreign power that means us harm and it's not Russia which is globally almost irrelevant. It's China, which is now preeminent.  So, to continue with the details, Owasco, in turn, sent the $1.4 million to Lion Hall Consulting. That was a consulting firm run by Jimmy Biden, the former nightclub owner, the president's brother and his wife, and that was just the beginning of the arrangement. Emails unearthed by the New York Post found that someone called the chairman, that would be Ye, promised to pay Hunter Biden $10 million a year, and we're quoting, ""introductions alone."" In other words, leveraging his father's position in government to get rich. That's illegal, right? It's also a violation of the Fara Act, which the Biden administration has been enforcing against its political enemies. So, Hunter Biden wrote to a CEFC official that Ye had amended the deal to provide for ""a much more lasting and lucrative arrangement."" These payments continued even after CEFC's leaders were arrested on corruption charges. Hunter was paid another $1 million to represent Ye's deputy, Patrick Ho even though he had no criminal defense experience because he was a lawyer, because he went to Yale Law School, because he's a genius, the one that your kids can't get into because they're not as smart as Hunter Biden.   Well, this is one corrupt system the Bidens sit on top of and if that's not enough, Hunter once referred to Patrick Ho and we're quoting, as the ""f-ing spy chief of China,"" according to leaked audio obtained by RealClearPolitics. Here you have the president's son who is talking to his dad about his business deal with China, admitting the guy he is dealing with is the Chinese government spy chief. It's almost unbelievable. Joe Biden has sort of been asked about this. His response? I didn't know anything. Watch.  Oh, you lie, and now you've been caught lying. So, after the voicemail we played a moment ago, surfaced a few weeks ago proving that Biden lied, the White House was asked about this, not the president directly, but his publicist, the glass ceiling breaking publicist they are always bragging about. Watch the response.   But secondly, secondly....   ""Alleged materials."" So, they can get away with that because no major news organization in the United States picked up the thread. We tried to. We are a talk show. We flew to Zurich because we thought, ""Wow, maybe there's something there,"" but the big newspapers completely ignored this, even though it's been out there for a year and a half and it's obvious it's not just about Joe Biden being a crackhead who likes hookers. It's about the Biden family, including the president of the United States' business dealings with the government of China, which seeks to displace the United States globally.  So, because no news organizations would take this up and because law enforcement agencies seem completely uninterested, the FBI has had a copy of this laptop for years now and done nothing with it. It's fallen to people like Jack Maxey to find out what this is about. So, on Sunday, a programmer who worked with Maxey, he posted a livestream video outlining his intention of dropping Hunter Biden's entire hard drive online, along with clues for users to break into the iPhone and iPad backups. He put it on 4Chan, which is some sort of website that basically not very moderated and it's kind of website of last resort for people who want to get information out there but can't because everything is so completely censor at this point.  Even on 4Chan, the moderators quickly took these links down, but internet users are already seeding the contents of the backups on torrent sites. Bottom line: this is going to live online forever. It's not going away. Now, was it real? We have no reason to believe any of these data are fabricated. We've not independently verified them. We're not putting some of this stuff on the air. It's salacious, but it's pretty obvious that the materials we've looked at are real. At the same time, it's becoming clear that Maxey and his former coders are the only two people making any progress in investigating Hunter Biden's criminal activity. Again, the FBI has done nothing since obtaining the hard drive years ago. Meanwhile, it's raiding people's houses because they (what?) supported Trump in the last election? And the tech companies, as always, are on board, on China's side, once again, censoring any discussion of Hunter Biden's activities, criminal activity, some of which are on video and if you don't believe it, try yourself.   Type in ""Hunter Biden weighing crack on a scale"" which is out there. Type it into Google and see what happens. You'll get obscure results from random YouTube channels. When you click on Google's news tab, nothing from an American media publication appears. They're stepping on the scale. They're censoring information, as they have from the very beginning. Why are they doing that? Because it matters, that's why. It's not about whether Biden was a druggie. Yeah, he was with a screwed up personal life and a weird personal life. Yeah, knew that. That's not what it's about. They're not protecting Hunter Biden. They're protecting this administration, and they're trying prevent you from understanding this administration's posture toward China.  Among the latest findings, as reported by Andrew Kerr at The Washington Examiner, are that, ""Joe Biden wired $100,000 to Hunter Biden during the same time frame Hunter Biden spent over $30,000 on Russian escorts who may very well be linked to an Eastern European human trafficking ring."" That's a lot like that, but again, the real story is not that Hunter Biden is a crackhead who liked prostitutes and underage girls, although that appears to be very true and law enforcement should look into it,. But for the rest of us, that's not the real story. The real story is that the Biden family was getting rich from business with our enemies. They were selling access to the US government to China and that is a crime. It's certainly a moral crime. As recently as 2020, Joe Biden denied that he or his family had made any money from China. Watch this.   So, you spent so much time noting Joe Biden's creeping senility that you can overlook the fact that in his lucid moments he's a liar, just flat-out liar. That's a lie. In fact, it's a lie so obvious even The Washington Post, which has carried water for Biden since the very beginning, had to correct it. According to The Washington Post, ""Over the course of 14 months, the Chinese energy conglomerate"" that would be CEFC ""and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle."" That would be Jimmy Biden, the former nightclub owner. Are these guys experts on energy? What are they experts on? Nothing, leveraging the U.S. government for personal profit. That's it and it's not just CEFC that funded the Bidens.    In all, Hunter Biden made more than $30 million from entities affiliated with China's communist government. Hunter Biden's biggest deal with China involved a Chinese investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST or BHR. In December of 2013, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden flew to Beijing. It was a government trip on a government plane and that's when Hunter introduced his father to a BHR executive. Again, that's a flat-out violation of law. You can't take Air Force Two to China to lobby on behalf of the Chinese government, your own father. Full on time. The Bidens denied it, but Hunter eventually took a 10% stake in that company, a stake worth about $20 million. Then a Chinese company called Harvest Global wired another $5 million to another company controlled by Hunter Biden, this one called Burnham Asset Management. He's got more companies than your average Mafia's done. According to the Washington Free Beacon, Hunter Biden, ""reached out directly to the firm's chairman"" and said the investment and we're quoting ""would be important to the Biden family."" Biden family, including his dad, the vice president, United States. So, what's in it for Harvest Global? Well, per the Free Beacon, ""Biden put together a financial proposal for Burnham to pitch to Harvest that promised 'Washington, D.C., access’ for investors."" They're selling influence, selling influence with the U.S. government. Again, not to Belgium, not to Swaziland, to China, the country that has the United States in its sights.  They want to displace us as the leader of the world, and they will be cruel masters if they're ever able to do that. Hunter Biden also co-founded a firm famously called Rosemont Realty. This is a good one. Rosemont Realty owns commercial buildings all over the United States. Now, a Hong Kong based firm called Gemini Investments later snapped up Rosemont Realty. Gemini was controlled at the time by ""Sino-Ocean Land"" that was chaired by the head of China Ocean Shipping Corp., or COSCO. As Peter Schweizer reported, Japanese government agencies report that ""Chinese intelligence services are closely linked"" to COSCO. Well, of course they are and that's true of all big Chinese companies. It's not like the United States. They don't have independent big businesses in China.   They're all arms of the Chinese government. Now, China's President Xi Jinping has called COSCO and we're quoting, "" the dragon's head for China."" What did Hunter Biden make for doing this? About 180 grand. Now, we know of most of this because of reporting from Hunter Biden's laptop, which now everyone admits is authentic, but for more than a year, you were not allowed to talk about the story and now maybe you understand why. It wasn't protecting the feelings of Hunter Biden's family or making fun of his drug addiction or seeing pictures of him with M&Ms stacked on his private parts, yeah whatever. It was about China and that's why the media portrayed it at the time as a conspiracy theory. Watch. When you look at this computer store owner in Delaware who allegedly received Hunter Biden's laptop, that is more in line when you think about somebody who's a useful idiot, that's kind of the entry point that is kind of, again, a classic indicator of the potential presence of disinformation. Right-wing media has been focused on Hunter Biden, this laptop that intelligence officials have warned is likely Russian disinformation.  Law enforcement is actively investigating whether the alleged Hunter Biden emails are linked to any foreign intel ops.  The story is preposterous. So, we're supposed to believe that Hunter Biden in a drunken stupor, dropped off his laptop and I guess in apparently a QAnon repair office.   So again, having been a rich country for over a hundred years, Americans are not trained to think in geopolitical terms. We're not trained to think in terms of, ""Which country is more powerful than which other country? Who makes the decisions? Who's in charge?"".  That's the way China thinks of everything. And so this story intersects with the single biggest story taking place generationally in the world and that's the rise of China and the decline of the United States and the Biden family participated directly in that shift of power from the United States to China. Now, in 100 years, this will all be very, very obvious. But in the meantime, do not be distracted. This is not about Hunter Biden arguing with a hooker about how much crack is on the scale. This is about our leaders, the Biden family and not just the Biden family, selling out America, including its most precious assets, to the Chinese gove.rnment."	weighs Hunter Biden questionable

414	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-no-group-benefited-more-covid-communist-china	2022-07-08 22:44:00	Tucker Carlson: No group benefited more from COVID than Communist China | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson argues no one benefited more from the COVID pandemic than China on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'A look back for a moment, the  that would be the virus itself, and our government's response to it turns out to have been the single most destructive event to take place in the United States in our lifetime – so destructive that it's going to be many years before we know for certain what the last two and a half years have caused to all of us. But even now, the outlines of it are clear.  COVID crashed our economy first and foremost. GDP fell by the biggest percentage since the Great Depression; 22 million Americans lost their jobs in the first two months of the lockdowns. Remember that? What you may not know is that at least 5 million of them never went back to work. They dropped out of the workforce, apparently for good. At the same time, as fewer people were working thanks to the profligate lunacy of our leaders, our national debt rose by nearly $10 trillion, unprecedented, and along with the debt, our debt to China also rose and then at the level of our society, every bad thing became more common: drug ODs, suicide, illiteracy, crime, all of them skyrocketed. So did obesity, anxiety and alcoholism has been virtually every other marker of social decay.  Marriages and birth rates, meanwhile, dropped, so did church attendance. We could go on, but you know what happened because you live here. And none of that is even counting the deaths from the coronavirus itself. That's a topic that public health authorities have lied about so consistently that we will likely never know what the real number is, but we can be confident the toll was in the hundreds of thousands.  So, on every level, COVID crushed America. Centuries-old traditions just evaporated. It's a different country, and not a better one. But that doesn't mean that everybody suffered under COVID. Countless small businesses went under. That devastated our middle class, but at the same time, thanks to the lockdowns, the tech monopolies thrived. Apple, Google, Amazon all saw their market caps explode. Jeff Bezos wound up much richer than ever before, not that he needed the money. But no group benefited more from the COVID pandemic than the leaders of communist China.   By April of 2021, that would be more than a year into COVID when we are suffering, here in China, the GDP had reached the highest level ever recorded. China's economy was growing faster after the pandemic than it had been before the pandemic and as a result of that, China will soon overtake the United States as the world's dominant economy soon. Now, if someone had predicted that you ten years ago, you would have laughed. It would have seemed ridiculous, but that was before COVID. Now it's real and COVID made it possible.  In other words, the  didn't simply change the United States. The coronavirus changed the balance of power in the world forever. So, when you think of COVID that way, and that's the way the people who run governments think about it, trust us, when you think of it that way, it becomes pretty obvious that this was more than an overhyped public health emergency. In fact, it may very well have been a crime, the greatest crime in history. Was it? It's hard to think of a more important question, and yet our leaders seem curiously uninterested in answering it.  Shortly after Joe Biden took office, he ordered the intel agencies to determine where COVID came from and the report he got back stunned him. It was inconclusive. There are two theories, of course. One is that COVID came from a lab leak in Wuhan. The other was it came from a pangolin or some kind of animal. Here's what the Intel agency said. ""The majority of elements within the Intel community do not believe there's sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.""  That may seem like not a big deal to you, but if you're the Democratic Party, if you spent a year dismissing any talk of a lab leak as a racist conspiracy theory, this was stunning because it suggested that actually the CIA thought it was entirely possible that the Chinese government manufactured coronavirus. So, in May of last year, Joe Biden publicly, very publicly, sent that report back to the intel agencies and told them to, ""redouble their efforts to find out where COVID came from,"" and he gave them a deadline of 90 days. In August, the report arrived. It was just a page and a half long, but it was more conclusive: ""one IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory associated incident probably involving experimentation, animal handling or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" Now, that should have been a running headline for months after. It wasn't. It almost immediately disappeared, but think about what they're saying. A lot of people in the intel community believe this came from a lab, not on talk radio, people who work at the CIA. And there are a lot of reasons to think they're right. State Department officials had visited that lab in Wuhan back in 2018, and according to The Washington Post, ""they sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronavirus from bats."" Then it turns out one of the biggest funders of the Wuhan lab, a man called Peter Daszak, who received millions in grants from Tony Fauci, boasted about manipulating  right before the pandemic began. Remember this?    That's an incredibly incriminating piece of tape and yet that man, Peter Daszak, has not been hauled before a congressional committee. Has the CIA spoken to him? There's no evidence that they have. It looks to be that the experiments he was conducting, in part with American tax dollars, may have led to the destruction of the U.S. economy and millions of deaths.  The Times of London reported that a virus 96% identical to the Wuhan coronavirus had been found in an abandoned copper mine in China in 2012. That virus was collected in 2013 and then stored and studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And then on this show, we spoke to a Chinese virologist who says she was at the scene who said that COVID originated from a lab experiment. All of this was taking place in public. Our intel agencies could not deny it, but in their report, they gave Joe Biden an out.  In the report that was not even two pages long, they said that in order to reach a definitive conclusion about where the virus came from, we would need the help from the government of China. And of course, the intel agencies knew we would never get that help. ""China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19.""   So, if you're the Biden administration, and you really wanted to know where COVID came from, that line would justify putting immense pressure on the government of China to hand over the answers so we could find out what the hell just happened, but Joe Biden didn't do that. A few months after the Intel Community second report came out, a reporter asked Joe Biden,"" Why haven't you followed up on the recommendation and pressured the government of China to answer basic questions about where COVID came from?"" And you may remember this, or maybe you've never seen it before. Here's Biden's response. He just smiled and walked away.  He just smiled and walked away and no one followed up. There was no outrage in the United States Congress. No one in the media yelled at him for that. It was clear that Joe Biden had zero interest in finding out where the virus came from and whether or not China was involved now. Why is that? Well, the Chinese government has made Joe Biden's family extraordinarily rich, richer than we knew. In fact, we learned from the Washington Free Beacon that the Biden administration has sent a million barrels of oil from our, not belonging to him, but to us, the American people, our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a Chinese owned energy company that Hunter Biden has invested in.   Remember they used to tell you that the Trump kids were so corrupt? All of them got poorer after four years of the Trump administration. But not Joe Biden's son. But it's not just Biden and his administration that has ignored China's potential involvement in creating COVID. The media are not interested either. Why is that? Well, keep in mind, the government of China pays American media a lot of money in an exchange, why not ignore what could be the crime of the century? In recent years, China has spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising in American newspapers. That would include The New York Times and maybe that's why the New York Times' COVID reporter Apoorva Mandavilli sent out this tweet last year, ""Someday we will stop talking about the lab leak theory and maybe even admit its racist roots. But alas, that date is not yet here."" So, it was racist to ask whether the outbreak of a global pandemic in Wuhan might be related to the Chinese government lab in Wuhan that was experimenting on a version of the same virus. Yeah, that was racist, but the entire media took that posture throughout the pandemic. Note that it's a foreign virus, which it is, and you're a racist.   These people, they're stupid and they're dishonest, but it's more than that. Where did this talking point come from? It's racist to point out that COVID came from China. Well, this talking point became prevalent in March of 2020 and it just so happens that's exactly when China's state-owned media tweeted that terms like Wuhan coronavirus were racist. Before China's government issued that order, our media here in the United States didn't recognize the term Wuhan coronavirus as a slur. In fact, they themselves said it constantly. Here's the proof.       Those clips are all from February of 2020. Chinese media tells them that the term Chinese coronavirus, Wuhan coronavirus, those are racist terms. So, the American media immediately declares that those are racist terms. They're taking their orders directly from Chinese state media. Are you surprised? They aren't we interested in finding out where the COVID virus came from, but we're interested in the topic, and it turns out there's a lot of very interesting information that the intel community somehow left out of its page and a half long report.  We're going to start in May of 2021. That's when Joe Biden ordered the intel community to assess this, but we're going to include information that they left out. Here it is. On May 5 of 2021, a former New York Times science reporter called Nicholas Wade wrote in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists a review of something called the ""furin cleavage site"" of the virus. That's something that increases the viral infectivity of human cells. His analysis included this quote from David Baltimore who is a virologist and former president of the California Institute of Technology ""When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence with its, arginine codons, I said to my wife, it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARs2."" In other words, when I look carefully at the virus, I realized it was manmade and then later in May, 18 prominent scientists published a letter in the journal Science saying a new investigation was needed because ""theories of accidental release from the lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.""  Keep in mind, this is how scientists write, but the headline is actually the lab leak theory might not be a theory. Now, among the people who signed that letter was Ralph Baric. He's a virologist in the United States who works closely with Shi Zhengli. That's the infamous ""bat lady"" from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If Ralph Baric's name seems familiar to you, it's because that name was in many internal emails that we now have seen from inside the National Institutes of Health. Those emails came out in June of 2021 and in those emails, we learn that in the earliest days of the pandemic, researchers warned Tony Fauci that the virus appeared to come from the lab, that it wasn't natural, it was manmade.   Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California, wrote this: ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (< 0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features potentially look engineered."" It's just the very beginning. People who are looking through microscopes at the virus said to themselves, ""Wait a second. Someone made this."" The emails also show that Tony Fauci demanded information for a gain-of-function experiments from subordinates, particularly gain-of-function experiments in Wuhan. Fauci then sent an urgent email to his deputy, a man called Hugh Auchincloss. The subject of that email is in all caps and it was: ""IMPORTANT"" quote ""Hugh, it is essential that we speak this a.m. Keep your cell phone on. Read this paper as well as the email that I will forward. You will have tasks today that must be done."" Fauci then attached to document the email mail titled ""Baric, Shi, et all- Nature Medicine- SARS Gain and function.pdf."" Now, keep in mind that Tony Fauci denied under oath that Ralph Baric, a researcher in the United States, had ever conducted gain-of-function research in Wuhan and yet here was Tony Fauci emailing his subordinates about Ralph Baric’s work with Wuhan's bat lady, who was the person conducting infamous experiments on bat coronaviruses that may have changed the global order, that may have caused this pandemic and put China ahead of the United States and therefore in charge of the world   Now, around the same time, the emails show the director of the NIH, the now completely discredited Francis Collins, was trying to bury the lab leak theory. Collins wanted his underlings to find, ""something NIH can do to help put down this very destructive conspiracy."" Now, keep in mind, Francis Collins at the very same time was running around telling everyone what a great Christian he was and doing all these interviews with the evangelical websites, telling people to listen to what Tony Fauci was saying, believe the U.S. government.  ""No, the lab leak theory is ridiculous. Get the vax."" That was Francis Collins. Well, it turns out he was lying, but none of this made it into the Intel agency's one-and-a-half-page report to Joe Biden. Neither did the news that the Wuhan lab spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new filtration system shortly after the pandemic began. Really? On September 16, 2019, nearly three months after the first reported cases of COVID-19 emerged, the Wuhan lab agreed to spend $606 million on a ""central air conditioning renovation project."" $606 million. That's a lot for HVAC.  So, in the face of all of this evidence, which at this point is overwhelming, the World Health Organization, of all places, is demanding a new investigation into the origins of COVID. Keep in mind, W.H.O. rigged the last investigation by making Peter Daszak the sole U.S. investigator, but officials in this country, for reasons we can't understand, are still resisting efforts to find out what was happening at the Wuhan lab with, by the way, the support of U.S. taxpayer.   Now, what's the Wuhan lab up to now? Well, it may come as a surprise to you that at the Wuhan lab, they're now working on monkey pox viruses. In fact, they're more than working on monkey pox viruses. They're assembling new monkey pox viruses. According to one study underway at this moment, ""since MPXV infection"" (what would be monkey pox) ""has never been associated with an outbreak in China, the viral genomic material required for qPCR detection is unavailable,"" and therefore the lab has to engage in ""viral DNA recombination's"" creating a fragment of the virus from the ground up, which they call a ""fail safe."" In other words, Frankenstein c--- with monkey pox. Amazing. In the face of all of this, the White House has buried any real investigation into the origins of COVID and so this research is allowed to continue, research that could make COVID look like nothing. No one's saying anything about this. So, tonight we want to talk to someone who has not been in lock step, someone who from the very beginning has been brave enough to point to the most obvious origin of COVID and that would be the lab in Wuhan and that man's name is Steven Mosher. We first talked to him in February of 2020.   Steven Mosher was the first person we heard say that. Very few honest people would disagree at this point. "	argues benefited COVID pandemic China look back moment virus government response turns single destructive event take place United States lifetime

417	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-self-defense-cornerstone-liberty	2022-07-07 22:20:00	Tucker Carlson: Self-defense is the cornerstone of all liberty | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the rise in crime and the right to self defense on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'Good evening and welcome to ""."" Here's a story that tells you a lot. Last Friday, a 35-year-old convicted felon called Austin Simon walked into a neighborhood convenience store in Harlem in New York City and pushed his way behind the counter. Austin's girlfriend had just had a dispute with the clerk in the store. The clerk was a 61-year-old Dominican immigrant called Jose Alba.  The woman wanted a bag of potato chips, but there was no money left on her government issued food stamp card, so the clerk tried to take back the chips. The woman became enraged and went and got her boyfriend. Now, the boyfriend, Austin Simon, had a long history of violent crime. Simon has spent at least three years in prison for assault. His most recent parole expired last May.  Though Simon had no apparent job, he was wearing a $300 designer T-shirt and a gold earring, and he was extremely angry. He was furious. Austin Simon threw Alba into a wall, then leaned down and screamed in his face. When the older man stood up, Simon grabbed him by the neck. Here's a local news account describing what happened next.   Alba was 61, by the way, he's every bit as old as he looks. Now Simon died. Every death is sad, but at the same time, decent people can acknowledge that some deaths are much sadder than others and Austin Simon's death is not one of those. Simon was a thug. He was a taker. He was a cruel and vicious bully. Austin Simon was the sort of person who beats up old men simply because he can. Functional societies have zero tolerance for people like Austin Simon because people like Austin Simon hurt the weak and prevent the productive from producing.  They themselves contribute nothing. They are, in fact, the mirror image of men like Jose Alba. Jose Alba came to the United States 30 years ago to work, and working is exactly what he was doing at the bodega in Harlem and almost midnight on Friday, selling chips to people who don't bother to work, holding up the retail economy for minimum wage. A healthy society celebrates, venerates men like Jose Alba, men with jobs and families, men with independence and dignity and above all, a healthy society affirms the right of men like this to self-defense.  Self-defense is the cornerstone of all liberty. If you can't defend your own life and property, you have no rights at all. That was obvious in America for centuries. This was a country whose leaders encouraged decent behavior, who held up the common man as a hero, but that has changed. Jose Alba wasn't lauded for his bravery or his resourcefulness. He wasn't congratulated for defending himself in the face of a violent felon much younger than him. Though every single normal person who watched that video on social media applauded, every single one, and yet Alba was arrested at the scene and he was sent to jail.  An openly racist Soros-backed prosecutor called Alvin Bragg, then charged Jose Alba with felony murder. He sent to Rikers Island, a jail famous among Democrats because it's so squalid and so dangerous that they have spent decades trying to shut it down, but it wasn't so bad they didn't send Jose Alba there and then Bragg set his bail at a quarter of $1,000,000—$250,000 in a city that very recently was considering getting rid of all bail.  Compare that to the bail of other violent criminals. Now, a judge later lowered that bond to $50,000, but the message that Bragg sent was very clear to everyone watching and it was this: If the criminal who assaults you is a member of a favored group, you don't have the right to fight back. You may not defend yourself. You must take whatever he gives you because thugs have more rights than you do, you being the person dumb enough to be working in almost midnight in a bodega in Harlem on a Friday. That's the message and it wasn't simply Alvin Bragg who was sending it.  The tech companies, as always, joined with government as a unified force to send this message. GoFundMe deleted Jose Alba's fundraising page from the Internet. Contrast this with how the left's militia are treated. Now, GoFundMe explained we don't allow fundraising for anyone who's been charged with a violent crime. Really? Well, that's just a lie and provably so. BLM rioters were encouraged to raise money for bail and their legal defense. They can have lawyers, but not bodega clerks. They are powerless and they must remain so. So, GoFundMe openly encouraged rioting in the name of George Floyd on behalf, in effect, of Joe Biden two years ago, but Jose Alba, they shut his family down in hours.   So, who made this decision specifically? We should know their names. GoFundMe is a company. Here's who runs it. Tim Cadogan is the CEO of GoFundMe. Juan Benitez is the president. You're seeing their pictures right there. The chief corporate affairs officer at GoFundMe is called Margaret Richardson. These are the people who made this decision to crush Jose Alba and his family, but they're not the only ones. Virtually every power center in the United States agrees that self-defense is no longer allowed. You can no longer fight back and if you don't believe it, remember how the media covered the Rittenhouse trial. ""He carried a gun across state lines. He's a White supremacist."" Here was a man exercising his lawful, his fundamental right of self-defense, but he was charged with murder and corporate media backed the prosecutors. During Rittenhouse's trial, one prosecutor called James Kraus told the jury openly that Rittenhouse should have just allowed the thugs to beat him to death.  He had no right to defend himself, ""Everyone takes a beating sometimes,"" Kraus says, a man who's never taken a beating in his life, and then another prosecutorial call called Thomas Binger, declared that if you own a gun, you are effectively waiving your right to defend yourself. Watch.  So, there's the closing arguments in Wisconsin during the Rittenhouse trial. You lose the right to self-defense when you're the one who brought the gun. Now, legally, that is nonsense. It's insane. There's no reference point whatsoever in American law for that statement, but the law is not the point. They don't need the law. They now have the unilateral authority to destroy your business, ruin your reputation, throw you in prison, prevent your family from hiring a lawyer to defend you or get you out of jail.    You saw that happen in St Louis when another Soros-backed D.A., this one called Kim Gardner, targeted the McCloskey family. Now the McCloskeys were sitting having dinner outside their house bothering nobody in Saint Louis when a mob out of nowhere came to the gate, broke the gate, stormed their property and threatened them.  So, they went inside and got their legally retained firearms and displayed them. They didn't shoot anybody. It was their property. They held up their guns and said, ""Get off our land, stop threatening us."" What did these Soros-backed prosecutor do? Charge the McCloskeys with felonies.   Another Soros-backed prosecutor. Now you have to wonder, why would a Hungarian currency trader be interested in spending untold millions and millions and millions of dollars to invert our justice system, to put the state on the side of the lawless, to put prosecutors on the side of the criminal against the law abiding?  What source is interested in doing that? It's clearly working and what gives him the right to change our ancient justice system? None of the media asked that question. Instead, they celebrated the days that he installed. Kim Gardner was celebrated by the news media. As CBS 60 Minutes reporting gleefully Gardner, ""stopped locking up nonviolent offenders, dropped low level drug cases and ended cash bail."" Right.  What 60 Minutes didn't tell you is that under Gardner's tenure, the city recorded its highest per capita murder rate in over half a century. Many more people died. Died. And not just in Saint Louis and not just in New York and not just in Baltimore, Philadelphia, everywhere. Arlington, Virginia, experiencing a significant increase in violent crime this year.   Why? A Soros-backed prosecutor called Parisa Dehghani-Tafti has also prosecuted clear cases of self-defense. You can't defend yourself. The people who are favored by the regime can do whatever they want. You can do nothing to protect your life, your family, your property. Burglars broke into the Arlington Smoke Shop in March of 2020, middle of the night. A store employee who was sleeping in the store because there were so many break ins shot at the robbers, as is his right, in fact his duty and he should be applauded for that, but no, he was prosecuted. We spoke to the store owner about what happened.    So, at this very moment, the Biden administration is letting in millions, literally millions of illegal aliens, foreign nationals whose identities we can't actually know because they work hard, the American Dream, the Statue of Liberty. Give us your tired, huddled masses, etc., etc.. Okay, but then when those immigrants come here and work in a bodega in Harlem or a smoke shop in Arlington and they're faced with violent crime, this same party, the Democratic Party, punishes them for defending themselves.  Whose side are they on exactly? Now, in the Arlington smoke shop case, that prosecution resulted ultimately in an acquittal. Thank God, but what about the employee who was in prison? He spent months in jail. His life was destroyed. Again, the point of this is not just to hurt him, but to send a message to the rest of us. Whether you're in Arlington or Kenosha or Saint Louis or New York City, you do not have the right to self-defense in the United States. This is national policy and Joe Biden has effectively articulated it.  You might remember he delivered his big anti-gun speech shortly after he took office, the one where he declared the Second Amendment isn't ""absolute."" He'll decide what your rights are. Biden did not even mention self-defense a single time and that's because Democrats don't believe it is a right. They've said as much. Here's Claire McCaskill. Some kind of washed up Democratic politician, one of the dumbest senators ever to serve in the body from Missouri, explain on MSNBC why people don't actually need ammunition to shoot at home invaders.    Claire McCaskill will decide how you defend yourself. You don't need seven. How many do we need, Claire McCaskill? Do you know anything at all about anything? Give us a list of the things you know. That would not include anything about firearms. So-called high-capacity magazines don't have 70 rounds and they don't have half of 70 rounds. No one in the Democratic Party knows what a round is anyway. Here's Dick Durbin claiming that people are walking around with clips with multiple pieces of ammunition. Watch the ignorance on display.   They haven't learned. They've been talking about guns for 50 years. They haven't learned a single thing about guns. Why? Because they don't care about guns because it's not actually about guns. It's about power. They make the society far more dangerous than it was three years ago.  They make it far more chaotic than it has ever been in its history. It's their voters doing this and then they tell you there's nothing you can do about it. You can't even defend your own life or the life of your family. That's what they're saying. That's not a reassuring message. It's really ominous. "	weighs rise crime self defense Good story tells Last Friday 35 old convicted felon Austin Simon walked neighborhood convenience store Harlem York City pushed behind counter

750	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-how-long-until-canadian-style-tyranny-comes-to-america	2022-02-15 23:45:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: How long until Canadian-style tyranny comes to America? | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues Canadian prime minister is combating trucker protests through ‘tyranny.’A lot is happening in the news. Here's one item that we noticed:  canceled democracy last night. And the remarkable thing is no one in this country seemed to notice that it happened. There was no outcry from our political class, as their friend  declared martial law in response to an entirely peaceful protest from his country's working class. Our news  barely noted that it happened. Weirdest of all, the , which exists these days to denounce such attackers of democracy as Hungary and Poland, didn't say a single word as democracy in Canada ended. That's pretty weird, if you think about it. Canada is not some exotic, faraway land with an alien culture and unintelligible language. It's not . Canada is our neighbor. It's our trading partner. Canada is our closest ally on Earth. It's frankly part of our country. Our vice president grew up in Canada, so did half of our comedians and actors and singers. Our border with Canada is the longest border in the world. It stretches more than 5,500 miles. So on every level, we are deeply intertwined with Canada, whether we notice it or not. What happens there matters here. If nothing else, it's a preview of what will likely happen in the . So with that in mind, you should know that Justin Trudeau is no longer the prime minister of Canada. Justin Trudeau is Canada's maximum leader, its strongman, its potentate. Justin Trudeau is the dictator of Canada. If you think that's an overstatement, try to think of another way to describe what Justin Trudeau is now doing. For the first time in Canada's history, Trudeau has invoked what's known as the Emergencies Act, but the protests he is facing hardly qualify as an emergency. But suddenly, Justin Trudeau has the power to crush all political opposition to his rule, and that's exactly what he's doing. Trudeau has ended  in Canada. He's banned free assembly. Trudeau's government has shut down political rallies and arrested his political critics without probable cause. Trudeau has instituted internal passports, that restrict travel within Canada, to the politically obedient. Canadians are no longer allowed to leave their own country unless they obey Justin Trudeau. And if they don't obey, they could be bankrupted and destroyed. He now has the power to do that. Trudeau has claimed the power to freeze the financial assets of any Canadian who resists him. No court order is required to do this, he just decides.  Justin Trudeau can even dictate what you do for a living and how you do it. Today, Trudeau threatened to arrest tow truck drivers who refused to tow the trucks of protesters. Is this really about stopping the spread of ? No one in Canada is even pretending that it is anymore. Trudeau himself didn't mention the risk of COVID a single time yesterday. He's not worried about unvaccinated truckers spreading a virus. Trudeau is worried about Canadians resisting his rule. And that's why Trudeau's government announced yesterday they plan to regulate cryptocurrency forever. Watch. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Oh, the Terrorist Financing Act. So that was a law passed to defeat Al Qaeda. Now it's being used to stop law-abiding Canadians, middle-class people, students, truck drivers, from protecting their earnings from the total mismanagement of Canada's Central Bank. Justin Trudeau has wrecked the Canadian ; but thanks to the Terrorist Financing Act, there is no escape from the consequences. Canadians are going to have to live with the consequences of Justin Trudeau's fiscal recklessness, whether they want to or not. Otherwise, they're terrorists. It shouldn't surprise you that Trudeau's first move in the face of a trucker protest was to clamp down on cryptocurrency.  will try this in this country, guaranteed. They'll tell us Bitcoin is a Russian plot, CNN will dutifully back them up. Watch it happen. But at the same time, you've got to wonder, since we're speaking of terrorism, what happened to the actual terrorists? Those do exist. How is Justin Trudeau treating them? Well, let's see. A few years ago, Justin Trudeau gave more than $10 million in taxpayer money in a settlement to a self-described Al Qaeda soldier called Omar Khadr. Khadr murdered a U.S.  sergeant. Now murdering a U.S. Army sergeant is bad, but it's not as bad as criticizing Justin Trudeau. So Trudeau did not freeze Khadr's bank account. Instead, he just made him rich and moved on. When anti-Christian arsonists burned more than 50 Catholic churches across Canada, Justin Trudeau did not declare an emergency. Instead, he issued a statement sympathizing with them, ""It is fully understandable,"" Trudeau said, ""Given the shameful history we all becoming more aware of.""Are you beginning to see how this works? In a dictatorship, the only real  is opposing the regime. So how did all this happen so quickly in a country as nice and moderate as Canada? Well it happened the way that it always happened. It happened with maximum aggression and limited popular support. Justin Trudeau won reelection last year with less than a third of the national vote. In fact, he finished the election behind his main competitor, the Conservative Party. Thanks to quirks in the parliamentary system, Trudeau took power anyway, and he immediately began to crack down on anyone who opposed him. Trudeau had relatively few supporters, but they turned out to be the right supporters. They were the people with power.  The woman, for example, you just saw announcing the crackdown on cryptocurrency is Canada's deputy prime minister. But before she was that, she was a long-time journalist, including in our country. She used to write for The Washington Post. She's currently married to a New York Times reporter. Why is that relevant? Well, because up and down this story, you see the starring role that media organizations have played in the death of Canadian democracy. The other day, for example, somebody hacked the  of the crowdfunding website Give Fund Go, and then revealed the names of people who donated to the truckers protesting in Ottawa. You've got to ask yourself who would have the tech savvy and the political motive to do something like that? Well, state intelligence agencies would. In fact, we can't really think of anybody else. It would certainly be interesting to find out who did it. It's a big part of the story. But media companies seem curiously uninterested in finding out who did it. Instead, they immediately started using this stolen information to intimidate the donors. Anyone who dared to send money to Justin Trudeau's political opponents was unmasked in public, shamed, and of course, inevitably threatened. Because that's what happens. Trudeau's state TV channel, the CBC, has been working on this retribution project all day long. They knew who their enemies are, and they knew who their master is. It's Justin Trudeau. But Canada's National Post newspaper is doing the same thing. The National Post is supposedly independent of the government, but they're still doing it. In this country, Vice Media, to its great and eternal shame, has been doing the same thing. So what do all of these media companies have in common? Well, they're all squarely on the side of entrenched power against the population they supposedly serve. That's the opposite of what journalism was designed to do. But at this point, it is the rule. Not just in the United States, but around the world. Reporters and politicians and big  all align against voters, against you. Have you noticed? Earlier this week, the CBC warned Canadians that the word freedom has ""become common among far-right groups."" So only QAnon wants freedom. Remember that the next time you complain about Justin Trudeau. Media organizations have been agitating against democracy for years now, even as they've posed loudly as its greatest defenders. In February of 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, Vice Media ran this headline: ""Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government will 'enforce' a vaccine for coronavirus."" ""Anti-vax groups on social media are claiming that the spread of the disease will lead to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance."" Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. Now that all of that has actually happened, Vice has not apologized, instead Vice is helping Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about him. In October of that same year, 2020, the CBC warned Canadians about a ""disinformation campaign [that] falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent to quarantine sites."" A few months later, as if on cue, the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians to quarantine sites. But the CBC never apologized for posting what turned out to be disinformation. Instead, they set about enforcing Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. They see that as their job. So by the way, this is the so-called academic community. These are the university professors who've been granted lifetime job security, precisely so they can think for themselves. Freely, independent from government control. And yet, in practice, no one is more controlled by the government than they are. Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University — that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau — telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. Watch. PROFESSOR:  Oh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. But isn't holding anti-government views allowed in a democracy? In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government the degree to which you're allowed to question the people in charge? Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. Yes, it is indeed a scary problem when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau — arrest them. On MSNBC, which is less subtle, but a lot more straightforward most of the time, they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures; the problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. Time to get the stick and start hurting people. JOE SCARBOROUGH: Settle down, tough guy. There's going to be someone there with a stick. It's interesting. It's always the very same people who call for violence. It's almost like it excites them. It's not a good sign. So clearly there is an appetite for Canadian-style tyranny in this country, and the question is how long til we get it? Let's see. This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies are trying to censor a  website called ZeroHedge. Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community told The Associated Press, off-the-record of course, that ZeroHedge was, ""spreading Russian propaganda,"" by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. We can't have that. So how long before they pull ZeroHedge off the internet? How long before they try the same thing with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media? All of whom, we can tell you firsthand, have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin.  And when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, what will we call it then? CNN will, of course, describe it as a necessary national security measure. But it's not that. It's tyranny. And by the way, since when does the  get to decide what websites Americans read? Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? Old-fashioned liberals, anyone? What do they think of this? Maybe they don't notice it. In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. They don't look very threatening. They're not the  version of fascist. Look at Justin Trudeau. He's absurd. The '70s haircut, all those little outfits when he feels like playing dress-up. He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous. But maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. Instead, they promote color revolutions and control foreign governments from afar. That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, which became a far more repressive place once Joe Biden began running it, and he does run Ukraine. Make no mistake. That's what they do. This new class of dictators seizes power incrementally, through the bureaucracy. They never raise their voices. They don't wave their arms. They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy and public health. They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity. They're entirely passive-aggressive. But they're no less dangerous. One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job and seized your bank account for the crime of disagreeing with them. This is the architecture of tyranny, and it's not just happening in Canada. It's happening here in the United States. It will be used against us. Bet on it. "	argues Canadian prime minister combating trucker protests tyranny item noticed canceled democracy last night remarkable seemed notice outcry political class friend declared martial law

753	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-donald-trump-durham-probe	2022-02-14 22:46:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: Donald Trump was right, Democrats were spying on him | Fox News	" Fox News host gives his take on the Durham probe on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'If you watch  closely over his four years in office, and we did, it became pretty clear that the more outlandish the claim that Trump happened to be making, the more likely it was to be true.  Trump did tend to exaggerate at times, but it's mostly about topics that didn't matter. How big was the crowd at his 2016 inauguration? Who cares? But on the big things, on matters of civilizational importance, Trump told the truth bluntly, often when nobody else would.  The Iraq War was a mistake, Trump said. Illegal immigration is a disaster. China is taking over the world. Haiti is a pretty crappy place. Deafening hysteria followed every one of these demonstrably true statements. At one point in early 2018, CNN and the Washington Post got so worked up trying to hide the obvious that they devoted blanket coverage to the claim that actually, Haiti is an awesome and fully functional country, a perfect spot for your next family vacation and, by the way, if you disagree with that, you're racist. That's what they told us.    Three years later, they have dropped the POWs, at least on Haiti. Our leaders now consider Haiti so awful that just being from there qualifies you for asylum in the United States. With Trump gone, they can finally admit that. What was once a dangerous conspiracy theory is now just a sensible observation, especially when it justifies more immigration.  For four years, no dangerous conspiracy theory was considered more dangerous or more conspiratorial than the claim that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had spied on Donald Trump. The very idea that Hillary Clinton, of all people, had spied on anyone was preposterous. The media informed us only a lunatic would claim otherwise.  By making a charge like that, in fact, Trump was emboldening our enemies and degrading the public's confidence in our democratic system. So, it wasn't just a stupid opinion that Trump had, it was really a form of treason and yet, as usual, Trump kept saying it.  He did it again in one of his last sit-down interviews as president with Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes."" ""No, as a matter of fact, we can’t verify that."" This is CBS News. We don't air things we can't verify. Really, Lesley Stahl? Is that true? We still remember a CBS News piece from 2016 that claimed  Donald Trump was secretly working with Vladimir Putin. So, the question is, how did CBS News verify those facts? Walk us through your reporting process.    Well, as it turns out, that particular story, the reporting came from reading a piece on Slate.com, probably while standing in line at Starbucks. Slate alleged that the Trump campaign was coordinating with a Russian bank called Alfa Bank, using a hidden server in Trump Tower.  How did Slate.com know this? By consulting a ""small, tightly-knit community of computer scientists."" These scientists, Slate insisted, we're totally nonpartisan. One of the sources explained, anonymously, ""We wanted to defend both campaigns because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election.""  So here you have just another unnamed computer scientist defending election integrity. Makes sense. Don't ask questions.  Jake Sullivan did not ask questions. Jake Sullivan takes Slate.com very seriously. At the time, Jake Sullivan was working for the Hillary Clinton campaign. He cited the Slate story as evidence that Trump was indeed colluding with Vladimir Putin.""The secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump's ties to Russia,"" Sullivan said.  What a tool.  ""We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia."" So, there was a bat phone in Trump Tower that rang directly in the Kremlin. Jake Sullivan stuck to that line for months. Here he is on CNN in March of 2017. Oh, the secret hotline. These people are literally willing to say anything if it gives them power, but listen carefully to what Jake Sullivan said. ""I don't have a line into the FBI on this."" Everything I know is from ""public reporting."" So you'll notice that Sullivan went out of his way to say that, what should have been a very clear sign that it was a lie and indeed it was a lie. In fact, the Hillary Clinton for President campaign was coordinating directly with the FBI.  A Clinton lawyer called Michael Sussmann had been feeding false claims about Trump and Russia, once again from that crack team of nonpartisan computer scientists to the General Counsel at the FBI, a man called James Baker.   But Sussmann didn't stop there. In February of 2017, after the election, Sussmann also met with the General Counsel at CIA. So at this point, you may be wondering about the identity of those nonpartisan computer scientists who dug up all this new information about Donald Trump's direct connection to Vladimir Putin.  Who are these people? We may not be shocked to learn they weren't nonpartisan. Once again, Jake Sullivan was lying to us. In fact, a pro-Hillary Clinton activist from South Africa called Rodney Joffe had put together a team of digital researchers. Oppo guys, we used to call them. Msost of them came from Georgia Tech.  In emails, Rodney Joffe explained why he was doing this. He wanted Hillary to win the presidency because Hillary Clinton had promised him a job as a top cybersecurity officer in the U.S. Government. So Joffe wanted to help Hillary win, he said that.  In order to do that, he gave his nonpartisan computer scientists a mission. Their job was to gather data they had access to, thanks to a Pentagon contract, in order to connect Donald Trump to Putin. Now we know all this thanks to a new court filing from Special Counsel John Durham, who spent the last few years investigating the origins of the Russia hoax and is finally producing some material.  In the words of Durham's filing ""Joffe tasked those researchers to mine internet data to establish 'an inference' and a 'narrative' tying then-candidate Trump to Russia."" So, this wasn't reporting, of course, they had a goal. They were trying to get Hillary elected president. The amazing thing is how they did it, where their data came from.  The filing says that Joffe and his computer scientists intercepted internet traffic, that is emails and presumably text messages, from ""Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building and the Executive Office of the President of the United States."" In other words, Trump was right. This isn't a conspiracy theory. His claims were true. Democrats were spying on Donald Trump, not just as a candidate, but as president of the United States in the White House, as well as in his own home. So, has anything like this ever happened in American history? Not that we know of, but Jeff Bezos doesn't think you should worry about it or even know that it happened. Today's Washington Post informed it's brain-dead readership that while, ""Trump is once again claiming that he was spied upon."" That claim has been ""debunked."" Oh, really? How has it been debunked?  Shut up. It just has. But in fact, that claim has not been debunked. It has been verified. That claim is true. It actually happened and the way it happened tells you everything about why it has been so extraordinarily difficult to bring democracy back to the United States. A government contractor spied on a populist presidential candidate, then passed the information to his opponent's campaign, which gave it to the FBI and the news media, which distorted it to create the illusion of treason, which was then cited by the politician who paid for the whole thing as a reason not to vote for the guy she spied on.  Got it? It's a closed-loop. Everyone's got a role. Here's Hillary Clinton during the presidential debates:   So, if you're not all in with NATO, if you think it's a pointless boondoggle that endangers the United States, you, my friend, work for Vladimir Putin.  ""You encouraged espionage,"" shrieked Hillary. At the very moment, she's doing precisely that. They always denounce you for their own sins, but she said Russia has engaged in cyberattacks on the United States and that's probably true in point of fact. But she was speaking about a specific ""cyberattack."" She was talking about the Russians hacking the servers at the DNC. Democrats wasted three years of our lives telling us that, at an ever-increasing volume. Here's the interesting thing. It was not true. It has never been true. Vladimir Putin did not hack the DNC. There was never any evidence that the Russians hacked the DNC. Instead, the DNC emails were very clearly stolen from within the building, most likely by a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to show the world how Bernie Sanders was being shafted by the very same corrupt forces in Washington that later shifted Donald Trump. That was very obvious to anyone who's paying attention at the time.   What's interesting is that no one's been punished for it. Likely, no one ever will be. In fact, Jake Sullivan, the guy you just saw lying about those nonpartisan computer scientists, has not been indicted for what he did. Jake Sullivan has been promoted. Jake Sullivan is now Joe Biden's national security adviser. He's still screaming about Russia. Only this time it's not to bring down a Republican opponent in the presidential race. He's screaming about Russia to bring the entire country to war with a nuclear-armed power. "	gives take Durham probe watch closely four office became pretty clear outlandish claim Trump making likely

756	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-canada-panicking-tyranny	2022-02-11 22:58:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: Canada's leaders are panicking because their citizens are tired of tyranny | Fox News	"nWe’ve been covering this truck strike in  all week and at the end of the week there were a couple of different images that kind of floated around your head. Picture the cops stealing the fuel from the freezing truckers. Picture the smiling trucker talking about love and waving the Canadian flag. Totally non-threatening. But above all, you remember the hysteria of the people in charge as they look out on the sea of working-class people who are sick of being pushed around. The people in charge are extremely upset about this. Hysterical. It’s hilarious. You can just picture a transportation secretary, little  jumping up and down, shaking his little hands, screaming at the truck drivers, get off my bridge, you guys, get off my bridge right now!It’s not just Mayor Pete, you remember those angry tweets from the CNN contributor who suggested we should slash their tires, siphon their diesel fuel, throw them in prison. They're all Torquemada now. They are talking like they are scary. But keep in mind, these are not displays of power. This is not how confident people talk. These are squeaks of impotence. Our leaders are furious at the truckers because they know that there’s not a lot they can do about the truckers. They don’t know anything about trucks, for one thing. How do you get a truck off a bridge, especially when it has no fuel or tires? They have no idea You just order someone to do it. It’s kind of like an Uber eats. Some guy trots out and removes the truck. The problem is, the people who drive the trucks don’t feel like following orders anymore. They are ignoring Pete Buttigieg. If you actually want to move a big rig, you need tow truck operators. And those tow truck operators know truckers. They know truckers are not a racist. They are not Nazi's no matter how many times Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau claim they are. So some of them aren’t inclined to help. David Allen, for example, is the president of Gary's Towing in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He told Canadian media ""we have all the capabilities on our tow trucks to do it, but I don’t think anyone would want to."" Another tow truck operator said even if tow truck operators wanted to help, carry out Pete Buttigieg's orders it would be very hard, ""In the end, the truckers get a say on whether you are taking that truck away or not."" There are technical reasons for this, it turns out trucks are heavy. They have air brakes and steel-belted tires. Some truckers removed their tires completely. So what now? Now is when you start to panic. And they definitely are. This afternoon the Prime Minister of Canada clearly who is Fidel Castro’s illegitimate son, came out from hiding to threaten the protesters directly. You could be breaking laws! That’s the funniest part. These people don’t care about the law at all. They believe they make the law. This is the prime minister who ordered the cops to steal people’s fuel. There is no law that says you can’t have fuel in Ottawa. He just made that up. Now he’s lecturing about the law. Joe Biden who was violating federal law on the grand scale every day by importing two million people illegally without your consent, he’s upset about the law. Justin Trudeau is so upset he is threatening the truckers' children. ""It’s time to go home especially if you have your kids with you,"" Trudeau said. Wouldn't want something to happen to them. Trudeau also attacked the protesters for closing the border. Only Justin Trudeau is allowed to do that. Which he has done for more than a year. So what are we watching here? It’s more than hypocrisy. What we are watching is panic. Justin Trudeau knows that nobody joined the protest because they are ""tired of COVID."" They are tired of tyranny. They are tired of being told to inject something into their bodies they don’t want, whose long-term effects cannot be known. Sold by companies that are protected, that have immunity from public recourse. We also know that what they told us to do didn’t work. The lockdowns didn’t work. Johns Hopkins came out and said it the other day. Pretty conclusively. That is what people are mad about. They want their freedom back. They are not tired of the virus, they are tired of the leaders who have used the virus to give themselves more power. And they're still doing it. Here is Ontario's premier Doug Ford. He announced today that instead of lifting his useless mandates, he’s going to steal the truckers money, fine them, and send them to jail. -When you start making threats like that, you’ve already lost. What you are showing is that you are impotent and that is why you are unreasonable. That is why you are hysterical. When you start stealing things from people, outside of the law, speaking of the law, everybody knows you are weak. Keep in mind that truckers raise $10 million on GoFundMe, that's a California company, but Canadian politicians had that effort shut down. Then GiveSendGo, a Delaware company, raised almost the same amount and Canadian politicians went after that money too. The attorney general of Ontario successfully got a court order to freeze access to the 8.4 million raised on GiveSendGo. Those funds were going to an adopted trucker fundraising campaign who is paying for ""housing, water, food, accommodations, and shuttle services"" for truck drivers in Ottowa. But all that money has just been stolen by the Canadian government. It has been seized. All of this is pushing people away from governmentissued currencies because they're controlled by lunatics like Ford. They are moving towards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Just like 18 wheelers on bridges, blockchain is pretty tough for authorities to control. Therefore, this is how you know it’s a threat: The crypto guys must be White supremacists. That is exactly what they are not telling us.""It’s problematic at best."" How do people like that get on television? There should be an IQ requirement. By putting dumb people in the anchor chair, they are perfectly compliant to the people in charge. ""Crypto is White supremacy."" But the hysteria gives them away. As a trucker explained, these people are terrified, they are scared of losing control. The blockade at the Windsor Bridge panicked them.  The downside of all of this is it's turning Canada into a legitimate police state, for real. One of Doug Ford's police officers harassed a woman at her home because of something she wrote on Facebook in support of the truckers. In 2022, the Stasi are chirpy. We are here is a proactive measure to inform you of your rights, not because we are spying on your social media. So to recap, donating to the truckers is criminal. Saying anything positive about the truckers gets the police to show up at your house. That is why truckers are the new QAnon, Russia, White supremacist, extremist threat. Our leaders agree. In Michigan dopey old Gretchen Whitmer is planning to attack them with bulldozers.Working closely with our federal partners. Keep in mind, they’re not talking about ISIS, these are truck drivers, the people who bring you food. They are unarmed and waving Canadian flags talking about love. A lot of them brought their kids. Should CNN's national security contributors and the neoliberal politicians who are attacking them really weigh into this? No. Because they can’t win it. One side is too sympathetic. The other is too loathsome. But they can’t help themselves. They are so threatened by disobedience that they rush forward with swords drawn. They know if Canadian truckers can get away with it the game is over. So they must crush anyone who questions the high priest of neoliberalism. That category includes plenty of people on the right, obviously, but tellingly it includes plenty of people who aren’t on the right, but just feel like thinking for themselves.  It includes anyone who invests in bitcoin. It includes Sikh truck drivers in Ottawa who now work for Putin. And Joe Rogan, who's now a racist, and David Portnoy, who's now a sex offender, and Tavis Smiley, who's now a serial harasser. Those aren't right-wingers, those are just people who dare to say what they think. That slander hasn’t worked. And it won’t work here. You can’t cancel a bridge full of 18-wheelers and shame them into driving away. They are going to try it tomorrow. There’s going to be a showdown in Windsor, Ontario. We'll see what happens. But the rest of the world has already learned the lesson. Which is, if you resist, if you say you’ve had enough, peacefully, cheerfully, with love, they have to pay attention. It’s the only thing they pay attention to. "	nWe covering truck strike week end week couple different images floated around head Picture cops stealing fuel freezing truckers Picture smiling trucker love waving Canadian flag

759	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-canada-working-class-rebelled	2022-02-10 23:37:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: Canada's working class has finally rebelled, and they are succeeding | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the Freedom Convoy protests on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'When  politicians across this country all of a sudden start to pull back their mask mandates, they did it virtually overnight and of course they did it in unison, we naturally assumed that new polling had to be behind it. Someone at the DNC must have seen terrifying public opinion numbers and decided to abandon ""Project Quarantine"" before the midterm elections. That made sense to us. We explain that theory on the show last night. We still think it's probably pretty true, but it's also clear as of tonight that there was another explanation for this. Democrats in this country are looking north to their friends in the ruling party of Canada and what they see there scares them.   working class has finally rebelled after years of relentless abuse. Truck drivers are threatening to topple Justin Trudeau's creepy little government with their big rigs, and they may succeed, actually. The protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates have been far more effective than anyone in charge imagined.  For Democrats in the United States, that's a pretty obvious lesson. Over the past 48 hours, Canadian truckers have blocked the major trade routes between their country and ours. Last night, farmers driving heavy agricultural equipment shut down the highways at the Manitoba border with the United States. Eleven hundred miles away, a similar scene on the border of Ontario in the United States. Green tractors with Canadian flags lining the highway in protest, but the most meaningful blockade of all is taking place right now on the Ambassador Bridge. That's the privately-owned span that connects Detroit to Windsor, Ontario.If you live in the Upper Midwest, you know it well. A quarter of all the trade between the United States and Canada, one another's biggest trading partners, that's billions of dollars, comes across that bridge and as Fox's Molly Line is reporting from Ottawa, that bridge is now completely shut down.      ""We want freedom,"" the truckers are saying,"" freedom from mandates."" It's a very straightforward ask, but so far the truckers don't have that freedom and so their blockade continues.  So far, that blockade has forced the Ford Motor Company to shut down one of its manufacturing plants and to operate another plant with a skeleton crew.  Toyota says it won't be able to manufacture vehicles in Ontario for the rest of the week. General Motors has canceled multiple shifts at its plant in Lansing, Michigan, due to part shortages. So this protest is less than a week old, and already it is causing deep pain to at least one global industry.  It's hard to overstate the historical significance of what we're watching right here. The Canadian trucker convoy is the single most successful human rights protest in a generation. If nothing else, it has been a very useful reminder to our entitled ruling class. The working-class men can be pushed, but only so far. When they push back, it hurts.  It turns out that truck drivers are more important to a country's future than, say, diversity consultants or even MSNBC contributors. Who knew? The White House has no interest in knowing. According to the Associated Press, tonight, the Biden administration is, ""urging the Trudeau government"" to ""use its federal powers to stop this protest"" to end the truckers' protest. In other words, crush them by force. Politico was reporting that Biden officials are coordinating with Canadian authorities to, ""establish alternate traffic routes around the protesters."" That Scranton Joe, the pro-union guy shutting down a labor action. Pete Buttigieg is the completely incompetent transportation secretary in this country. Apparently, he's in charge of this effort. What Mayor Pete does not realize is it's not so easy.   Truck drivers know a lot more about roads than McKinsey consultants do. An alternative border crossing in Alberta, for example, has already been totally shut down. They thought of that already, Mayor Pete. The Blue Water Bridge, which connects Ontario to Port Huron, Michigan, has been reporting delays tonight of nearly five hours. Now there is an obvious way to fix this problem. Manuel Moroun, who is the owner of the Ambassador Bridge into Michigan, just spelled it out for Justin Trudeau, who is not terribly bright. End the vaccine mandates and the bridge reopens. It's not hard, but Justin Trudeau won't, and he's decided he doesn't have to because the truckers, as he's explained, have no legitimate complaint. They're racists, so we're not required to listen to them.  Here was Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament on Monday:   Oh, so they're not even really Canadians? They're Nazis. So you don't have to hear anything they say. They don't even belong here. Maybe we'll intern them or expel them. Trudeau state broadcasters have been repeating these lies over and over and over again for maximum effect. Pravda parroting Brezhnev. That's what they do. What's striking, however, is that the media in our country claim to be independent, but they've been doing the very same thing.          There are QAnon supporters in the crowd. It's a cult. They're Nazis and they're crazy! Insurrectionists on the Edmund Pettus Bridge!"" Imagine.  Now they're using these smears because typically they work. Just dismiss these people. Don't listen to them. They didn't go to college, but what Justin Trudeau apparently didn't count on is that a handful of independent journalists are committing journalism inside Canada and a free press works. That's why we have it - or did.    So, instead of repeating state-mandated talking points, like their journalists do in the morons and our press corps do, these independent reporters have been broadcasting hours-long interviews with the truckers themselves in their cabs, totally unfiltered so you can decide what you think. You can actually make your own judgment about reality.  So you watch these streams for just a few minutes, and you realize that these truckers, whatever their faults may be, are far less odious and much harder-working than the journalists and the politicians who call them Nazis.  Here's one 24-year-old protester who saved up and bought his own truck. He's an owner-operator now. He's losing hundreds of dollars every day because he's no longer working, but he says it's worth it because he's more concerned about human rights than about his own paycheck. You decide. Yeah, the voice of the working man there. Now, we know he's a Nazi? Because he used the word ""freedom."" Now that footage, of course, was not shot by the CBC, which is Canadian state media, the most dishonest of all. It was from a livestream on the YouTube channel Zot. It was filmed just after midnight this morning.  Zot is run by a man you've never heard of called Matt Garcia. Garcia is one of a handful of independent YouTube channel operators who are doing what legacy media refuses to do anywhere, ever, anymore. Garcia actually talks to people. He reports. He's not paid to do this. He's doing it because nobody else will do it. You should watch it. It's compelling because you can hear people speak and you can decide what you think about what they have to say.  Here's another protester that Garcia spoke to in the streets of Ottawa. This man says that Justin Trudeau's authoritarian behavior reminds him of the ayatollahs in the country he left, which is Iran. So what's the answer to him? Is he in QAnon? Is he a Nazi? Is he a White supremacist? Canada's leaders have no response whatsoever. They just accuse all these people of bigotry and then they turn away.  The protesters are so immoral we have no obligation to listen to them because democracy. We all lose when they do that because actually, the truckers do have something to say, and some of them are pretty articulate. Some of them are even eloquent about what they want. So, as a public service, we thought you might like to read it. No, that's not extreme. If you want to see extremism, take a close look at how Canada's ruling class is responding to these decidedly non-extreme protests. Authorities in Canada are now stealing firewood from protesters in subzero temperatures.  We're not making it up. Now, that one is not being used in a crime. They're not using it to rob liquor stores. The protesters are using the wood to keep from freezing to death in February, but Trudeau's enforcers just took it from them. They also seized fuel, which the truckers are using to keep from dying in their cabs overnight. Watch.   So, let's say you were on American television or you worked at the Brookings Institution or the Atlantic Council or you were Liz Cheney or any one of the many people who lecture you every day about democracy. What would you make of that exchange? Now you might not like the guy's beard, or you may not like who we voted for, but what's your answer to him?  If police are breaking the law by enforcing an order from the guy who runs the country, is that a democracy? No, it's not. It's not a free country. It's a very scary place and that's exactly what Canada has become under Justin Trudeau.  We'll show just one more example. There are a lot of these, but we're not going to drag it out. You see the point. Watch this one. These are police acting under Justin Trudeau's orders, dragging an elderly man to jail and hurting him along the way. Why? Because he dared to honk his horn in support of the truckers.   They hurt him too. Look up his bruises on the internet. So in the end, Canadians are nice people. The cliche is true and they're seeing some of this. It's being hidden from them on their state media, but it's all on the internet.  So, Justin Trudeau is attacking human rights and attacking humans, and that ultimately is bound to provoke a backlash, and it is. The province of Alberta just announced it is lifting its COVID restrictions and scrapping its vaccine passport system completely. Saskatchewan, Quebec, Prince Edward Island have done the same. They're getting rid of most of their COVID restrictions in the face of this, in response to this. When you go too far as Ceausescu learned, people turn against you.  It was just a few days ago that a guy called Jagmeet Singh, he's the leader of Canada's supposedly pro-worker NDP party, smeared the truckers as racists, of course, ""those that claim the superiority of the White bloodline."" What a pig. It's always the same lie, but yesterday, even Jagmeet Singh finally realized the same old slander doesn't work anymore. So he went to Plan B. He went for a federal plan to ""exit the pandemic.""  In other words, he caved in the face of principled human rights protests. That's how that works. Several members of Justin Trudeau's own Liberal Party are now rebuking Justin Trudeau. One of those lawmakers, a member of parliament called Joel Lightbound, described Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates as ""an attempt to wedge to divide and to stigmatize. I fear that this politicization of the pandemic risks undermining the public's trust in our public health institutions.""  Ya think? Yeah, we in America know a little bit about that. Who will trust a doctor when the smoke settles from coronavirus? Seriously. But on a political level, anyone watching this understands just how profound the betrayal is, the betrayal both in Canada and in the United States. Self-described liberals, the ones who've lectured you for decades about the nobility of organized labor are now taking the side of management, of strikebreakers over striking workers. They're applauding, like Mr. Burns on The Simpsons as cops harass and abuse strikers and their families.  Pretty soon, they'll be demanding scabs, literally, if they aren't already. It's so deeply revealing. Scratch a liberal and you'll find a fascist. Today on Twitter, an Obama DHS official called Juliette Kayyem called for violence against the truckers. ""Slash their tires,"" she demanded, but don't stop there. ""Cancel their insurance, suspend their driver's licenses, prohibit any future regulatory certification for truckers, etc. Have we learned nothing? Fellow members of the ruling class? These things fester when there are no consequences."" Crush them before they get big ideas.  Now, Juliette Kayyem is a nasty little fascist, and of course, she is a CNN contributor, too. Of course she is, but we will concede Juliette Kayyem is right about one thing. These things do fester when you ignore the population's legitimate concerns for long enough.   When you dismiss, your own citizens as racists and conspiracy nuts and try and shut them down for long enough, at some point, they are apt to revolt. Once people realize they're citizens, not serfs, you can't really know where things go from there.  And in that vein, tonight, a group of American truckers announced they will begin a nationwide truck convoy in this country starting next month in protest against Joe Biden's vaccine mandates. That rally will begin in southern California on March 5th, and then it will progress eastward, by truck, to Washington, D.C., a city they still perhaps naively assume is the capital of their country.   How does the supposedly pro-union White House feel about this? They're completely panicked. Working-class people expressing their opinions? That's not allowed.  So Joe Biden, taking a page from Justin Trudeau, his friend to the North, has already set the Department of Homeland Security to work to shut them down. We'll be covering that in some detail. There is some drama ahead.  "	gives take Freedom Convoy protests politicians across sudden start pull back mask mandates virtually overnight unison naturally assumed polling behind Someone DNC must

762	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-restore-democracy-mass-hysteria	2022-02-09 23:37:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: Restoring democracy is the only way to avoid future mass hysteria | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host slams Democratic politicians for creating ‘mass hysteria’ through the pandemic.It'd be pretty fascinating to see the latest internal polling on  restrictions. We haven't seen it, but it must have been pretty awful, apocalyptic, because something spooked them bad. Over the course of less than a week, the same people who have systematically turned America into a quarantine camp suddenly, out of nowhere, started calling in unison for medical freedom. Suddenly, they sounded like Bobby Kennedy Jr., pretty much all of them. Even the whiny hypochondriacs at The Atlantic Magazine, those neurotic cat owners who've turned COVID hysteria into a  are now calling for a total abandonment of all Coronavirus restrictions. ""Open everything. … The time to when pandemic restrictions is now."" Believe it or not, that was the headline on The Atlantic's website today. Amazing. So if even The Atlantic has given up on coronavirus restrictions, obviously the pandemic is over. You should know this virus was killed, not by science, but by the . It turns out the only real cure for COVID-19 is the political ambition of the Democratic Party. That's the panacea. And by the way, that's fine. We'll take it. Yes, every upside has a downside. It means that pasty NPR listeners are going to emerge from their apartment for the first time in two years will be loose on the streets. You're going to see them at Whole Foods again, shuffling along with their tote bags, looking bewildered and annoyed. That's bad, but it's still worth it. Anything to make the insanity go away, we're celebrating. But we're also looking forward. And the question is, how do we guarantee that nothing like this ever happens again? How do we prevent future mass hysteria events in the ? And the answer is very simple. You restore democracy. You give Americans a voice in the policies that affect their lives. That was the system that we had for a couple of hundred years, it was a pretty good system. We ought to go back to it.  If elected  were allowed to vote on COVID restrictions, we'd have far fewer COVID restrictions. And that's true of everything, every bad idea. If the  had to follow the Constitution and authorize our wars, we'd have fewer pointless wars. We definitely would not be moving toward war with  right now because the public doesn't support that, at all. So virtually every bad thing that has happened over the past two years, or ever, has been imposed by fiat, far outside the bounds of our constitutional democracy. In this case, governors and health authorities got emergency powers at the beginning of the pandemic. Do you remember? With those powers, they played God for two full years. In case you've forgotten what that was like, here it is: So they went full fascist immediately, and they weren't even competent fascists. These are some of the least impressive, least skilled, least accomplished, least intelligent people in our entire country. You wouldn't hire any of them to clean your gutters, and all of a sudden they had absolute power. So it's probably not too surprising that they went into directions no one could have anticipated. No singing under COVID, no dancing, no working, definitely no exercising. We're closing the gyms, in the name of public health. In fact, we're closing the oceans. In 2020, in a moment that should never be forgotten by the sane world, authorities in the state of California arrested a paddleboarder who was exercising by himself off the Malibu pier. NBC 2020:  So everything about that is kind of stunning, less than two years later, even. But maybe the creepiest part of it is how nonchalantly the NBC newsman reported it like it's totally normal to drag paddleboarders away for swimming alone. Because if cops didn't vigorously police the Pacific Ocean, seagulls could spread disease. Apparently, that was the thinking or the lack of it. So our , almost to a person, acted like the peasants they are, and they cheered on the strongman reflexively, because that's what peasants do. They cheer as the person oppressing them rides by on this horse. MSNBC excitedly reported on how police in New Jersey, this is very clever, used drones to spy on homeowners in their own backyards.MSNBC: DRONE: MSNBC: So some robot is screaming at you as you're having a barbecue in your backyard, and MSNBC describes that as the ""lifesaving message."" Don't depend on these people to save you from tyranny. Of course, they'll be cheering it on. That very same month that MSNBC aired that unbelievable report, we decided to speak to the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy. Now, Phil Murphy is a not very bright finance hack who got rich. How do these people get rich, exactly? But in his case, thanks to the Wuhan Institute of Technology, suddenly  found himself king of the Garden State. So we asked his majesty Phil Murphy, where exactly did he get the right to suspend constitutional rights in New Jersey? And here's what he said. TUCKER 2020:  MURPHY: ""That's above my pay grade."" So King Murphy's got an IQ of about 70. How did that guy get to be governor? I mean, that's bad enough, but to give him absolute power? Let's go ahead and never do that again, under any circumstance. Checks and balances exist for a reason. We saw this all over the country.  and local officials abusing their authority, very specifically, to stop Christians from attending church, to prevent people from worshiping their God, from exercising their . And somehow, nobody noticed. But voters noticed. Last fall, Phil Murphy almost lost his job in New Jersey, which is axiomatically democratic, it's the most democratic state you can think of on the eastern seaboard. So Murphy seemed a little confused by this. ""My subjects don't like me, really? I had no idea."" So he convened a focus group. Let's hire McKinsey to find out what's going on here. Well, according to New York Times, here's what his majesty Phil Murphy found, ""Across the board, voters shared frustrations over public health measures, a sense of pessimism about the future and a deep desire to return to some sense of normalcy."" And by normalcy, of course, they meant getting Phil Murphy's boot off their necks. So Murphy, as we said, seemed a little stunned by this. But he reacted. Because in the end, these people are very simple organisms. Politicians are. They're not complex, they're not ideological. They respond to what they have to do. To blunt stimuli. So he recognizes the midterm elections are coming. So Phil Murphy, again, not a genius, lifted the state's mask mandates. And that's happening in a lot of different places, blue states. Governors in Connecticut, Oregon, Delaware, California, Illinois. They're all doing it. Even in , where the ""Governor"" Kathy Hochul, - that's what we call an unelected leader whom not a single voter actually voted for - she reached the same conclusion. Kathy Hochul, the ""governor"" (you know, by the way, in a lot of places, you can be arrested for impersonating a public official, she's not the governor, she was never elected by anybody, and no one's arrested her) apparently has the power to lift the state's indoor mask mandate. So she's doing that. But she shouldn't imagine this is over. They still have power. They don't want to give it up. So the Health Department in New York is trying to expand the state's quarantine powers, just in case they ever have to put you in a camp. Kathy Hochul has decided not to lift the mask mandate for schools because, of course, the teachers' unions have more swap than parents do. Meanwhile, the CDC still requires U.S. citizens to get a negative COVID test in order to return to their own country. So the CDC has the power to bar you from your own country? Really, where do they get that power? Anyone at the CDC elected? I don't think so. They are a bunch of incompetent public health administrators. Nor, by the way, has the Biden administration announced plans to lift the mask mandate on airplanes. Now, why would the Biden administration be in charge of that? Shouldn't Congress make that call? They're the ones who voted for that mandate. Oh, no, but they didn't. Congress never voted on that mandate. The agencies imposed it. You should know that mandate, by the way, does not apply to private jet service. Most people who fly private don't own the plane. They rent a plane from a jet company. And those companies don't have to comply with the mask mandate because Democratic donors fly on those planes, so they're exempt. The TSA, by the way, announced in August that the airline mask mandate would remain in place at least through March 18. Congress had no role in this.  Congress voted to spend trillions of dollars on COVID relief, but nobody in the Congress ever voted on a mandate for masks on airplanes. Will we have it forever? I don't know. You've been taking your shoes off since Richard Reid tried to ignite his 20 years ago. No one ever voted on that, either. None of this is democracy. Not when they make you take your shoes off. Not when they make you cover your face. Those decisions are too important for you to weigh in on. It's not democracy. So the pandemic is over, but people like Kathy Hochul still have emergency powers and school boards do, too. They're acting like they have complete power over your children. In Naperville, Illinois, a court just issued a restraining order against Governor Pritzker's statewide school mask mandate. The school board? Simply ignoring it. So on Monday, parents fought back. They're doing to the school board what the truckers are doing to Justin Trudeau, and let's hope it has the same effect. Keep in mind they're in that meeting because the school board is ignoring a lawful court order, and of course, blowing off the parents they serve. Now the answer to all of this is really simple. Strip these reckless morons of their monarchical powers and return this country to democracy. Why is that hard? "	slams Democratic politicians creating mass hysteria pandemic pretty fascinating latest internal polling restrictions seen must pretty awful apocalyptic something spooked bad less

765	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-how-long-before-protests-like-this-come-here	2022-02-07 23:31:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: How long before protests like the 'Freedom Convoy' come to America? | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues leaders are trying to intimidate truckers for speaking out. Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains. That's from Karl Marx, of course. He wrote that famous phrase in 1848. The weird thing is, it's pretty likely that Marx himself never met an actual worker.  Wait a second. He didn't spend a decade in a cotton mill, witnessing the oppression firsthand. No. Karl Marx never spent a moment in a factory. He was a rich kid who became a journalist. Of course he was. But for more than 150 years, Karl Marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it.  Over time, workers became working men or working class and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. Ordinary people, wage earners, are getting shafted, so they've got to unite. They've got to come together for protection and for dignity. This was the idea, of course, behind the organized labor movement, and every Democratic president from Andrew Jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again. ""The noble people of Scranton..."" You hear it even today. So, Democrats have repeated that line often enough. You would think they really mean it.  Do they really mean it? Let's take the test. Here's how you know. Watch what happens when actual workers, working people from working families who constitute the working class, actually come together as a group to protest how things are going.  What happens then? Does the intellectual class greet these workers as heroes? Throw a parade? Listen intently to their stories? Does NPR do a sympathetic feature on them? Or, do self-described progressives recoil in revulsion and horror at the grubbiness of the people who as we used to say, work for a living? Do liberals immediately denounce them as Nazis and call for their suppression by force? That's the question. What's the answer? We'll ask  voters what happens. They'll know. Or consider what's happening right now in Canada. Thousands of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of Justin Trudeau's government. Justin Trudeau does not like truck drivers. He thinks they're revolting. Justin Trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls, the only people who give him money. Trudeau is not in Ottawa right now. In fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they've been in hiding ever since. So when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, Justin Trudeau wasn't there to see it. He ran away in terror, kind of sad.  So instead, in his place, his friend Mark Carney has been speaking for him. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive who many believe will replace Justin Trudeau if Trudeau ever decides to give up power. In a recent op-ed, Mark Carney vented his rage at the impudent truckers in Ottawa and anyone who sent them money on the internet.  ""Anyone sending money to the convoy should be in no doubt,"" Carney wrote. ""You are funding sedition. Foreign funders of an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.""  Got it? That is not a protest. It's sedition. It's an insurrection. Clearly, Mark Carney's been watching a lot of CNN up there in Canada and that's why he's concluded the truckers should be crushed by force.  ""Those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of the law."" People who sent the money should be prosecuted. If they're not prosecuted, Mark Carney fears, ""the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.""   Are you laughing yet? So, the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. Hilarious. It'll be interesting, by the way, to pull small business owners in Ottawa to see what they think. How did they feel about the truckers? Some of you know exactly what those results would be, but no one's doing that poll, of course. Instead, they found an easier way. Justin Trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down. How do you do that? How do you stop a truck protest? Simple. You seize their fuel. That's exactly what police in Canada are doing.  OK, so we are, through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. So, let's pause a moment to savor the irony here. The very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working-class Canadians who are trying to stay alive in Arctic temperatures.  As they used to say in the 1960s, ""scratch a liberal, and you will find a fascist."" That was a Black Panther slogan, actually. They weren't entirely stupid. In fact, in this case, they were absolutely right.  According to Justin Trudeau, possessing gasoline in the city of Ottawa is now a crime. Now, to be clear, Ottawa didn't declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire or shot someone or leveled a church. BLM did all of those things, but Justin Trudeau strongly supports BLM.  He reaffirmed to support the other day. Here's the problem. We're going to let the mayor of Ottawa explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to Canada.  They've got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of Ottawa, let's hurt them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a dark scene in Truckistan tonight. The kids are on the bouncy castles. Of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime. One protester, a clear White supremacist, explained his motives for protest.  Shut up, racist. Go back to Jamaica with your White supremacy nonsense. By the way, no one in Canada's government or the media in Canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. Instead, they've gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. They don't have an argument to make. All they have is police power and they're using them. Officials in Ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the California company GoFundMe because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. Here's Ottawa's police chief bragging about stealing that money:  Intelligence operations? This is a peaceful, political protest. No one has shown any evidence to the contrary. It's not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. It's not . These are Canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they're being treated like a terror group. GoFundMe announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably BLM, which it has supported since the very beginning. In other words, GoFundMe planned to steal that money.  They were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of American attorneys general who threatened to sue the companies. So the company backed off and they're going to refund the money, supposedly. But still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it. So, in the absence of GoFundMe doing what it's supposed to do, others are filling the gap. An alternative crowdfunding website called Give Send Go has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. How long till they try to shut that down too?  Some Canadians are clearly worried about that. They're turning to cryptocurrency. Tally Coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It's not controlled by banks. That's the point. They're hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don't control crypto. Bitcoin goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two.  It's pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they'll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.  Either way, it's becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. That doesn't apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. You can't organize if you can't talk to other people. So Facebook, for example, to shut down the ""Convoy to D.C. Group,"" which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. No one's allowed to promote the organization anymore. Facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in Canada. Of course they are. That seems like a story, but our media have ignored it. Instead, everyone in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with Silicon Valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. It makes sense. CNN REPORTER:   It's spreading like a contagion. Now, you knew that CNN was the praetorian guard for our ruling class. Did you know they serve the same role in Canada and what other countries? How much money to CNN take from the government of Canada? That'd be worth finding out.   They described what's happening in Ottawa as a, ""violent and dangerous demonstration."" Really? Where's the violence coming from? The only people getting injured or have been injured so far are the protesters, the truckers.   In Winnipeg on Friday, an anarchist called David Zegarac drove his jeep into four people who were protesting vaccine mandates. Zegarac didn't stop after hitting the people he fled. Police were legally arrested him. Of course, police are treating the incident like a hit and run. Nothing political. It's not domestic terrorism or anything. David Zegarac, his views, they agree with. He's a progressive, a true believer. How much is he a true believer?  If you look closely, you'll notice that Zegarac has his mask on driving alone in his car during the assault, prima facie evidence of mental illness, something you see in this country all the time, and it makes you wonder: if you're driving alone with a mask on, do you pose a danger to pedestrians? Entirely possible. Someone should fund a study on that. That seems like a big story, especially since it's happening just an hour from our own border, all of this.  The question is: How long before protests like this come here? Clearly, our media are worried about that. Watch the morning news anchors on MSNBC. They're deeply, deeply concerned about these uppity working-class people. Watch. So here you have Joe and Mika sneering from their studio in Florida at the freezing wage earners stuck outside in Ottawa in February because they want their human rights. Screw them! Well, Joe Scarborough say that to their faces? Probably not.  Scarborough's famously tough on young female employees. Some say he's an absolute killer in the office, but it's hard to imagine Scarborough talking like this if there was an actual Canadian trucker in the room. Truckers in this country are watching all of this, and you wonder: what do they think about it? What would happen if American truck drivers decided they'd had enough of people like Joe Scarborough and went on strike? What would happen then? Well, this country would stop immediately, no more deliveries of anything.  Over time that would mean starvation for people in the cities, but even in the short term, there would be profound suffering in this country. For example, and this is something that too few people outside of television even consider, the world's entire supply of Botox is manufactured on the west coast of Ireland. That's a long way from here. In fact, it's a 4,000 mile long supply chain from the Allergan plant in Westport, Ireland to Jupiter, Florida.   Now, people at MSNBC might not be aware of this, but our country has no domestic Botox production, along with vitamin C and antibiotics. It's one of the lifesaving pharmaceutical products we have recklessly offshored. So if the trucks stop delivering, the Botox stops coming and suddenly your morning television anchors are going to look like they're 58 years old, which actually they are. Could that happen? Is it impossible? No, it's not impossible. The people in charge aren't really thinking this through. Most of the time, trends start the United States and they move north to Canada, but this time, the opposite could happen. "	argues leaders trying intimidate truckers speaking Workers world unite

768	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-ukraine-policies-washington-priorities	2022-02-05 00:01:00-05:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden's Ukraine policies reveal how grotesque Washington's priorities are | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host examines White House claims of a potential Russian false flag operation.There aren’t a lot of amazing stories left in ""The New York Times,"" they are all so predictable and self-righteous, but if you read the paper yesterday you did see one. ""U.S. Exposes What It Says Is Russian Effort to Fabricate Pretext for Invasion."" That was the headline. The story explained that at some point very soon, Vladimir Putin plans to stage a fake military attack on his own citizens. Putin will use actors to portray Ukrainian soldiers and Intel operatives committing atrocities against Russians. Then he’s going to videotape the whole thing and secretly release to the world. When people in the West see the clips of that on Facebook they will understand why Putin was justified in invading Ukraine. So it's a Psyop. Pretty diabolical. You may be wondering how exactly how do we know that Vladimir Putin is actually planning to do something like this. Because in real life, the global intelligence world is a very complicated place. People in it rarely tell straightforward truths. So actually,  if you are devising propaganda for the Ukrainian government, this might be exactly the kind of story you would place in ""The New York Times,"" which of course is compliant. They're on your side. A story like this would give you a way to plausibly deny attacking Russian citizens. Is that what happened here? We don’t know. We have no idea if ""The New York Times"" account is true or not. Then again, neither does ""The New York Times."" Right in a story, they conceded that the Biden officials ""would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or specify how they learned of it,"" saying to do so would ""compromise their sources and methods."" Those must be the same sources and methods the CIA is protecting by continuing to hide thousands of documents from 911 two decades ago, or the Kennedy assassination 60 years ago. If you live in Washington you recognize that that is the all-purpose justification for everything. State Department spokesman Ned price knows exactly how this works because Price began his career at the CIA.  Here's what he said at a briefing: Wait a second, what was that? A false flag operation? Really? That is a jarring term to hear from a Joe Biden employee much less an official. Because until yesterday we were under the impression false flag operations didn’t exist. And if they did exist it was only within the diseased imagination of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and his minions in QAnon. That’s what they told us. But now they are telling us that false flag operations are entirely real, except they never happen here. Never in the United States, never in Washington, only in Russia. We will let that digest just for a minute. CIA veteran Ned Price assures us that it is true. Normally that would be the end of it. Reporters would’ve scurried back to the cubicles to write their breathless little stories about Vladimir Putin's false flag operation. And by and large that is exactly what did happen. The stenographers wrote Ned Price’s story. But one of them didn’t. That man’s name is Matt Lee. He’s a State Department reporter for the Associated Press. We know nothing about Matt Lee other than he appears to be a middle-aged man who has been around long enough to ask a skeptical follow-up question or two. In Washington that makes them virtually unique. Lee noticed that Ned Price actually hadn’t said anything that could be checked or even described in meaningful detail. So Lee asked Ned Price, ""What are you actually talking about?"" Here's the exchange that followed. Hold on a second. What are you talking about? That was the question. It was a good question. You wish you heard it more in official briefings, you wish you heard it more in everyday life in this country. It is usually the essential question in the first step towards finding out what the truth is. Ned Price didn’t want to answer that question, but Lee kept pressing him. Why didn’t Matt Lee just take Ned Price’s word for it like everybody else? Maybe because this is the very same Ned Price who has a documented history of lying to reporters in the briefing room. Here is Ned Price promising that Kabul would not fall to the Taliban not long before it did fall to the Taliban:. ""Our partnership will not diminish in any way with the military withdrawal from Afghanistan."" Days after Ned Price said that, the Biden back president of Afghanistan through millions of U.S. dollars into a duffel bag and fled to the United Aram Emirates in a private plane. So actually, the partnership did diminish, pretty quickly in fact. Matt Lee has been around long enough to remember that. He probably also remembers the time Colin Powell promised the country there were WMDs in Iraq. He probably remembers when Hillary Clinton claimed our ambassador in Benghazi was murdered over an Islamic-phobic YouTube video. He probably remembers those two separate occasions, not too long ago, when the entire foreign policy establishment in Washington assured us that evil Bashar al-Assad had gassed his own people with poison gas and deserved to be bombed, but at the same time forgot to show us any evidence that it actually happened. We are still waiting on that evidence, by the way. Matt Lee remembers stuff like that and he mentioned it yesterday.Best question ever: ""Where’s the declassified information other than you coming out here and saying it?"" How thrilling to watch someone ask something so simple. Imagine if the entire press corps acted like that? We might have a decent government.Ned Price seemed completely unprepared for any of this and highly annoyed by it. Nothing in his CIA training had suggested he might encounter disobedient reporters in the White House. So he stuck with what he had which was, ""I said it, therefore it’s true."" It went on and on like this. If you really want to dislike your government, you can look it up for yourself online. We can tell you Ned Price’s superciliousness gets more nauseating as it goes on. It does make you wonder about the CIA. Do they hire people oily on this purpose? Where do they find people like this? Well, The Georgetown School of Foreign Service, of course. We tell you just one more portion of this exchange in which Matt Lee flips the usual script and accuses Ned Price of sounding like a crazed conspiracy nut. It’s beautiful. . One correction, Alex Jones lies far less and is far more credible than Ned Price is. You see the point. Ned Price lost that exchange. He claimed to have information that he did not have, and Matt Lee persistently called him out on it. So Ned Price ran out of B.S. The B.S. barrel was empty. So what did Ned Price do then? Ned Price did what they all do when they are cornered. He went right to the lowest personal attack. He didn’t call Matt Lee racist, he’s probably saving that for next week, but he did suggest Matt Lee is more sympathetic to Russia than he is to his own country, the United States. He implied Matt Lee is a shill for Vladimir Putin. At an earlier age, this is the point where Matt Lee would’ve gone to the podium and punched him right in the face. There was a time in this country when calling a man disloyal was a grave and serious charge. You could not let that stand. That’s not true anymore, we’re so used to it now. We hear it constantly. On Wednesday, two days ago, during a closed-door briefing in Congress on Russia, Jim Cooper of Tennessee, a Democrat, asked an intelligence briefer to find out if this show is tied to Russia. We are not tied to Russia, of course. It’s a cable television program. We are not a diplomatic mission. Jim Cooper knows that. But that is not the point. The point is: We have criticized the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy. So in retaliation for that, Jim Cooper has asked the intel agencies to dig up dirt on us. To be clear, that is not allowed. It is illegal to use the U.S. Government to settle partisan scores or to silence opposition journalists. It is also, by the way, illegal to secretly monitor their electronic communications. But Joe Biden’s NSA did that to this show this summer. That happened. We are not speculating about it. The NSA admitted it. And congressman Cooper admitted what he did today when we asked him, though he was too cowardly to come on tonight to explain how he could justify that. This is scary behavior. It is also revealing. After a full year of governing, all the Biden Administration could muster when challenged are ad hominem attacks and more spying from the intel agents. Let’s put the intel agencies on. What they can’t do is explain themselves. They don’t even try. That is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of rot, it’s a sign of weakness. And yet they are doing it and getting away with it. How are they getting away with it? Very simple, they are getting away with it because Republicans are allowing them to get away with it. Screaming about Russia, even as we ignore China, is now a bipartisan effort. You remember Russia-gate. You thought Republicans would never fall for that again? No, they internalize the whole thing. They now believe Russia is our greatest enemy. They are the existential threat. All eyes on Putin. They could stop this tomorrow. If Mitch McConnell criticized the build-up to the war with Putin, it would end immediately. If five Republicans held a press conference tomorrow to declare that the territorial integrity of the United States is more important than the territorial integrity of Ukraine, this couldn’t continue. The lunacy would end. But they are not doing that. Instead, Republicans are every bit as hysterical about Russia as Adam Schiff ever was.  Lindsey Graham just admits I’m on Biden’s inside, but most of them are too clever to do that. They are doing something you may not notice at first. They are attacking Joe Biden for being weak. His weaknesses is inviting aggression. And on the basis of that, they are in fact agreeing with Biden and supporting his Russia policy. Got that? We are against Biden. That is why we are backing him up and his Russian policy. Pretty clever. Is that what Republican voters want? Let’s see. If you ask them, they probably say why don’t we send as much military equipment to the Texas border as we did to the Russian border? If someone says it out loud, that may be the entire country could assess how grotesque Washington’s priorities are. Speaking of grotesque priorities, Senator John Cornyn represents Texas. Texas is a state that’s had well over 1 million foreign nationals pour into it illegally over the last year. Right over the border. That is a far bigger invasion than anything Vladimir Putin is planning in Ukraine. And yet when John Cornyn talks about border security, he’s not talking about his own state or even his own country. He’s talking about Ukrainian border security. These are people who sit in committee meetings often with closed doors. What are they doing? Well they are apparently sicking the intel agencies on anyone who criticizes them. But are they getting unfiltered information from those intel agencies? Are they making wise decisions on the basis of it? Do have any idea what they are talking about? No, of course not. They cloak their ignorance in the usual cliches. Freedom-loging democracies like Ukraine. But the truth is, their interests, their beliefs are so far out of alignment with the interests and beliefs of the average person in this country, including their own voters, that once that is exposed to light, they are in trouble. Last point, this is only happening because there is no credible opposition to it in the Congress. "	examines White House claims potential Russian false flag operation
