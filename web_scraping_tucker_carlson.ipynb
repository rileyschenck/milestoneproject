      "Fox News host gives his take on pro-abortion protesters targeting Supreme Court justices over the possible overturn of Roe v. Wade on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It's pretty hard to argue with people who are passive-aggressive. You may have tried it before. \"Why are you so angry?\" they scream. \"Stop being violent,\" they snarl as they punch you in the face. Passive-aggressive people are intent on dominating you, but they're too dishonest to admit it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's not an honorable style of attack, but it's very effective, mostly because it's so bewildering. The Democratic Party practices this. Democrats will never meet you on an open field of battle. Instead, they will sneak up behind you and knock you unconscious with a bag of sanctimony. This is the party of weak men and angry women, so passive aggression is their only mode of communication. If you've ever seen one of Jen Psaki's press conferences, you know exactly what we're talking about. \n",
      "\n",
      "We watched one of them yesterday, in fact. It was her last. Peter Doocy asked Psaki what the administration thinks of the fact that liberal groups have posted the home addresses of conservative Supreme Court justices on the internet. Now, why are they doing this? Well, it's obvious why they're doing it and no one denies why they're doing it. They're doing it in order to frighten those justices into changing their votes on Roe v. Wade. Now, that's illegal. It's very clearly a federal crime. It's also, by the way, the road to chaos and collapse. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can't allow angry mobs to make your country's laws. That's why we banned lynching, but Jen Psaki did not have a problem with this. People are understandably upset with Sam Alito's views, she said, so you shouldn't be surprised they want to express that concern in person by screaming at Sam Alito and his family. \"I don't have an official U.S. government position on where people should protest.\" Really, Jen Psaki? Are those the rules now? How would you feel if angry protesters showed up outside, say, Michelle Obama's house?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, they'd be thrown into thumbscrews within minutes and charged with racism and you would applaud as they languished in jail. But conservative Supreme Court justices? No, that's a different story because conservative Supreme Court justices deserve it. That's Jen Psaki's position, but it is not, in fact, since we've been speaking of this topic, the official position of the U.S. government.  \n",
      "\n",
      "No, according to 18 U.S, Code 1507, the official position of the U.S. government is you're not allowed to intimidate judges, period: \"Whoever with the intent of interfering with, obstructing or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness or court officer in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building, housing a court of the United States or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness or court officer, or with such intent, uses any sound truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence shall be fined or imprisoned.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, it's very clearly a crime. Jen Psaki either didn't know this or far more likely didn't care because as far as the Biden administration is concerned, Justice Alito is responsible for the threats against his family. If you don't want to be targeted by a mob that don't write opinions, the mob doesn't like, dumbo. You did this to yourself. It's your fault we're hurting you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's always the position of passive-aggressive people and it's the position of the passive-aggressive party. So, we recognized it immediately because we watch this stuff for a living, and then we saw this, and it made us think. This ran on CNN this morning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, for days, we have assumed, based on quite a bit of evidence, that the main threat to Supreme Court justices right now and to our justice system itself comes from groups of activist liberals who are enraged by the idea that Roe v. Wade might be repealed. These are the people who are spray-painting churches and are putting Sam Alito's home address on the internet. They're the mob, and they're angry, and we know why they're angry. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the whole thing made sense to us, but according to CNN, that's not what's happening. In fact, it's the opposite of what's happening. The real threat, CNN informed us this morning, comes not from people who are angry about Sam Alito's opinion, but from people who are happy about it. So, the ones who are celebrating what Sam Alito wrote are the ones who are the real danger to the Supreme Court. Watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "You got that? Law enforcement sources tell CNN the real threat here is the far right. The far-right? Fences are going up outside the Supreme Court because the far-right poses a threat. The far-right is the one you have to watch out for. They're the ones whose electronic communications you've got to \" monitor closely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And that makes sense. Now that Roe v. Wade may be going away, these people are going to want to bomb as many abortion clinics as they can and hurt as many Supreme Court justices as possible. After all, the Supreme Court may get rid of a law that they have hated for 50 years. So, you can see why they would be moved to violence against the Supreme Court. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, our first response to this was to laugh. It seems too absurd to be real. How dumb do they think we are? And then we remembered what the President of the United States and his attorney general have been telling us for more than a year. They've been telling us that no matter what happens, no matter what it may look like, the people who did it didn't vote for us. Yeah. The people who didn't vote for us are the dangerous ones. It's always their fault. Watch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not al-Qaeda, White supremacy.\" So, when we reviewed those tapes, it started to make sense. Like the Mongols and the Visigoths before them, these dreaded White supremacists have declared war on civilization, these Trump voters, and the evidence that is all around us. We've just ignored it because in some level, we don't want to know, but in retrospect, it was always right in front of us. You recall when Trump voters looted that Macy's in New York City. They couldn't help themselves. That's who they are. Then they torched a police precinct in Minneapolis, the very symbol of the law, they set it on fire. And then they burned a federal building in Portland, Oregon.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In case you've forgotten what all of these right-wing attacks look like from White supremacists, here's what they did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, you can see why they're putting up barriers in front of the Supreme Court. Those people are so happy with Sam Alito's opinion, they might start burning and looting again and of course, that would be consistent with the years-long reign of right-wing terror we've been living through because their thirst for anarchy and chaos is never sated. At one point, these Trump voters seceded from the United States. They set up their own nation of lawlessness, drugs and squalor and violence within the very city limits of Seattle, just like the Confederates of 1861, but with more weed and spray paint—right in the middle of Seattle. Talk about brazen, but that's who they are. That could happen in your town. \n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder America's abortionist community is cowering in fear tonight, and it gets worse. These MAGA people have so little respect for law and order, they think nothing of rushing into buildings, department stores, Walgreens, liquor stores, Foot Locker and just taking what they want. They steal armfuls of merchandise off the shelves and walk out the door like it's theirs and then purely to amuse themselves, they push strangers in front of trains and open fire on subway cars. They drive trucks through Christmas parades and beat elderly Asian women on the street. You can't control these people because they're beyond the reach of logic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They are so primitive and superstitious, they have come to believe they can defeat nature itself with magic amulets like cosmetics and women's clothing. They think they're shapeshifters who can change their physical form at will and just become something different. You're seeing one on your screen right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "People like this don't believe in history or science. They're barely literate, so they communicate instead in grunts and unintelligible sounds. Here's the leader, the chief of their tribe, speaking in a language only they can understand:\n",
      "\n",
      "What did he just say? We don't know. You'd have to be a right supremacist MAGA person to understand. It's an esoteric language. These primitives adorn their bodies with fantastic decorations. They dress in costume. Some even push pieces of metal through their faces in order to look fierce. Look at them in their war paint.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret Mead wrote about people like this, antisocial elements that are a feature of any society, but in our case, the MAGA people number in the millions. You saw just a few on your screen and because there are so many, they threaten the very foundations of our civil society, just like Alejandro Mayorkas and the attorney general have warned us. They are so powerful that courts and legislators bow before their rage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors can't even restrain them, but instead do their bidding. Why? Because they're afraid not to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you remember what the MAGA people did to Minneapolis when a jury dared to convict their spiritual leader, Derek Chauvin? The MAGA people stormed the jail, freed Chauvin. They carried him on their shoulders back to their guerrilla camps in the mountains where they danced rampantly before bonfires made of back issues of the Atlantic magazine, howling into the night sky, and then, as an indelible lesson to the rest of us, they returned to the city of Minneapolis and sacked it because that's what they do when they don't agree with the jury decision, they riot.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what the MAGA people are like and that's why they're the greatest threat we face. Do you remember that moment? We saved the tape. Ladies and gentlemen, here are the MAGA people.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We'd play more, but it's stomachturning. Ask Jen Psaki what it looked like. She's never recovered from it.  \n",

      "Fox News host shreds Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as Americans experience record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was six years ago and one of those semi-hilarious moments that has unfortunately been lost to history that Janet Yellen sat through what must have been the single most uncomfortable congressional hearing of her life. At the time, you may remember, Yellen was running the Federal Reserve and she was, as she remains today, a lifestyle liberal in good standing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, put yourself in her position and imagine the shock she must have felt when members of the Congressional Black Caucus suggested that she, Janet Yellen, was, in fact, a racist, maybe even a White supremacist. What did Janet Yellen do wrong? Well, they suggested what she did wrong was she failed to harness the power of the Federal Reserve to help African-Americans specifically. Now, at first, Yellen seemed confused by this complaint. The point of the Fed is to keep the American economy stable. The point is not to pay off loyal blocks of Democratic voters, and she tried to explain this.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our powers,\" she said, \"can't be targeted at the experience of particular groups.\" That was her response, but the Congressional Black Caucus did not buy it. Their message to Janet Yellen was the same as their message to you and every other person in this country with 350 million people: \"Do what we say, or we will denounce you as a racist.\" And finally, Janet Yellen got that message. Boy, did she.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Within a year, Yellen had all but abandoned the traditional constraints of monetary policy. Instead, there she was yammering on in public about things like racial equity and environmental justice. Now, those are issues that, unlike economics, cannot be quantified or even specifically defined. They are therefore perfect vehicles for power-hungry politicians hoping to become more powerful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Yellen was supposedly an economist. But as she turned 70, she left the field of economics completely and entered the far more familiar world of political activism. By the time she became Joe Biden's Treasury Secretary, the transformation was complete. Among Yellen's first acts as Treasury secretary was an order changing the mission of the Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that council was created by Congress after the last financial crisis, as its name suggests, to prevent something similar from ever happening again. And for about a decade, it focused on questions that might prevent another meltdown, questions like subprime lending and automated trading on Wall Street, relevant questions, but under Janet Yellen, the council turned its attention to a far more fashionable issue that she was consumed with: global warming.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must look ahead at emerging risks,\" Yellen proclaimed, \"Climate change is obviously the big one.\" She sent a letter to the World Bank telling them the same thing. As for inflation, which traditionally was a core concern of government economists, that was the emerging risk they were worried about, Yellen Just shrug that off. Inflation? If that happens, she told us in a now-famous quote, it'll be \"transitory.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "In the history of bad predictions from Washington, which could fill volumes, that might take first place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, since Joe Biden became president, the , and so have the prices of many other key commodities that Americans need to live and the worst part is that not only did Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, fail to see any of this coming. Janet Yellen, more than any other single person in America, caused it in the first place through reckless, loose money policies implemented during her years at the Fed, policies that were bound to cause inflation and did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're mad about the current state of the economy, Janet Yellen is probably the first person you should blame. Why does she still have her job? It's a good question. And we might have had an answer to that because Yellen was back in front of Congress today, but this time there were no tough interrogatories from the Congressional Black Caucus. No one called her a racist. Instead, they kissed up to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Yellen explained to a deeply sympathetic room of members of Congress, the real problem with the American economy is that she and the Democratic Party don't yet have enough control over it. Watch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So just for fun, if you have 5 minutes, rewind the tape, transcribe what she just said, and see if you can make sense of the verbal bouillabaisse. What are you looking at? It's called intersectionalism. It's the new religion of government, and it allows bureaucrats when it becomes clear they have no idea what they're doing to just pivot and talk about something they know even less about. So. here you have Janet Yellen talking about geopolitical influences, clean energy credits, climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is  talking about? Well, she has no idea. The problem is that there are people out there who actually do understand what she's trying to talk about. Experts, actual experts, have studied the sustainability of renewable energy for years.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Michael Shellenberger, for example, found that from 2011 to 2017, the cost of solar panels dropped by more than 70% in this country. There are more of them. It's a supply and demand question. But here's the interesting part. During that same period as the cost of solar panels fell, electricity prices in California went up five times more than they did in the rest of the United States. Why more solar panels? The solar panels were cheaper, but the electricity they produced was more expensive. Huh? How does that work and how is it helping you?  \n",
      "\n",
      "We know it happens because it happened in Germany at scale from 2006 to 2018. That would be the heyday, the peak years of Germany's big renewable energy push. Electricity prices went up 50%. Now, why did that happen? Well, let's compare it to a neighboring country. In France, electricity prices were much lower than Germany's even though France gets twice as much of its energy from clean energy sources as Germany does.\n",
      "\n",
      "What? What made France so special? How'd they pull that off? Simple. Nuclear. \n",
      "\n",
      "France gets a lot of its energy from nuclear power. Janet Yellen does not consider nuclear power a renewable. When she says renewable, she means wind and solar, which by definition are not reliable sources of energy, but they are and this is always the key, highly profitable to Democratic donors and the government of China.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, of course, Janet Yellen is for them. Of course, Yellen didn't go into details on why she thinks what she does, because if you unpack it, if you slow down and speak clearly, it doesn't make any sense and Janet Yellen knows that. She's an activist. She gets that logic is irrelevant. Thinking clearly? No, that gets you nowhere. Emotion is what carries the day, and that's why during today's congressional hearings, she started talking about yet another topic she knows nothing about – gun crime.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm horrified about gun violence.\" I'm sorry, ma'am, you're the Treasury secretary. Shh, let's talk about the economy, which is imploding. Stop with your little abortion talk, your little gun talk. Not your area. Let's get back into your lane. You're the  secretary, but of course, she doesn't want to.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal always is to talk about anything other than the economy. Why? Because they destroyed the economy, but there was one exception. At one point, Janet Yellen was asked because it's a pretty obvious question, how exactly as the Treasury secretary and former Fed chair, as an economist and a genius, how do you miss the inflation you caused? Hear when. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, so you didn't see  even though it was here for two years and we shut down the entire economy and then made up for the gap in productivity with profligate government spending where we just printed trillions of fake dollars, but you didn't think that was going to cause inflation somehow? And you didn't think a war in the breadbasket of Europe would affect food prices? \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you were a talk show host on a cable channel with no economic experience whatsoever or even the ability to balance a checkbook and it was obvious to you, but, you're the Treasury secretary, but you didn't see it coming? Maybe you shouldn't call it transitory? And your answer is, and we're quoting, \"I do expect inflation to remain high, although I do very much hope it will be coming down.\" Oh, you very much hope? Is that where we are? We are very much hoping? Tell us more about abortion and gun violence if you would. Blame COVID and Putin and call it a day. It is a joke.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Fox's Hillary Vaughn, to her credit, was not convinced. She asked Janet Yellen whether Joe Biden's decision to spend trillions of dollars might have contributed to inflation because like when you have more of something, it's worth less, like your currency, which is almost worth less and here was Janet Yellen's response.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Go away, peasant, troll, your inflation talk. I'm worried about climate change and gun violence and abortion. Leave me alone, it's not like the Treasury secretary. Be gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "She should be gone. This is crazy. And in a functioning country, Janet Yellen would be in a retirement home somewhere writing her memoirs that no one would ever read, but that's not what's happening. She's still the Treasury secretary, and that's not what happened today. Instead, Democrats took turns bragging about their expensive electric cars. Worried about gas prices? Just get a Tesla, baby.

      "You're telling us that the oil companies are so greedy they somehow canceled their own leases for drilling. They're so greedy. They don't even want to drill oil and that's why they shut down their own pipelines. Is that right? And that's why they're talking about implementing a gas tax, because they don't want you to use oil. Right?  \n",
