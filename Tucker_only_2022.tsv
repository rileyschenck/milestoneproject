Happy New Year, we've got some good news for you. 2022 is going to be an improvement over the last two years. We can say that with confidence. How do we know? It's simple. The  lunacy is finally going to end and not by the way, because of anything that's happening in the world of medicine. The pandemic itself may burn out thanks to this weakened new variant. We may also find highly effective medicines to treat it. In fact, we already have. 

But as a practical matter, scientific developments are usually irrelevant to COVID policy. They always have been. So the reason things are going to improve has nothing to do with medicine. It's that the current rules and superstitions are just too stupid and crazy to continue. At some point, probably soon, even the  own voters are going to stop putting up with it. You can bet on that. 

To prove it will begin with two images tonight, the first is the President of the United States, . Now Biden is the safest man in the world. Hundreds of federal employees spend their entire lives making certain that no harm comes to Joe Biden. When you're the president, your personal doctor is never more than a few steps away. An ambulance follows you the minute you leave the house. You can have any treatment you want at any time you want. As many  as you care to take. Nobody in history has received more attentive medical care than Joe Biden is getting right now. He's the last person on Earth who should be worried about COVID-19, and yet he's terrified. 

Biden was on the beach last week. He's outside. It's a breezy day. There's no one around but his own triple vaxxed wife, the woman he claims to share a bed with. You'd think Joe Biden would consider this a safe environment, but no, he wore a little surgical mask as he walks through the sand. 

What you've got to ask yourself, does Joe Biden imagine is going to hurt him? And how is the little mask supposed to help? Is he worried about wave-borne viruses, clouds of pathogens floating over the Atlantic from the Azores infected seagulls? We don't know. It's impossible to know the answers because it's all so completely bonkers. These are not rational fears. These are monsters under the bed night terrors. This is textbook hysteria. It's a kind of mental illness. That's your president. 

Here's your . His name is Lloyd Austin. This summer he emerged from his plane on a tour of the Philippines more afraid of the coronavirus even than Joe Biden is. Biden wears a surgical mask. Lloyd Austin wears a welding helmet with a surgical mask underneath and underneath that, there's as much MRNA vaccine in Lloyd Austin's bloodstream as the law will allow. Lloyd Austin is ready to wage a protracted siege against COVID. Think of the Romans at Masada. Austin as the leader of the Branch Covidians. 

And yet somehow, in some way a chink must have appeared in Lloyd Austin's formidable corona armor, a gap in his viral fortifications. Yesterday, Lloyd Austin announced that despite his many vaccinations, he has contracted COVID and it's serious enough they won't be going to work for a while. So what's the lesson that Lloyd Austin is taking from this? Well, that the vaccines work perfectly and because they work so well, they will remain mandatory in the armed services. We can fire more SEALs. Austin wrote that in the same statement in which he announced the vaccines that he took didn't work. Quote the vaccines work and will remain a  medical requirement for our workforce. Right. Because that's not completely irrational or anything. But it is completely irrational. And every clear-thinking person knows that it is. 

But wait, you say, I've been watching television news, so I know that the vax was never designed to stop infection or transmission or even hospitalization and death, none of which as a factual matter it does stop. No, the point of the vaccines was always to make your symptoms a little better. That's a reassuring metric that's usefully difficult to measure, though strangely, no one seems reassured by it. But from day one, that was the advertised benefit of these vaccines. That's what many people appear to believe, but it's not true. And since so many people seem to have forgotten what the authorities were saying just a few months ago, we have saved those tapes. 

Quote, you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. That was Joe Biden this July. Poor old guy. Biden's preference for simple, childlike sentences is so often his undoing, as in this case, there is no mistaking what he actually meant. Take the shot and you won't get COVID. Well, that turned out to be untrue, to put it mildly. How many vaccinated people do you know right now who have COVID or have just recovered from COVID? It seems like millions of people who dutifully got the vaccine also got corona over this past Christmas vacation. You probably know a lot. You may be one of them. And in fact, it's possible there's a connection between these two facts. Research suggests that it's possible the vaccinated are more likely to get and transmit this virus than the unvaccinated are. Whatever the final verdict, now we don't know, what is clear is that people who've had the shot can easily get infected and easily give it to others. The epicenter of the latest outbreak was the most vaccinated city in the country . 

So at this point, there is no remaining doubt the experts were completely wrong about what the vaccines could do, and to be honest, that's OK. We're not attacking them. It is not a crime to be wrong. We've been wrong. There are a lot of wrong guesses in science, as there are in life. Science is not a volume of established knowledge, science is a way of thinking. It's a process of seeking the truth. And very often in scientific research, you discover that your assumptions were totally off. So you just adjust from there. Viagra started out as a heart medication. 

There's nothing immoral about any of that. You just have to admit that you were wrong. That's the requirement. You cannot lie. Lying is the enemy of science. If you are still pretending that the COVID vaccines work as advertised, you are a liar. There's no way around it. You have no place in public health or even hosting a show on CNN. You're doing too much damage to the country. No one will ever believe you or anyone like you ever again. 

So that's the first thing we've got to do if we're going to go from this disaster to a better future, we've got to insist that the people in charge stop lying about COVID. They have been lying since the first day lying about everything, including the most basic public health stats that we used to rely on. When they told you that the  were exempt from quarantine regulations, supporting the policy goals of the Democratic Party was virtuous. Therefore, thousands of people –   members with BLM signs – could not, possibly as an epidemiological matter, be dangerous. That really happened. They really said that. And people, the public actually put up with it. And that's when you knew for certain that our politicians were totally corrupt and that our citizenry was far too compliant. Here's , the former mayor of New York. 

It's a historic moment of change. That's the guy in charge of health policy in our biggest city, actually, de Blasio is gone now, but for some reason his hastily issued COVID proclamations remain in force in New York City. Why? Because everyone's afraid to ignore them, despite the fact they make no sense. So whose fault is that? Honestly, it's our fault. If we want better politicians, we have to be better citizens. What does that mean? It means following common sense, and the tug of our own consciences before we submit to absurd and transparently political dictates. It means telling the truth about our leaders who lie. We have no reason to be ashamed when we do that. They do. 

Unfortunately,  is not ashamed, he never will be ashamed, he's 81. He's been lying for a long time. He's also he often tells us he’s an august man of science, someone ought to ask Tony Fauci how many biological sexes there are. That'd be pretty amusing. In any case, here's Fauci the liar admitting that he lied. This is from last Wednesday. He lied about how many kids have been hospitalized from COVID.

Oh, so it turns out it wasn't COVID, after all, the kids didn't really have COVID in a bad way. COVID isn't really a threat to kids. Looks like the conspiracy theorists who are now banned from Twitter were right all along, the official numbers were fake. Those kids were in the hospital for broken bones and appendicitis not COVID. Tony Fauci, for his own political reasons, has finally admitted this, but it's too late. He spent two years crushing the weakest among us, and they are indeed crushed. 

Imagine wearing a mask to . Imagine never seeing your teacher's face or watching your friends laugh. Imagine being older. Imagine spending junior year of high school alone in your room with only the internet for company. What would happen to you? You'd be badly damaged. Kids in America have been badly damaged. The numbers show it clearly this is a crime. No one has been prosecuted for the crime. No one likely ever will be prosecuted for it. But once again, we have saved the tape, if only so the reality of what frauds like Tony Fauci have done to young people will not be forgotten. Here's the scene, for example, at a public  in Washington state, the spring.

Band practice inside plastic pods, it's grotesque, it's amusing in a way. We'll watch that video 10 years from now in slackjawed disbelief where they realized that nuts in 2021. Yes, they were. But really, it's not a joke. Treating healthy children like they're untouchables is mean as hell. It's a very destructive thing to do. It's immoral. These kids weren't hurting anyone. They couldn't hurt anyone. And yet our public health authorities hurt them, mostly because they could so that 81-year-old Tony Fauci could feel safe. Their childhoods were destroyed. Was it worth it? No, it was not worth it. 

Healthy societies work to make certain the youngest generations thrive. They're the ones who carry on civilization. What our leaders have done to young people over the last two years is unforgivable, and we should never allow anything like that to happen again. The next time the , the rest of us should stop immediately what we're doing. Find out what's causing it and fix it. Nothing's more important than that. 

And while we're at it one more thing, the last two years have unleashed an awful lot of cruelty in our society, you see it everywhere. , a former adviser to George W. Bush, proposed that hospitals should withhold lifesaving medical treatment from anyone who won't get the shot. It's grotesque, but no one in authority denounced Frum's idea. Many doctors applauded it. It's hard to imagine something like that happening even two years ago. It's too cruel. Americans didn't used to talk about each other like this. Now it's very common. What does it tell you? It tells you that Americans are dangerously angry. We need to fix that. The people in charge have done the opposite. They've done nothing to calm the population. They've stoked the rage and they've leveraged it. Why? Because they benefit when the American population is divided against itself. 

Joe Biden actually went on television a few weeks ago to explain that unvaccinated Americans have no right to use American hospitals. So much for health care as a human right. That was the Democratic Party's old talking point. Now it's obey or die. What does this go? You know where it goes? The next step, of course, is internal passports fully digitized, so there's no escape. You'll do what the Democratic Party commands, or you will stay in your home. You will no longer have a right to travel freely within your own country. That's not a conspiracy theory. People are saying it out loud. It's coming. Momentum is building for it right now. There's no pushback. 

 in Washington have done nothing to stop this. They're focused on their own hobby, another round of nation-building a brand-new war in eastern Ukraine. They're contemptible.

But where does it leave the rest of us? Well, it's up to the public to apply the brakes to what is certainly the most threatening idea ever proposed in the United States. American citizens are the only hope. The good news is we think they're probably equal to it.

One of the weirdest features in modern life has to be how we've all been trained to ignore the things that really matter. You might have wondered — to pick just one of many examples — why hundreds of thousands of your fellow Americans seem to be living in squalor on the sidewalk. How did that happen? These are the so-called . Drugs have destroyed their lives. So where are those drugs come from, exactly? And why is no one asking? And speaking of chemicals, men in America seem very different from what they used to be. Anyone over 40 knows this, the changes are dramatic you can't help but notice. Could those changes have something to do with the unprecedented drop in testosterone levels that scientists have measured repeatedly? And by the way, if that's happening, why is it happening, and so on? 

There's so many questions like this. We rarely talk about any of them. Instead, we're told repeatedly to avert our gaze from the obvious and turn instead to CNN's latest fixation. Whether it's a , or , or some forgettable border dispute in eastern . These are the issues they tell us we must care about. But they're wrong. These are not the most important issues, they're just news stories The only remarkable thing about them is our willingness to believe they're more important than, say, Americans living outdoors on the sidewalk, or whether or not our own children get married. There's something a little scary about watching this happen. It's like an entire population transfixed by issues that ultimately don't really matter. 

How is that going to work out? Well, over time, probably not very well. Reality always reasserts itself. Twitter can ban all the thought criminals at once, but in the end  is not in charge of the future Nature is in charge of the future. If you want your country to continue, you have to answer nature's imperatives, which are the basics: Do you have enough water? Do you have a reliable food supply? Can you defend yourself from invaders? What are you using for energy? How are you producing things and keeping warm? Those are the essential questions that any civilization must ask those and one other: how many people do you want living in your country? 

The size of your population matters very much. The size determines a nation's character. It often determines its fate. Yet we don't talk much about the size of our population. We probably should. The United States is growing faster than most Americans understand. If you were born in 1969, and some of us were, you arrived in a country with a little over 200 million people in it. There are now 334 million people in it. That's an awful lot of new people in an awfully short time. How many people is that exactly? Well, it's nearly twice the population of the entire western United States. That's 13 states, including . That is massive and incredibly rapid demographic growth, and it's accelerating. 

Immigration is now at the highest level ever recorded in American history. So is the number of foreign-born already living here. Over just the last year, roughly two million people from the Third World came across our . All of them arrived with the blessing of the White House. It makes you wonder what sort of economy  imagines we're going to have going forward. Domestic manufacturing is in steep decline, automation is replacing many of the low-skilled jobs that still remain. So what are these millions of new people going to be doing for work 20 years from now? They can't all be  housekeepers. They can't all bus tables at the French Laundry in Napa. And not all of them will, thank God. In spite of the  best efforts to import a permanent serf class to serve its donors, some of these immigrants will rise higher than Nancy Pelosi expects they will. Some will fight their way to the top of our society with the usual combination of inborn talent and grit, and honestly, bless them for that. No one invited them here. We didn't want them to come, but we will be sincerely glad when they succeed. 

And yet a country is more than the success of a handful of people, inspiring as that always is to watch. Sheer numbers matter, too. Even if every single person who snuck across our southern border this year goes on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, it would still be worth worrying about the effects that  have on our total population numbers. So the question is, how many people is too many? 

In Washington, you will never hear that question. More bodies in a country mean more power for the people who run it. Big nations need big governments. Politicians always want more people to rule, so the incentive for unrestrained population growth is baked right into the system. 

That's bad news for the rest of us. First, and most obviously, big governments don't treat their citizens very well. Yes, that's a Reagan-era talking point. It's also true. The larger a bureaucracy becomes, the more impersonal it gets. Past a certain size, organizations of any kind lose their regard for people. As they get bigger, they get blunter, more soulless and cruel. The people in charge no longer care what you think. They don't have to worry about how their policies will affect you or your family. And that's the inevitable product of population growth. If you had five children, you would bathe them all in love and attention. If you had five thousand children, you wouldn't know their names. 

So, in case you're wondering why our leaders no longer seem especially interested in your health or happiness or prosperity, that's the reason. They don't have to be interested. Our population is too big. Why should your opinion matter? You're one of many. Previous generations of Americans didn't live in a country like this, and they would be stunned by the attitudes that are so common now – attitudes we take for granted. Arresting people for walking through the U.S. Capitol building? ""How is that a crime?"" 19th century Americans would wonder. For most of our history, Americans believed they owned the Capitol. They thought it was theirs because they assumed this was their country. Political leaders told them that it was. After the 1904 presidential election, Teddy Roosevelt greeted voters in person on the lawn of the White House. It was his home. He lived there, but it belonged to them. 

Attitudes like that are long gone. They're the victim of population growth. The Athenians invented democratic government, but at its peak, Athens only had about 8,000 voters. So past a certain scale, democracy can't function very well. The concept of the citizen becomes too abstract. You see it in the way our leaders talk. Politicians barely mention individuals anymore. Instead, they yammer on about voting blocks, which are now called ""communities"": The immigrant community. The trans community. The Latino community. The Black community. You hear these terms constantly, but they are nonsensical. They don't mean anything. For example, there are about 47 million Black people in the United States. That's a community? No, it's not. By definition, 47 million people cannot be a community, no matter what color the people within it are. How could it be a community? They don't even know each other? What you're looking at is not a community, but 47 million individuals, each created by God as unique, each with opinions and interests and preference and goals that aren't quite the same as anybody else's. In other words, they're human beings. People who run big countries tend to forget that. 

When you're in charge of hundreds of millions of people, you cannot help but to dehumanize them. Not that our leaders have ever had a problem with dehumanizing people. In fact, they're strongly for it. A year and a half ago, some idiot kid from Harvard wrote a book demanding that the United States open its borders to an additional 700 million new immigrants from around the world. If we did that, he argued in the book, we'd have a population of a billion people and that might raise our GDP. Wall Street would be thrilled. Also, of course, would be more diverse with more interesting restaurants. Want Sierra Leonean goat barbecue delivered to your pod at 3 a.m.? With the billion people living here, you could get that done. 

As noted, the kid's a moron. But in Washington, here's the interesting part. No one laughed at him. Quite a few ostensibly smart people agreed with his thesis, including some prominent  who turned out to be as dumb and reckless as he is. Apparently, none of them has ever spent time in a crowded country. Anyone who has, knows how deranged it is to want a billion people here in the United States. Mass population growth makes life worse for pretty much everybody. That's the main problem with crowded countries. They're hard to live in. They're loud and dirty and chaotic. There is no privacy. There is no open space. There are never enough resources to go around, so the culture tends to become hyper-competitive and clannish. 

Crowding is bad for people. It's anti-human. In a famous series of experiments in the late 1940s, a researcher called John Calhoun forced a group of Norway rats to live in highly overcrowded pens, and almost immediately the rats changed. They became aggressive. Then they became psychotic. Ultimately, they died. People aren't so different from that. They need room. That's why our ancestors came to America in the first place because there was room here. You know who still understands this? Rich people understand this. Ask anyone who's been around the world and knows what the options are. Ask, ""If you left the United States. Where would you move?"" And no one's going to tell you Lagos or Mexico City or even Singapore. If they're being honest, they'll tell you New Zealand or Alpine Switzerland. Those are low-density places. They don't have a lot of other people in them. Why do billionaires buy huge boats? Same reason the ocean isn't crowded. There's no one else there. Uncrowded is good. Yellowstone is beautiful because it's empty. You don't have to be rich to understand this. It's all pretty obvious, really. Only in a moment like this, when the people with the loudest megaphone speaking exclusively in lies, would we need to be reminded of it. 

Bigger is not always better, in fact, most of the time it is worse. Have you driven around your country recently? You may have noticed there are fewer and fewer beautiful things in America. You're not imagining that. It's real. Dollar Stores are everywhere. The question is why is this happening? Well, the people in charge have no taste. That's part of it. They acquire, but they can't discern. For some reason, we put private equity firms in charge of the nation's esthetics. Accountants are doing our exterior design. That's a terrible idea, obviously, but it's not the core problem. The core problem is that bigness is inherently ugly. There's never been a beautiful skyscraper. Every single one of them is an atrocity. The fact that people still pretend otherwise tells you how conditioned we have become to disregard our own nature and our own natural longings. 

Would you rather wake up in a $30 million condo in the top floor of an office tower, or in a log cabin in a pine forest woodstove glowing as the snow falls? That's a rhetorical question. Obviously, no sane person would choose the condo. And yet we're told the condo is better. That's why it costs more because the building is bigger. But how exactly does it scale in advantage? How is that appealing? It's not. In fact, its scale is the problem. Massive size is a threat, no matter what it is, always. In our bones, we understand this. Anything huge is inherently terrifying to us. Children run from big things. 

If there's an upside to the last two years of the COVID insanity and there may be, it's that many Americans seem to be remembering what they long for. Look where they're moving. Almost always, it's to someplace smaller: L.A. to Austin, New York to Burlington, Seattle to Boise, Chicago to Naples. So it's the reverse of any other internal migration we've ever seen. 

Americans are moving from the cities to the farms, or at least to the outer suburbs. They want more nature, more human contact, more trees, more quiet, and it's hard to believe they'll ever stop wanting these things. Because they're natural. They're the things we all want. At some point down the road, you can imagine young people setting out for the all but abandoned interior of our continent. Some of them may figure out that a depopulated Finnish settler town on the banks of Lake Superior may be a better place to live and raise children than some sterile commuter parking lot 20 miles from a crumbling metroplex. They could figure that out. People aren't that stupid. They've just been misled. 

Economic forces are going to drive this, by the way, as they always do. For decades, our leaders have ignored the essentials – our food, our energy, our water – in favor of boutique nonsense that improves nobody's life. Pregnant flight suits, ladies and gentlemen. These people are ridiculous, and we're about to see the results of their long-standing negligence. , for example, probably aren't going down. How high are they going to go? Nobody knows. But at some point, it will become very obvious that it makes more sense to buy your staples nearby than it does to order them online from a warehouse across the continent. So the rising cost of transportation is likely to be permanent. 

The world we live in, in other words, cannot last. And that's not necessarily a tragedy. There's nothing wrong with setting down roots somewhere that's smaller. It's not a bad thing to know the man at the grocery store or the ladies at the post office. It's pretty nice, actually. It might even be an improvement over Midtown, Manhattan, believe it or not. Healthy societies are not at all like the one we are living in now. They're not impersonal. They don't exist to maintain empires. They exist to serve the human beings who live within them. They elevate their citizens. They don't degrade them. Now, obviously, that's the opposite of the system we currently have. 

The good news is the system we currently have cannot last. It's too perverse. It's too disconnected from the natural world. So it will end. And as it does, and as we think about how we want to live going forward, it's worth remembering that other people, in the end, are all that matters. Your relationships are the sum of your life. Those relationships start with your family. They move outward in concentric circles. They include your friends, your neighbors and the people you work beside. This is your actual community. The human beings, you know personally, the ones you love, the ones you take responsibility for, and that can never be a very big group.

578	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-why-still-talking-about-january-6	2022-01-06 23:21:00	Tucker Carlson: Why are we still talking about this? | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host examines the left’s ‘repulsive’ rhetoric covering the events on Jan. 6 one year later.

As you may have heard, this is the anniversary of , and in commemoration of that, we have donned the official network-approved solemn anchor outfit: white shirt, muted tie, message reverence. But actually, if you take three steps back as historical events go—if we’re being honest now—January 6th, barely rates as a footnote, really, not a lot happened that day. If you think about it, the presidential election was not overturned, the Capitol was not destroyed. The government wasn't toppled. No matter what you may have heard, not a single elected official was injured, thank God. Police got shoved. Unfortunately, punches were thrown. But the only person who wound up dead from violence was an unarmed protester who was shot to death without warning by a cop. None of the so-called insurrectionists had guns. When was the last time you saw an insurrection like that?

So looking back, you could probably call what happened on January 6th a riot, we have called it that, but really only just a riot, maybe just barely. By recent standards, it was an embarrassingly tepid effort. No one even bothered to set a fire or spray paint slogans on the walls. So the question is why are we still talking about this? Why are our leaders obsessing over this event? For every single one of the last 365 days, the propaganda machine has been at 11, ginning up noise about January 6 to deafening levels, and it's not stopping. In fact, after all this time, amazingly, the yelling is getting louder and wilder and still more disconnected from reality. Why are they doing this? Well, it's not for voters. Look at the polls. Voters are not very interested in hearing about this anymore, and you can see why.

A year after the  it doesn't make sense. It's not relevant to their lives. Everyone agrees January 6 was ugly. But was it really a greater threat to America than, say, ? Than opening the southern border and admitting two million people whose identities we can't confirm? Yeah, they tell us January 6 was scary. Reporters were very afraid. But was it as scary as what's going on right now tonight in say, upscale shopping malls in Atlanta, where people are being shot to death in the parking lot? It was a crime, OK? Was it a greater crime in the manufactured  that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, mostly young people, in the last year? Probably not. And yet protesters who walked through the Capitol that day are still in jail tonight a year later. The Sackler family, the group that destroyed rural America with OxyContin, got off with a fine. They’re still billionaires and so on and so on. 

So it's a tough sell, telling normal people that this is a worldhistoric event. So why are they still saying that? There are reasons actually and we're going to do our best to explain what those reasons are and what actually happened? 

But first to today's reaction, we begin with , though never a master of subtlety, you will not be surprised that in her speech today, she bypassed the subtlety. In fact, Harris compared the events of January 6th to Pearl Harbor and then to 911. Did she really say that? You ask? Oh, yes, she did. 

Yeah. January 6th, it's one of those indelible moments, one of those moments you can't forget, like the birth of your first child, the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing, you've got to ask yourself, where were you when CNN claimed for the very first time that our democracy was under assault? Chances are you're probably standing at an airport waiting to get on the plane and wishing to God someone would turn the sound down on the TV set bolted to the ceiling. Because it's absurd, and so is what Harris said—it's ridiculous. In fact, it's so ridiculous, we're not even going to bother to deconstruct it once again or attempt to refute it. It's self-discrediting as if Kamala Harris could be further discredited. 

But not to be outdone in the Hyperbole Olympics, her boss slash subordinate pick one, , decided to up the historical stakes, assuming that's possible in a separate speech, which we're not going to show tonight because it was awful and weird. Biden told the country that in fact, symbolically, January 6th was worse than the Civil War, the American Civil War. That would be the war that killed more than a million people. January 6th was worse than that because somebody held a naughty flag. It's so far beyond parody at this point, it's hard to know how to assess it. Where did this come from? Obviously, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't write their own material. Neither one is capable of composing more than a bitchy text message with emojis. But some human beings sat down and typed those words and then read them on the screen. A speechwriter. And you wonder if that speechwriter felt shame as he did that. 9/11? Pearl Harbor? The Civil War? Your face will go red even thinking something like that. 

But these people have no shame. And that definitely goes to the national media, they were out in force today. So in case you're still wondering, after all these years if there is such a thing as a coordinated message campaign where someone gets on a call and says, here's what we're saying today for political effect, in case that's even a question in your mind, we sat down with a pen today and counted as at least eight separate television anchors described January 6th as quote, ""One of the darkest days in our history."" Exact same words. Now it's not simply that they all love cliches because they're dumb, though. Of course, that's true. It's the all said it together, as they always do, and this was on three separate TV networks that was there were more than three, but we finally felt sick and gave up watching. But it was MSNBC, as usual, that went all the way for the prize and grotesquery today. The Joy Reid network found a guy called Doug Brinkley—he's one of those television historians who's never actually written significant history of anything—to just come right out and compare January 6th to Auschwitz. You knew that was coming. Now, this is repulsive. But as historians, we feel dutybound to show you what actually happened. Here is Doug Brinkley. 

We're in a kind of civil war. But more specifically, we await the ADL's furious statement condemning Doug Brinkley for trivializing genocide, which he just did. We'll let you know when we get that statement. In the meantime, Doug Brinkley was right about one thing. There are an awful lot of images showing what happened inside the Capitol on January 6th. We don't have to guess for the most part. I want to show one of them tonight because it's frankly representative. Here's the terrifying scene on the floor of the United States Senate as insurrectionists swept in.

So the guy with the flag at the back of the shot, that’s the QAnon Shaman, he's doing years in prison for that and only that. But the most interesting line in that entire clip, which is you may have seen we got from the New Yorker, hardly a rightwing source, is what the armed police officer says in that exchange to the dangerous QAnon Shaman, who's still rotting in prison. Quote, ""Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?"" Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing—not even leave the building, just the Senate wing. Can you hear the terror in that officer's voice? 

There is also film of what you saw if you were watching the coverage live that day. If you're watching January 6th unfold in real-time and you were probably like most people, no matter who you voted for, kind of shocked by it. Really, people swarming around the Capitol? That's not good. But then you saw something pretty strange, you saw the police who were in charge of securing the perimeter, move aside the barricades and let the protesters or rioters or insurrectionists whatever you’re going to call them—a lot of people still in prison—let them in the building. So why did they do that?

Now we know conclusively, because an awful lot has been reported on it, much divulged by the U.S. government, that law enforcement authorities knew there was going to be a significant protest that day. And so they were prepared. Apparently they had snipers with shoot-to-kill orders on standby. So why exactly where the protesters allowed in, welcomed in, by law enforcement? There may be a completely good reason for that. We're not doubting that there is an honest explanation. We just don't know what it is. No one has ever explained that. Liz Cheney, who has berated the country in the most self-righteous possible way for weeks, months now, telling us we need to get the bottom of exactly what happened—totally uninterested in finding out why that happened. Which everyone who was watching TV saw. And there are other questions that just don't make sense. These are not conspiracy theories, these are sincere questions based on actual footage, we brought this up a couple of times. 

There's a man called Ray Epps, who was a longtime conservative activist. He was captured on camera at least three times, possibly more encouraging people on January 6th and the day before—January 6th Eve, January 5th—encouraging protesters to storm the Capitol.

So that's Ray Epps, again, we show that to you before Congressman Thomas Massie asked the attorney general, What's that about? Is this guy going to be charged? Where is he? He was on the  mostwanted list. Now he's not. Attorney general refused to answer the question. No one has answered the question again, there's not a conspiracy theory. It's a legitimate question. Why won't they answer it and what's the answer? 

And then there's this there are a number of people like this which could give you one other example. Now this man has been dubbed by internet sleuths as the scaffold commander. Now he was shot from a variety of different angles on videotape on January 6th, appearing to give orders to the crowd from an elevated position. There's really no doubt if you watch the tapes and they're all available online and if interested, you should that this guy was coordinating the movement of the crowd toward and into the United States Capitol. Now he's caught directly on camera. There's facial recognition software out there, probably not too hard to find out who this guy is. If FBI agents can fly to  and hassle old ladies on Social Security because they were present, they can probably find this guy. And yet, as far as we know, this guy who clearly had some kind of management role that day has not been arrested, has not been charged or even publicly identified. What is that about? 

So there he is, scaffold commander, commanding the crowd to break the law, exhorting them forward to break the law. There was the largest manhunt in American history conducted after this day, January 6th. We're still talking about it, as noted a year later. And yet this guy is not only unidentified, no new authority seems interested in the slightest and finding out who he is and why is that?

In the weeks before  took office a little over a year ago, federal officials met to decide how they were going to distribute the new COVID vaccines. If you'll think back, you'll remember that December of 2020 was the deadliest month to date in the  pandemic. More than 65,000 Americans had died that month. People are very afraid of the virus. Then there was no treatment protocol for it. Vaccines seemed like the only hope. So the meeting was very significant. 

The CDC’s chief medical officer, a person called Kathleen Dooling, unveiled her plan to distribute the vaccines nationally. She began by acknowledging that older Americans indeed face the greatest risk, as everyone understood. So logically, if you wanted to save as many Americans as possible from dying, you would give preference the very first shots to people over 65. That's the obvious policy. It might be the only morally defensible policy. 

But there was a problem with doing that, she explained. Older Americans were too White, as Dooling put it, ""Racial and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among adults age 65 and older."" And this meant, according to Dooling, they could not be allowed to get the first COVID shots, whether they needed them or not. 

So instead, Dooling recommended giving priority to a group the government started calling essential workers. Their main qualification was not that they were essential, but they were less White than old people. 

So that's what the CDC went with. Its panel overwhelmingly approved Kathleen Dooling's recommendation. None of this got a lot of notice at the time, but it was a major change. Never in American history, modern history in any case, has the federal government made it official policy to withhold lifesaving medical treatment from Americans on the basis of their skin color. But that's exactly what the CDC did. 

Those most likely to die of COVID had to wait weeks until their vaccines were approved. How many of them died in the meantime as they waited? No one kept track of those numbers because nobody seemed to care. And because nobody cared, the trend continued. Race had become a deciding factor in the distribution of critical health care in this country. Several states made it explicit. Whites would go last in the COVID vaccine queue regardless of need. The state of Vermont did this, so did the state of Montana. And then the moment he was declared President-elect Joe Biden made it official. A concept called equity, a kind of hyper-aggressive, racially hostile affirmative action would form the basis of everything the new administration did, beginning with COVID policy. 

Here's Biden before even being sworn in last year:

So you'll notice the assumption in that sentence which undergirds all the assumptions behind the administration's equity policy, and that is that non-White means poor and non-White means less healthy. 

As a factual matter, that's certainly not true across the board. It's not even close to true. In fact, the highest income groups in this country are not White, but they've run with it. And he made good on that promise. In its first year, the Biden administration awarded billions of dollars in COVID relief, for example, to Black farmers purely on the basis of their skin color. Race was the only criterion. Now doing that was illegal, obviously. It violated all kinds of federal laws, and a federal court soon struck it down. But the White House didn't stop the accelerated, and they applied that same standard to everything, very much including the allocation of health care. 

Health care for all? That was the slogan for generations. The new slogan under the Biden administration was health care for favored groups. And those policies continue tonight. They're illegal, they're immoral. And yet they are all but ignored by the media and, by the way, by Republican lawmakers. 

Several weeks ago, for example, the Food and Drug Administration released a fact sheet on a monoclonal antibody called sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is, at this point, the only monoclonal antibody treatment that has proven effective against the latest variant of the coronavirus. The FDA provided guidance for physicians in all 50 states, telling them how to determine which patients should get this critical treatment. Physicians, the FDA explained, should consider quote race and ethnicity as they administer treatments, and so physicians are doing that across the country. 

In , COVID patients are triaged by a scoring system that determines whether they qualify for these potentially life-saving antibody treatments. If you look at the scoring system, you’ll notice that race often counts more than physical health. The state of Utah, for example, gives two points to anyone simply for not being White. You win if you're not White. If you have congestive heart failure at the same time, you get one point. So if you're a White, congestive heart failure patient, that's not enough for you. 

It's the same story in . Minnesota awards to point to so-called BIPOC patients. That means anyone who's not White. If you have high blood pressure and you're 60 years old, you get one point. So tough luck for you. Imagine if that was one of your parents. It is one of someone's parents. 

In New York, writes Aaron Sibarium in a shocking new piece for the Washington Free Beacon, ""Racial minorities are automatically eligible for scarce COVID-19 therapeutics, regardless of age or underlying conditions."" It doesn't matter what kind of health they're in. All that matters is their skin color. Whites don't qualify. 

This is not health care, it's punishment, it's punishment meted out on the basis of skin color. Now the justification for all of us, and the authorities could not be clearer about it, they've taken their ideas directly from America's colleges, they'll tell you why they're doing this, the justification is history. The United States has mistreated racial minorities in centuries past, they say. Therefore, Whites must suffer now. So your ancestors did bad things or people who looked like your ancestors did bad things. So now we're withholding medicine from you. They call this equity. It's not equity. It is collective punishment. It's the North Korean standard. It's the definition of evil. 

And in case you're wondering, that's actually what it is, consider this: A young Haitian man could cross our border illegally today. Many have. That person could show up at a clinic in New York tomorrow for COVID treatment and get preference over an elderly American citizen purely because of his appearance. Think about that. The Haitian has not suffered from systemic racism in America, whatever that is. He just got here. But he goes to the front of the line anyway. 

Now, that's not a criticism of the Haitian. It's not his fault. He didn't make the rules. But the Americans who did make the rules clearly didn't make them on the basis of public health. They made them in an effort to hurt a specific group of Americans. And they're succeeding. This is happening everywhere, even in places you would never expect it to happen. 

This man talked to an employee at a Texas medical facility to find out exactly what their policies are. 

So you can't get lifesaving drugs from the government of Texas if you're the wrong color. Think about that. 

We reached out to the  Department of Health about this back in November, and they denied allocating any health care on the basis of race, but of course they were lying. The North Central Texas COVID 19 Regional Infusion Center was created by the Texas Department of Health last year. The Infusion Center's website, which says it's statefunded, featured an information sheet that explicitly listed race as an eligibility factor for getting antibody therapy. That's what you just saw there - someone being denied medical treatment because he's the wrong color, without even assessing the relative health risks involved. The website, maintained by county of Tarrant County in Texas, explains that being non-White automatically makes you eligible for treatment. 

So this is still happening on a wide scale. The question is: Why are Americans putting up with this? It's immoral. We're used to hearing that your kids kick into a certain school if they're the wrong color or get a certain job if they don't have the right appearance, and apparently have accepted that. The only sin is complaining about it, that makes you a monster. 

But denying health care to American citizens because of their race? That is too much. Actually, it's terrifying.

580	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-georgia-voting-rights	2022-01-12 01:31:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden's speeches reveal what he thinks of Americans | Fox News	"The ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host exposes Biden’s condescending treatment of Americans in his opening monologue.

Time for civics class, the abbreviated version. Here's how democracies work: In a democracy, voters strike a highly straightforward deal with a government that rules them. Here's what it is:  do their best to improve your life. In exchange for that, you vote for them. That is a voluntary arrangement. It works pretty well. For 250 years, that's how it's worked here in the United States. 

But suddenly, not anymore. During his entire first year in office,  did virtually nothing to improve the actual lives of actual American citizens. And he didn't because he didn't even really try. Making voters happy is not a feature of the equity agenda. Punishment is the point of the equity agenda, inflicting pain on the right people, dispensing rough justice, meting out reparations by other names. 

In his speeches, you can see clearly how Joe Biden feels about America. He's deeply disappointed in the country, and he's annoyed with the people who live here. Biden doesn't cajole voters. He harangues and berates them. He patronizes them and issues threats. You cause the corona pandemic. You're stupid and selfish. No Fourth of July hot dogs until you obey. 

So for an American president, this is an entirely new way of governing. And you've got to wonder how long it can continue. How exactly are Democrats going to hold on to power in the coming midterm elections? If you think about it, there's only one way they can do that. They've got to create a new form of government, one that keeps incumbents in power forever, no matter what they do, no matter how incompetent and destructive they may be. 

One way to do that is by diluting the political power of citizens. And that's why Democrats in  are allowing nearly a million foreign nationals here illegally to vote in local elections. It's why Gavin Newsom has announced that California is now going to offer unlimited health care to illegal aliens, so that more of them will come. That's the point. And it's why Democrats are pushing for what they describe as a transformative voting rights bill. It's their top legislative priority. It’s the main thing they care about.

Joe Biden had a speech about it this afternoon in . The event didn't start well, as he has before, Biden referred to his running mate as the president of the United States. If only. 

Then, as he almost always does during public appearances these days, Joe Biden got angry. 

So what is this, John Lewis Civil Rights Act that grouchy old Joe Biden is tired of being quiet about? Well, at its heart, the bill would give the federal government the power to control how elections are conducted across the country. The bill requires states to obtain pre-clearance from the federal government before they can set the rules of their own elections. 

What does this mean? Well, it means, among other things, that states would no longer have the authority to require voter ID or registration at the polls. States would also lose the power to pick the locations for polling sites, as well as the ability to draw the boundaries of their own congressional districts. Oh, that's what it's about. 

Before doing virtually anything related to democracy, states would have to follow a formula written by  that, needless to say, focuses mainly on race. Why? Well, the idea is simple. The idea is this country is too racist to allow states to run their own affairs.  has to run them. Only she is not racist enough to conduct elections. 

Everything about that claim is absurd. If America is so racist, then why have tens of thousands of Haitians stuck across our border this year? Nice to hear someone answer that question or even ask it, but the idea itself is totally unconstitutional. We know this because the Supreme Court was pretty clear about it almost 10 years ago, back in 2013. This is not allowed. It's never been allowed. And in fact, known sane population would ever allow it. Not voluntarily, anyway. 

Why would you let incumbent politicians rig the game in their own favor? We would not allow that. You'd have to be bullied into it. How would you be bullied? You know the answer. The fastest way to bully Americans, other than by scaring them with viruses, is to call them racist. So, of course, that's precisely what the Democratic Party is doing right now. They're telling us the civil rights movement never happened. Is still 1951 in Birmingham, and you, my friend, are Bull Connor. Shut up and obey racist. 

Joe Biden has never been very subtle, so today he just came out and said it.

Bull Connor? Everyone under 70 is thinking football player, who's that? But Jefferson Davis, really? So if you oppose an unconstitutional power grab by corrupt politicians in their 80s, you are the leader of a confederacy. You're a foreign combatant. That's what he said. That's how important it is to keep the Democratic Party in power forever, and that's why we need to change the way the Senate votes. So we'll never lose an election again. 

Here's Joe Biden today:

Yeah, getting rid of the filibuster. We can go on about this, heard it, you probably know, but it's worth remembering that the Democratic Party Joe Biden's party invoked the filibuster more than 300 times recently. Oh, not during the civil rights movement. That was in 2020. Apparently, they sided with Bull Connor every time. 

So what's different? Well, the threat of White terror, of course. Getting rid of voter ID laws is a matter of national security, Biden explained. Stand in the way and you may be a terrorist. Once again, the president:

Enemies within our own country, we will kill them. It's kind of amusing to see Joe Biden call other people extremists. The message: Give me total power over your life or else I know you're a dangerous radical. It's pretty funny, but it's also not funny. 

Just hours before Joe Biden spoke, the Department of Justice announced the formation of a new domestic terrorism unit. What's it for? Well, you can read about it on the website. It's designed to hunt down and punish anyone who opposes the federal government or is otherwise ""anti-authority."" Anti-authority? Who's that? Well, pretty much at this point, all thinking people who aren't directly on the federal payroll. That means you.

It means all of us got the message? If you think voters ought to show I.D. at the polls, you could be hearing from the FBI because you're a threat. On the other hand, speaking papers, you should know that your COVID papers are still mandatory, and becoming more so because vax cards are not at all like driver's licenses at polling places, they're not racist. Vax cards are holy and they're essential. 

In fact, in Washington, D.C., the mayor, Muriel Bowser, just announced you're no longer allowed outside without your papers. Here's the quote: ""Starting Saturday, we'll need these three things before heading out: Proof of vaccination (12 years), Proof of vaccination and photo I.D. (18 years), and a mask. Otherwise, you must stay in your house, because we own your body. That's Muriel Bowser, who, by the way, is not a dangerous extremist. She can't be, because she's loyal to the regime.

I’m not trying to be cruel this Wednesday, just reading the numbers:  is the most unpopular president that the United States has had in a very long time. Voters dislike  even more. And that's a problem because this is supposed to be the new administration's honeymoon period, the part where everyone thinks they're great. So it's not getting better from here. This is as beloved as the Biden administration is going to get. 

Smart  can read the numbers. They understand this, and they're working on a solution. This week, two of them wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal calling on the party to support for . Hillary is the best-positioned candidate to win a national election, they argued. She's also, they noted, younger than Joe Biden. Former President Bill Clinton agrees with this, or says he does anyway. Bill Clinton told People Magazine that his wife is, ""The most qualified person to run for office in my lifetime, including me."" 

In fact, failing to elect Hillary in 2016 was in Bill Clinton's studied estimation, a historic national tragedy: ""One of the most profound mistakes we've ever made."" Unforgivable, really. The good news is we now have a chance to correct that mistake, and you don't get those very often in life. 

Typically, when you do something rash or stupid, you've got to live with the consequences. It's probably happened to you. One night you're listening to Born to Run after too many drinks. The next thing you know, you've got Bruce Springsteen's face tattooed on your lower back. It's embarrassing. It's also permanent. Think of Hillary Clinton as America's National Tattoo Remover. She alone can erase the stain of our youthful, bad judgment. God bless that woman. 

But wait a second, you say, Hillary can't win, she's yesterday's candidate. This country's got a short attention span. We want the new, new thing, and Hillary Clinton isn't new. She's been around forever. We're bored of her. Well, if you believe that you don't remember Hillary Clinton very well. Call her what you will, but she's not boring. Hillary is like a box of Cracker Jacks, or you're emotionally volatile niece who goes to art school. She's full of surprises. You never know what you're going to get. There are days when Hillary seems like a sensible Midwestern Methodist who grew up Republican in a suburb outside Chicago. That's the biographically, accurate Hillary Clinton. But it's hardly the only Hillary Clinton. During the years she spent in Arkansas, for example, Hillary often played the loyal daughter of the American South, a southern fried Dixie lady with a spunky feminist twist that was the character she was portraying when we first met her 30 years ago, this month. It was during the 1992 presidential primaries. If you watch the clip, she even has an accent.

BILL CLINTON: ho  

HILLARY CLINTON: 

You don't hear a hint of Park Ridge, , in her voice. It's all bourbon and okra. Pretty impressive. But that's hardly the only persona in Hillary's quiver. She contains multitudes. When she feels like it, Hillary can transform herself entirely from a middle-aged rich White lady to a weary, but dignified household domestic turned civil rights protester, bruised and battered from a harrowing march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the road to . Sometimes Hillary Clinton is just sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

HILLARY CLINTON: 

It’s not a bad impression. Of course, there are other days when Hillary doesn't talk at all, that's in her repertoire, too. She just points her finger at you and cackles wildly like a mental patient on the subway. For the uninitiated, it can be a disconcerting experience; is she casting a spell? Is she going to bite me? You're never sure. But her staff isn't worried. They think it's all part of her secret sauce. It's one of the reasons everyone loves Hillary. Here's the cackle routine. 

PBS:  

HILLARY CLINTON: (Laughs)

CNN:  

HILLARY CLINTON: (Laughs)

REPORTER:  

HILLARY CLINTON: (Laughs)

COMEDY CENTRAL: 

CNN: 

HILLARY CLINTON:  

No, she didn't kill . Remember all that? You're starting to see how the Hillary Clinton phenomenon began in the first place and why it could so easily rekindle. Hillary's political career was always a grassroots movement, a prairie fire if you will. She had famously broad support from top DNC officials to several billionaire Democratic donors. Ron Burkle came out for Hillary. That's like winning every voter in the state of Ohio, at least from a fundraising perspective. 

So clearly, she's got the mechanics down. How about the issues? What's Hillary going to run on? Come on. Think about it. Libya. She's going to run on what she did in the North African nation of Libya. It's the one achievement of her life that's uniquely hers. Her husband had nothing to do with it. As Secretary of State under Obama, Hillary Clinton ordered the killing of Moammar Gadhafi. He was the bloodthirsty Libyan strongman who was also, let's be honest, creepy and weird and therefore deserving of death. Hillary had him offed. Then she laughed about it. Watch. 

CBS: 

HILLARY CLINTON: 

CBS: 

HILLARY CLINTON: .

""We came, we saw, he died."" Pretty funny. But then what happened? Once Hillary killed the leader of the country, how did the country do? Well, let's see. We'll tell the story in pictures. Here's the capital of Libya before Hillary Clinton decided to introduce the Libyan people to a little thing we call human rights. The city looks fine. But underneath there was no freedom. There were too few Soros-backed NGOs. She changed that. Now in that same city post-Hillary,  people are being sold as property in the now thriving slave markets in downtown Tripoli. No, they're not very happy, that's true, but at least Gadhafi's gone. So on some level, they're free. They've been liberated by Hillary Clinton, despite the fact they're now enslaved. 

That's called progress. It's worth something. In fact, it's a pretty good campaign slogan. Hillary 2024: She'll do for us what she did for Libya. You could imagine the posters and T-shirts and coffee mugs. Somebody is going to need to get those slaves to sign a consent form, put them on the list. But all of a sudden, Hillary Clinton for president starting to sound a little less crazy, isn't it? In fact, it's starting to sound inevitable. 

There are really two questions left to answer: Why did Hillary lose last time? And who would she run against two years from now? Let's take the first question first. It's got the simplest, most obvious answer. Hillary Clinton was cheated out of her rightful destiny in 2016 because unseen forces of evil worked furiously to undermine her because they feared her strength and goodness. Come on, you knew that. Hillary Clinton certainly knows that. 

So the , WikiLeaks, Jim Comey, Facebook, Democratic Party, saboteurs and the citizenry of Macedonia, those are the people who did the funny business that was like Pearl Harbor that prevented Hillary from becoming president. That's who opposed her last time. Obviously. Who's going to oppose her this time? Well, for the answer to that question, we turn, as we always do to Mr. Tom Friedman of the , who was both the Pulitzer Prize winner and a certified moron. In that paradoxical way, that's familiar to Washingtonians, Tom Friedman is just dumb enough to get a lot of things right. If Tom Friedman thinks it, chances are a lot of other self-important mediocrities think it, too. And those are the people who run this country. Yesterday, Tom Friedman wrote a piece calling on Joe Biden to replace Kamala Harris with  in the next election. Now, if you're not Tom Friedman or his friends, this might strike you as ridiculous. 

In fact, it might seem like yet another sign that our political class has reached peak decadence and exhaustion. If they're pushing a Cheney in the next presidential cycle, maybe they've run out of ideas. Well, of course they have. And that's exactly what gives Hillary such a natural opening here. As long as we're turning our politics into a 1990s sitcom reunion, why not get George W. Bush to run? It's not a crazy idea. He's got the time to do it. At this stage, Bush would much rather run with Hillary than against Hillary. They're personal friends. On most things, they agree vehemently. But having a Bush and a Clinton on the same ticket wouldn't work. It's just too obvious. Maybe W could be convinced to take one for the establishment and throw on the Republican jersey one last time. He's 75, but that is a full presidential term younger than Joe Biden, which by current standards qualifies as fresh, new leadership. George W. 2024: Time to give the younger generation a chance. It might work or not, just spit spitballing here. 

Either way, it is way past time to get Hillary back into the White House. The ladies got a speech to give. She wrote it five years ago for her inevitable inauguration. Thanks to the Macedonians, that didn't happen. But she never threw it away. She still got the speech. Last month, she read a portion of it on NBC News. 

Who's she crying for? Herself. In case you're confused by the context here, that was Hillary telling her deceased mother that everything is going to be OK because Hillary has been elected President of the United States. No more tears, no more anxiety, we're going to make it, we've got a woman in the White House. 

A lot's happened since Hillary Clinton wrote those words, it is a different country now than it was five years ago. But Hillary Clinton hasn't changed. Her primary interests remain exactly what they always were. She's still talking with endless and undimmed enthusiasm about herself. We don't know what's in the rest of her victory speech. We're going to have to wait until January of 2025 to find out. But one thing we can safely assume: it ends with a cackle and a finger.

There was a lot going on right around the time of the last presidential inauguration, so you may have missed that on his very first day as president,  ordered federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prepare a review of how the administration should fight . By last June, that report was complete. It concluded that after more than 20 years, Islamic terror is no longer the greatest threat to this country. Instead, the agency declared that domestic political extremism is ""the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today."" 

That's a very stark assessment, so you have to ask, who exactly are these terrorists who threaten us so urgently? And they're not what you might expect. The report did not even mention the BLM riots, the deadly BLM riots that had just taken place. There wasn't a word about Antifa. There was nothing about the gunmen who murdered 800 Americans in the city of Chicago last year, many of them children.

Instead, the Biden administration declared that the ""most lethal elements"" of today's domestic terror threat are political conservatives. There are people who disagree with Joe Biden. Now that report was released almost exactly six months ago. Six months ago this Friday. It received relatively little attention and hasn't since. And no major news organization even asked the most obvious question: These terrorists who threaten us, where are they? If  voters are really the most ""lethal threat"" our country faces today, where are all the people they've killed? 

That's not an easy question to answer. Just look at the numbers, which are fairly tightly kept. Take a look at all the Americans who died from violence over the past 12 months, and there are many thousands and thousands of Americans. Ask a simple question: How many of them were killed by right-wingers for political reasons? Not many. 

Or, since we're talking about threats here, pose the question another way. Are you more in danger walking through a neighborhood that votes 90 percent , or a neighborhood that votes 90 percent ? Come on. 

This claim is ridiculous on its face. There is no substantial right-wing terror threat in this country, certainly not in relative terms. There just isn't. And no one has shown there is. The White House knows this, of course, they can read the numbers as well as anyone else can. So they're working hard to create the illusion of that threat. Much hangs on their ability to do that. 

You may remember this story this fall about a group called the National School Boards Association, which sent a letter to the feds asking the DOJ to take a look at parents who don't like their kids’ curriculums. Well, the Justice Department responded immediately to the letter. Talk about customer service. 

Days later, the attorney general announced the FBI would investigate moms who dared to complain that school board meetings as potential terrorists. Many people were shocked by this story, but we just learned it's worse even than we thought it was. 

A new Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the National School Boards Association asked the feds to investigate parents because the feds asked them to ask the feds to investigate parents. See how that works? 

Apparently, the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, told school board administrators to write their letter to the White House. The White House then used that letter as a pretext to begin a crackdown on parents. See how that works? The snake eating its tail. 

When you don't have enough domestic terrorists to justify a political purge, then you just go ahead and create them, and that's exactly what they've been doing. This week, the campaign against this new American al Qaeda entered a new and very ominous phase, again little noticed by the national media. This Tuesday, two days ago, the DOJ announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit. What will it do? Well, it'll target ""anti-authority ideologues."" 

Anti-authority ideologues. Now, keep in mind, this country was founded by people who are anti-authority ideologues. That's why they created America and baked the idea of opposing authority so it doesn't get too big and take over your life into our founding documents. These ideas are central to the American idea. In fact, they are the American idea. But in this administration, they are now crimes. Here's Matt Olsen, the assistant attorney general, explaining: 

Who's a threat to the country? That guy is the threat to the country, and the people working for him, and those propping him up, and the people spreading the core lie here, which is that American citizens who distrust the government or don't like its policies are terrorists. 

Just today on , Jason Johnson, one of its contributors, described the entire Republican Party as a terrorist organization. So you can see where this is going. Again, and we're quoting now, this is the assistant attorney general, ""We have seen a growing threat from those who subscribe to anti-government and anti-authority ideologies."" 

Really, is that threat growing? Is it true? Let's see here. That threat is being used to justify the creation of this agency, but it's not rooted in reality. Twenty-seven years ago, back in 1995, you'll remember 168 people were murdered in the Oklahoma City bombing. Another 700 were injured. 

Now, the investigation into what happened that day involved nearly 30,000 interviews. Investigators gathered 7,000 pounds of evidence. We could go on. It was an enormous investigation. Attorney General Merrick Garland, by the way, was part of it at the time. 

Here's the point: Despite the size of that investigation, no one suggested or even hinted that we might need to create a new domestic terror division within the DOJ to handle the problem. No, the whole thing was handled by  field offices, as things like this had been for many decades. 

The FBI field offices did their jobs. The man accused of doing it got the death penalty, and you may have noticed it didn't happen again. 

And then Joe Biden became president and the number of so-called domestic terror investigations more than doubled. So the question is: What exactly are they investigating if there's no substantial death toll from these terrorists in our midst? What exactly are the feds looking into? 

Well, they’re taking a close look at crimes like the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a plot that helped her political fortunes considerably. What did it consist of? Well, that conspiracy turned out to have more FBI agents and informants involved than would-be kidnappers. The guy the feds said was running it turned out to be homeless. He was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop. His friends called him Captain Autism, and they called him that for a reason. He wasn't the ringleader of anything. He couldn't have been. The whole thing was ridiculous, but it stoked the storyline that was politically expedient, and so the media uncritically promoted it again and again as if it were real. 

The media's job, by the way, to remind you, is to push back against government statements to find out if they're actually true, because it turns out politicians may say things for political reasons. And it's the media's job to discern truth from spin. The media's job is not to act as spokesman for the people in power. And yet, that's what they're doing. Now, the DOJ, in case you haven't noticed, this incited the Jan. 6 protesters are the real terrorists. They're the insurrectionists you keep hearing about. And yet, weirdly, as of just two days ago, not one American citizen had actually been charged by the federal government with insurrection. They admitted that. 

Oops. They can't actually be insurrectionists if no one has committed insurrection. That's pretty embarrassing. Apparently, DOJ finally realized how embarrassing it was. So about 48 hours after the testimony you just saw, and more than a year after Jan. 6 today, the feds announced that they will charge someone with sedition, after all. Now, if you've got any questions about the timing of these charges or the merit of the sedition case, the DOJ just announced, the Biden administration would like to remind you to keep those questions to yourself. 

And just to make certain you do keep them to yourself or are unable to share them with anyone else, today, Joe Biden also announced a crackdown on the news media. As he put it, a crackdown on anyone who spreads ""disinformation"" and ""misinformation"" about his government. 

The misinformation that's on your shows. Yeah. Message received. It has to stop, Joe Biden says. 

So that means that  and media organizations have to do what he says, just like his vaccine mandate, found unconstitutional today, by the way. It'll still be enforced because big businesses rely on the government to exist. They take government money, they're regulated from the very top to the very bottom by the government. 

So it takes a lot to defy the president of the United States. If he tells you to do something, you'd better do it. What Joe Biden is telling media companies to do today is to censor their content so it doesn't contradict his decrees. 

Now, CNN has no problem with this. In fact, they made fun of what Joe Biden said today. They made fun of his call for censorship. Not because it's obviously unconstitutional, which it is, but because it wasn't quite fascist enough. One of those weird-looking media reporters over at CNN wrote this: ""I'm sure the Murdochs will get right on this now that this special appeal has been made!"" 

So they understand exactly what's going on here. Joe Biden is targeting Fox News for censorship. His call for censorship, by the way, comes after hundreds of doctors and scientists called on Spotify to adopt a misinformation policy that would shut down Joe Rogan's podcast. Rogan recovered from COVID without the vax, and they hate him for it. 

So it's not just the government, of course. It's people acting on behalf of the government calling for the same thing, which is censorship of political opinions. What you're seeing here is dangerous. There's no other way to describe it. Far more dangerous than domestic terror threat they've been bloviating about for the last three days. It contravenes the First Amendment. 

Under the First Amendment, the government cannot coordinate with private actors to censor free speech. Period. Supreme Court has made that very clear over centuries. And yet that's exactly what's happening. Joe Biden did it today. Care to complain about that? Probably not. You may have noticed what happens to people who complain too much. 

Roger Stone, for example, complained an awful lot about the government. He did it loudly, often, he did it for years, and the DOJ didn't like it. So in the end, they accused Roger Stone on the basis of zero evidence whatsoever of colluding with Russia. In the end, they charged him with lying to Congress, something that happens literally every day of the year. But in his case, they made it a felony, threatened to send him to prison for the rest of his life, and in the meantime, they sent a helicopter, a boat and armed paramilitaries to his home at dawn after coordinating the raid with CNN. Really, one of the darkest moments in civil liberties in recent history. We still have the tape. 

So they coordinate with CNN just to make sure it's all preserved on tape to send the message to everybody else for the encouragement of the others, as the French used to say. And then they send guys with automatic weapons to your house to shut you up, to destroy you. 

Now the people who ordered that raid should've been brought up on charges themselves, but they weren't. They were promoted. And now, thanks to Joe Biden, they have more power to harass their political enemies. Do you feel safer?

Thursday, we interviewed one of the people the Biden administration charged with sedition. The man's name is Thomas Caldwell. The Justice Department claims that Caldwell was inside the Capitol building on . Caldwell insists emphatically that he was not. At some point, a jury will decide who is lying about that. 

For now, the rest of us, though, are free to ponder. A bigger question: Is Thomas Caldwell a seditionist? Is he an enemy of this nation? On Jan. 6, was Thomas Caldwell trying to overthrow the U.S. government by force? That's a pretty hard case to make. 

Caldwell's indictment paints him as a dangerous militia leader who is planning a sort of D-Day invasion on the banks of the Potomac. The real Thomas Caldwell does not fit that description. Caldwell is a senior citizen who walks with a cane. He's a devout Christian. Try to picture Thomas Caldwell leading a bloodthirsty band of insurgents. You can't, because he didn't. 

Like every protester that day, Caldwell arrived at the event unarmed, and like the overwhelming majority, he committed no acts of violence. The Justice Department claims that Caldwell sought to overthrow the American system, but that is hard to believe. Caldwell, in fact, spent most of his life in honorable government service, including 20 years as a naval officer. He retired with 100 percent physical disability. 

In fact, if anyone seems like a thoroughly loyal American, it's Thomas Caldwell. There's no question he likes this country much more than Susan Rice does or Tony Blinken. So why is Thomas Caldwell facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison? Because,  tell us, Thomas Caldwell AND co-defendants almost toppled our democracy. They came closer than anyone since Robert E. Lee. That's what they've been telling us for the last year. 

It's absurd. Only the fact we have heard it so often prevents us from recognizing how absurd it is. Nothing that happened on Jan. 6 came remotely close to threatening our constitutional order or for preventing  from taking office. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying and should be forced to explain specifically how the mechanics of democracy were imperiled that day. But they never explained. They just yell louder and then they issue more indictments. For the record, because reality still matters, or should matter, this was the scene inside the Capitol on Jan. 6:

This must be peaceful, we have the right to peacefully assemble. Well, it turns out, no, we don't. The man who said that got more than four years behind bars. His crime: Walking into what we used to call non-ironically, the People's House. That was the QAnon Shaman. At his sentencing, he looked shocked. Most of the indicted Jan. 6 protesters have looked shocked. 

If this was an insurrection, they had no idea whatsoever that they were participating in it. Business Insider reported this afternoon that on Jan. 7 of last year, the day after, protesters called  office line in the Capitol looking for items they may have left inside the building. Law enforcement took down their numbers and later arrested them. 

Is that the behavior of people who believe they were trying to overthrow the U.S. government? Obviously, it's not. These are Americans who came to their capital city with their friends to complain loudly about what politicians were doing. They assume that was still allowed, but it's not allowed. Joe Biden has made that very clear.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Read the script. Where exactly is all this criminal White supremacy, this right-wing domestic terrorism that poses, ""the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland""? Where is it? Of course, it doesn't exist. Many thousands of Americans are killed each year by violence. They're murdered. But conservatives are not the ones who are murdering them. Look it up. It's a ludicrous lie. 

In fact, until yesterday, no one connected to Jan. 6 had been charged with a crime that even approached the seriousness of domestic terrorism. Democrats in Congress are starting to notice that and complain about it. So Merrick Garland caved to the political pressure and . Now you'd think news organizations might have a few questions about the timing of that. This being an election year in which the Democratic Party's fortunes are heading south at high speed. 

But they didn't ask questions. They just celebrated the arrests uncritically. Here's one particularly oily little Biden toadie over on CNN:

Many of the rioters were expecting war. Or really, were they? Then why didn't they bring guns to the war? The indictment doesn't explain that. In fact, it tells us that as Jan. 6 approached, these dangerous conspirators who were anticipating war agreed not to bring firearms into the District of Columbia. 

""You guys are going to carry?"" one of them texted the others on what they thought was protected chat. ""No,"" the other said. ""OK, we aren't either."" 

So here you have the people the Biden administration tells us tried to overthrow the U.S. government. And yet at the very same time, this very same group also voluntarily decides to comply with Dick's famously restrictive gun laws. Uh-huh. 

So if you live in D.C., you know that not everyone does that. Not even close. Washington, D.C., has an awful lot of shootings. None of them seem to interest Merrick Garland. Yet the so-called sedition is somehow decided to follow the law. Now they're facing life in prison. 

It's all too ridiculous to be real, but it is real. What's going on here? Thomas Caldwell gave us this assessment last night. 

Oh, we're here to overthrow the government, we're seditionists, planning an insurrection with violence, but we better follow D.C. gun laws or else we'll get in trouble. That's literally what they're telling you. It's contemptibly absurd. 

Another indicted seditionist is a woman called Jessica Watkins. Watkins entered the capital unarmed 40 minutes after the initial breach on Jan. 6. She did not commit violence. She didn't break anything or assault anyone. She didn't set a fire or spray-paint the walls. She's not from Antifa. In fact, according to her lawyer, Watkins spoke directly to Secret Service agents. She voluntarily provided her contact information, and then she turned herself in to local police when she learned there was an arrest warrant for her. 

And yet, Jessica Watkins is now officially a terrorist. She and many others. So the whole point of this exercise is to redefine any opposition to the  as domestic terrorism as they face defeat in the midterm elections, some Democrats are just saying that out loud. Here's MSNBC's Jason Johnson:

Oh, they're Sinn Féin, the PLO and Hamas. But they follow Do you see gun laws, because you can get in trouble if you don't. These people. 

A front for a terrorist movement. Do they really mean what they say? Who knows if they mean it, they're acting like it. And that's the problem. 

So how did the rest of us respond as the U.S. government redefines people who disagree with their political beliefs as terrorists? Well, there's really only one way, and it's a nonviolent way. It's the essential way. Refuse to play along. Don't pretend they're sincere. They're not sincere. Tell the truth. Call authoritarianism what it is. Preferably with a middle finger extended. 

That's what a man called Alex Bruesewitz did. Bruesewitz is a  political consultant. He dares to work for candidates who are running against members of the Jan. 6 committee. You don't want to do that. 

What happened? Well, just days ago, a senior counsel on that committee demanded an interview with Bruesewitz. Here's how he responded: ""I feel sorry for you that you have to deal with the likes of Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Adam Schiff and the rest of the committee members on a daily basis. I will pray for you."" 

In other words, up yours. Then Bruesewitz described in clear and honest terms exactly what the Democrats are so obviously doing. ""This select committee has run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of my fellow citizens. Now it is targeting me."" Which it absolutely is. Good for Alex Bruesewitz.

For  the past few months amounted to the greatest political disaster of his life. In his case that’s not a small place to be. This is a man with three failed presidential campaigns on his resume, but this year has been different. We don’t mean to overstate it, but you can pick your humiliating ashes and sackcloth world-historic defeat, Stalingrad, Corregidor, Gallipoli and that is pretty much where Joe Biden is right now politically. 

Polls show him losing astounding levels of support from virtually every group of Americans who voted for him just a year ago. That would include Hispanics, moderate Democrats, African-Americans, and by big double digits, independents. At this point the  is down to just two core constituencies: Anxious upper-income women with multiple college degrees and baron personal lives, and members of the national news media. And even that might be overstating Biden’s support given that there is such dramatic overlap between those two groups. Essentially they are the same people. Now, because it can always get worse, Biden appears to be losing even the media. This is an ominous development. It’s not an exaggeration to say that if this trend continues, it is the end of the Biden presidency. 

The  are the only reason Joe Biden is president and the first place. Biden didn’t campaign for the job, he didn’t hold rallies or give speeches or tell the public what he might do if elected. No, for nearly a year Joe Biden stayed home hiding in terror from infectious voters. Instead, he let news organizations make his case for him, which they did. The media hid Biden’s faults, they attacked and censored his critics. In general, they gave no hint at all that you might be electing a senile mannequin with a lifelong history of sleazy behavior. Voters had no clue, they didn’t know who Joe Biden actually was. And yet suddenly, news organizations have decided to tell them. It’s pretty amazing to watch it. 

A very tough week of setbacks, the country is frustrated, that is CNN’s assessment. If it sounds mild to you, you could consider the source. CNN criticizing a sitting Democratic president? That’s like the College of Cardinals attacking the pope. It’s a violation of ecclesiastical authority. You never see it. And when it happens it means something. MSNBC went even further than that. One of the contributors decided to tell the channels viewers something they had never heard before. Joe Biden is old. Really, really old. Possibly too old to govern a nation of 335 million people.

Wait a second. You are telling us that Joe Biden doesn’t ""seem to have his hand firmly on the wheel."" Really? You sure we're talking about the same president here. Wasn’t this the guy not so long ago was challenging strangers to push up contests at town halls. He single-handedly rescued Nelson Mandela from the hell of Robben Island. This is the man who faced down Corn Pop with a chain at a public swimming pool. Now you are saying that man, that chiseled monument to decisive masculinity may be losing his grip? 

Yep, that is exactly what they are saying. And they seem almost bashfully apologetic as they say it. They had no idea Joe Biden was a lumbering, desiccated husk. No idea at all. They never saw Biden call anyone a dog-faced pony soldier. They didn’t notice him sniffing anybody’s hair or staring blankly into the middle of the distance like a lobotomy patient. They never saw it. They are as shocked as you are. CNN’s resident Nobel Prize winner came to the awful conclusion that maybe Joe Biden isn’t doing an amazing job as president.

Joe Biden is never at the White House and he is right about that, but it’s possible CNN missed the larger point. Biden isn’t fleeing Washington because he’s upset about political defeats, Biden is being dragged into isolation by advisors who are terrified he will get . They want him out of the city as quickly as possible. They know exactly how well masks and vaccines work. They’re not betting on Dr. Fauci’s guidance. The point is CNN is running away from Joe Biden. Even Don Lemon can see where this is going, he may be stupid, but his animal instincts are fully intact. Don Lemon could recognize a sinking ship when he sees one and he’s decided to disembark as swiftly as he can. 

Make for the lifeboats - CNN anchors first. Maybe if people like Don Lemon repeatedly make disappointed noises about Je Biden, no one will remember how they sounded a year ago and hold them responsible for this disaster. But we will, we remember. We saved the tape. Don Lemon wept with joy over Joe Biden’s election like Jesus had just returned to make gym memberships free and forgive everybody student loans.

We don’t care if you voted for ""us,"" not Joe Biden, for ""us."" Meaning Joe Biden’s friends and coconspirators over at CNN. ""I really don’t care, I’m so happy."" That is the tape. There you have it. If this were a trial, that would be the pivotal evidence. The glove fits, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You cannot acquit. The media foisted this Biden calamity on the United States, they got him elected, then they lied and distracted the population as he and the marionette operators who controlled him wrecked a lot of this country. That happened and it’s too late now to deny responsibility. These people are fully implicated in what they did. Lots of them are. Not just Don Lemon. 

This member of Congress from Silicon Valley, one of the smarter members, decided that actually, maybe Big Tech shouldn’t have censored legitimate stories, truthful stories, about Hunter Biden’s laptop after all. Maybe that was a mistake.

Oh. You are not for censorship? Thanks for that, congressman. But where were you when it mattered? Say, last October right before the election when people were trying to figure out who to vote for. You were staying dead silent like the rest of them. You were letting it happen. You were allowing democracy to corrode and die because of the time he thought it was worth it.  was just too scary. Trump was an emergency so we had to suspend the constitution to make this into an unfree country. We had no choice. 

But now that Biden is in office some of these people are having second thoughts. But why now? What is going on here and why is everyone suddenly saying the same thing at once. We can answer the second part of that question with absolute certainty. Everyone in the Democratic Party sounds exactly alike because messaged discipline is what they do, it’s who they are. No one in the party thinks independently. That is not allowed. Everybody in the group must say the very same thing in concert with everybody else in the group all the time. Period. It's like a North Korean singing troop. Deviations are punished. Think for yourself, even for a second, and you are denounced as a conspiracy theorist who thinks horse dewormer is medicine. We could give you a million examples of this. Our producer, Tom Fox, the genius who finds our tape every night the show often since he is the most repetitive job in television because everybody on every channel sounds exactly the same all the time. 

All these very same people are simultaneously trashing the president they got elected and have defended through everything for a year. Why? We are not alleging a potential conspiracy here. We don't take horse dewormers. We’re not saying there was a secret conference call between Jeff Zucker and Joy Reid and the staff of The Atlantic magazine. Who would even want to endorse something like that? More likely it’s a conspiracy of instinct. For all the talk you hear of diversity, there is precisely zero diversity in our national media. People may have different skin tones or different sexual interests, but it’s not relevant. They are all from such backgrounds with such similar beliefs and values and life experiences that their gut reactions to everything have aligned into perfect synchronicity. Like menstruating teenagers at summer camp, they speak as one, because on the deepest level they’re indistinguishable from each other. 

Still you wonder: There’s got to be some political point to all this? No one at CNN has going to undermine the long-term prospects of the Democratic Party, at least not intentionally. If they snatch the walker from Joe Biden’s hands, and that is exactly what they’re doing, who did they think is going to take over when he falls?

585	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-homeless-society-collapsing	2022-01-18 23:38:00	Tucker Carlson: The homeless crisis is a symptom of our society collapsing in real time | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host examines how leaders are rewarding criminal behavior in cities across the country.

We want to begin by noting something obvious. If you live in the United States, you may have noticed that many of our public spaces have become permanent homeless encampments. You see trash-filled tents blotting out what were once green and tidy public parks. You step over vagrants drooling, unconscious on the steps of train stations on the way to work. You watch as junkies  without any embarrassment at all, and then yell at pedestrians on the sidewalk, maybe at your children. 

At every intersection, there are beggars. It's what we used to imagine India was like, but this is not Calcutta. This is New York and San Francisco and Austin, Texas. So the question is what happened? And the short answer is: Our leaders did this. No matter what they tell you, homelessness is not an act of God. It's not the result of economic collapse in this country. America does not run out of housing. 

Instead, a determined group of well-funded ideologues decided to make it easier to live on the streets in this country while doing drugs. Therefore, many more people now live on the streets while doing drugs. See? Not complicated. 

In 2005, an unemployed alcoholic called Basil Humphrey enrolled in a rehab program in . When Humphrey refused to stop drinking, the rescue mission kicked him out. Those were the rules, and he spent months sleeping outside, as so many do. Eventually, local authorities ticketed him for camping on public property. That was the law. 

The story would have ended there, except that a huge corporate law firm in  called Latham & Watkins took an interest in the case on the other side of the country. Now, typically, Latham & Watkins represent Wall Street banks and prominent  officeholders. But the firm wanted to change vagrancy laws to increase homelessness. Why did they want that? We don't know. But the firm filed a lawsuit on Basil Humphrey's behalf against the city of Boise. 

That suit made it to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2018, the court declared that cities have no right to criminalize homelessness. In fact, the court ruled, cities have an obligation to provide free housing to the homeless at public expense. The  later upheld that ruling. 

The case was known as Martin vs. Boise, and it had exactly the effect that Latham & Watkins intended. City officials across the country no longer had an obligation to protect the public and public spaces from drug addicts who decided to live in them. 

At the same time, politicians suddenly had access to a massive new source of cash. Taxpayer money, many billions in taxpayer money, for something called homelessness prevention. Now, what is homelessness prevention? Well, of course, it's the opposite of what they call it, as always.

Here's  interpretation of homelessness prevention: 

Oh, stunning views of the Space Needle and Puget Sound. Do you have one of those? Well, crack heads do. More than half a million dollars per apartment to house drug addicts at public expense, at market rates. So you can see why real estate developers would strongly support a program like that. And of course, they strongly do. 

But luxury apartments are just the beginning. Seattle's most recent municipal budget allocated more than $150 million to other so-called homelessness programs just this year. Now, keep in mind, Seattle has fewer than 750,000 people living there, so that's an awful lot of money per bum. It's certainly a lot more than anyone else is getting in Seattle. 

At the same time, it was giving overpriced condos to drug addicts with stunning views of Puget Sound, Seattle allocated just $10 million total for its Small Business Stabilization Fund, designed to keep family businesses from going bankrupt during the COVID lockdowns. 

So the city's priorities could not be clearer than that. You lavished money on the least productive, most antisocial parasites in our society, and then you punish Americans who work for a living. Got it? And it's hardly just Seattle. 

The latest city budget in  proposes spending $667 million dollars on something called the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. And yet, at the very same time, San Francisco's Department of Children, Youth and Families gets less than half that amount. A city program designed to help lowincome families pay college tuition gets just $16 million total. That's about 2 percent of what the homeless get. 

So in San Francisco, it makes sense, in fact, it pays to get high on the sidewalk. Don't bother to get an education, nobody cares. That's the message from the city. Couldn't be clearer. 

In Austin, Texas, the city's budget for homelessness assistance was $68 million last year. At the very same time, the city of Austin spent just $3.5 million dollars in new loans for struggling small businesses, and only $7 million for ""mission-critical infrastructure and deferred maintenance at city facilities."" Like the things that matter. And at the same time as this was going on, the police department, the city of Austin got an $11 million budget cut. 

So what happened to the homelessness in Austin? The problem they were trying to solve? Well, to no one's surprise, it has grown by 10 percent in just two years. You get what you pay for. When you pay for homelessness, you get a lot more of it. See how that works? 

In Los Angeles, politicians have spent billions ""fighting homelessness."" This has been accompanied, of course, by a massive increase in the number of people who are homeless. Four years ago, the city spent $440 million on what it called solutions to homelessness. That was supposed to fix the problem. Did it? Homelessness in Los Angeles jumped 15 percent just last year. So this year, L.A. will spend more — close to a billion dollars on the homeless in 2022. 

As for the small businesses crushed by the city's lunatic COVID restrictions, you ask what will they get? Well, they get $62 million total. The city's gang reduction program gets about half that. 

So politicians in Los Angeles are, at the very least, very clear about their priorities. What has this done to L.A.? We don't have to look far to see the answer to that. Last week, a homeless man walked into a furniture store in the west side of Los Angeles and murdered a graduate student who was working alone there. He stabbed her to death for no apparent reason and then walked out. He's still at large. She was 24. Now she's dead. 

Today, her father told ""Fox & Friends"" that he holds city officials responsible for the killing. 

Pretty composed for a man who just lost his child, but he's absolutely right. Focusing our attention and our money on people who contribute nothing, who only detract from the project that is this country, don't help their communities or anybody's community, who hurt other people, who live solely for themselves, who are a danger to the rest of us, that's insane. And so that girl died, and she wasn't the only one. 

Last month in , a man called Kerry Bell murdered a 70-year-old emergency room nurse. She was on her way to work. One of the people we should be celebrating now, she's dead. Who's the man who killed her? Well, Bell had a long criminal record, you know, prior arrest in L.A. he had arrests in other states as well. But authorities let him go and kept letting him go. Bell was homeless. He was a victim. He was part of a protected class. And then he killed somebody. 

She was an emergency room nurse walking alone to work, and now she's dead. Another woman murdered by the homeless. And don't lie to yourself, no one in L.A. is ever going to do anything about it. Probably going to hear outraged noises for a few days, but politicians will quickly get back to showering the unhoused community with another billion dollars. 

What you're watching here is civilization collapsing in real-time, and it's not new. Video our producers shot in Los Angeles in the spring of 2019, almost three years ago, show homeless encampments downtown on three separate blocks. It starts at fifth and San Pedro, and then it goes west seemingly forever. So in January 2020, the L.A. Times reported that ""California's railroad tracks are now lined with men and women sleeping in tents or under cardboard boxes."" In America, by the way. Well, in response to this, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced another $12 billion in state funding to ""fight homelessness."" How'd that work? Well hear the results. 

So I guess they didn't clean up the railroad tracks $12 billion and disorder got worse, but of course, allowing people to live outside and defecate outside in public places and use drugs outside in front of our children is both the cause and a symptom of growing disorder and chaos. It's the degradation of what holds us together as a civilization. 

Our producers are back in L.A. right now shooting a documentary for season two of our """" series on Fox Nation, it's going to be out soon. They shot video on Skid Row in L.A., a 50-block neighborhood east of downtown. It's hard to overstate just how dystopian it is. You should go for yourself sometime and drive through. Roll your windows up, but watch. You will not believe this is America, the country you grew up in. 

This is what California got for $12 billion, not fewer homeless, just better funded homeless, and thousands more of them. So like COVID and Oxycontin and virtually everything else that's wrecking the country our ancestors built, this is a manufactured crisis. It didn't happen by accident. People paid for it. 

In New York, officials have given drug addicts priority over virtually everyone else in the city. A lot of working poor in New York, we ought to be celebrating them. The city isn't. It's ignoring them. 

In 2015, the annual budget of the New York City Department of Homeless Services was $950 million. This year, it's double that it's about $2 billion. How much is that? Well, what they're spending on the homeless in New York City is more than the city's entire public university system. More than they get, to educate far more people. So the homeless are getting more per student to live outside and smoke meth. 

Is that creating fewer homeless? Probably not. In fact, New York's homeless population is now at its highest level since the Great Depression. 

So where's all this money going specifically? Now, we could talk about this for hours, but here's just one example. That money is going to an overdose prevention center. Preventing overdoses, which in fact means helping the homeless get high. 

It's pretty funny watching people look confused as they see this. What's going on here? I don't remember this. It's not complicated at all. It couldn't be simpler. Politicians are making it much easier to be a homeless drug addict in the United States, and much harder to be a law-abiding member of the middle class. What's the effect? Well, let's see. The middle class is dying, and we now have record numbers of drugaddicted vagrants. 

What does that tell you? It tells you that incentives work. If you destroy the nuclear family, which they have; if you decriminalize drugs, which they have; if you hand out tents and needles to addicts, what do you think's going to happen? You're going to get more addicts living in tents. 

Again, it's not complicated. This is not a vexing public policy question that requires the Brookings Institution to investigate. It's not like fixing Social Security. 

And the solution is as simple as the problem. Here's a solution: Stop putting up with it. Say no. No, you can't smoke meth in the park. You're not allowed to crap on the sidewalk. Pull up your pants and get the hell out of here. Go somewhere with lower standards. Head for a place where politicians don't care about their people because we do care. And that's why we're hauling your tent to a landfill and cutting off your checks today. You are a drug addict. Get a job or leave. This is our city. You are not allowed to wreck it. You didn't build it. 

Now, that’s not hard. That works. We know it works because that's how societies function for about 2,000 years. If you're an unmarried man with no job, you were not allowed to destroy things. It wasn't your right. 

By the way, this is how successful families still operate to this day in the privacy of their own homes when the NGOs aren't watching. Parents reward good behavior, and they do not tolerate bad behavior. Why? Because if you let your kids smoke weed at the breakfast table, they will. So you don't let them. So why not apply the same standard to the drug addicts at Penn Station? Because what we're doing now isn’t compassionate. It's an attack on civilization.

586	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-world-no-longer-cares-what-joe-biden-says	2022-01-19 23:36:00	Tucker Carlson: The world no longer cares what Joe Biden says | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host examines the ‘massive implications’ of Biden’s policies.

 shuffled forth from seclusion this afternoon for a rare solo press conference. You may have seen it. It's about as common as Punxsutawney Phil emerging. In fact, according to statisticians who keep track of this sort of thing, it was only his second since taking office a full year ago. And by the end, you were wishing that Joe Biden spoke in public less often. 

The whole thing was awful, was totally weird and embarrassing, not just to him, but to the country. At one point, Biden treated us to a stream of consciousness thoughts about his son's former employer; that would be a small, corrupt nation called . Apparently, Ukraine's eastern border with  -- unlike, say, our  with Mexico -- is a sacred boundary created by God that must be protected at all costs, up to and including, American lives. Why is that? Joe Biden didn't say. 

The whole thing was confusing enough that we're going to spend some time unpacking it at much greater length on tomorrow's show. But in the meantime, here's what you should know. You are currently funding a proxy battle in Ukraine against the nuclear-armed Russian military, and that could very well erupt into a hot war that includes you, the United States. If nothing else, Biden made that very clear. So sleep well tonight. 

Then Biden bragged about himself, as he tends to do whenever he's awake. ""Can you think of any other president who's done so much in a year?"" he asked at one point. How do you respond to a question like that? Biden didn't wait for the answer. Instead, he got mad at a reporter who dared asked him about COVID. 

REPORTER: -

BIDEN: Why are you such an optimist? Look, I didn't overpromise, but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. 

Outperformed. Well, it’s true, actually. Outperform - meaning more Americans have died from  on my watch than under evil anti-science Cheeto man; which isn't easy you dog-faced, pony soldier. Stick that in your hat and smoke it. It got weirder from there. 

Biden talked about his so-called voting rights legislation, which only Nazis oppose. Without that legislation, the next election will almost certainly be fraudulent, rigged, illegitimate, stolen. See how that works? If you complain about an election after the fact, you're an insurrectionist. The  may indict you for sedition. But if you complain about an election ahead of time preemptively, then you're a civil rights leader. There's a difference, Mr. Man. Learn it. Love it, live it. 

Biden went on to boast under his steady, wise leadership, peasants in this country have gotten ""raises."" Now, he didn't mention that  has already eaten those raises in a single bite, and next year's raises too. But no one in the  bothered to ask anyway. Biden did allow that there are some Americans who are ""frustrated and fatigued,"" but that is not his fault. It's COVID’s fault, a disease created by unvaccinated Trump voters and not - we want to be clear about this - not created by his family's longtime patrons in the government of . They had nothing to do with it. You did it. In any case, the solution, Biden explained, is more testing and more shots. That's why he plans to send a COVID test to every American household and force every last holdout to get the vaccine. 

BIDEN: 

How many prepositions were slaughtered in those paragraphs you just heard? We lost count. But here's the headline, and you've never heard a president brag about this: We put soldiers in the hospitals. Biden said that's a win. So next time you get a prostate exam, rest easy. Men with guns are there, there's no reason to be afraid. But Biden is not stopping with that accomplishment. There's more to do. Joe Biden's next goal is to vaccinate all 8 billion people in the world by force, if necessary. And of course, we may need  for that too. 

BIDEN:  

The whole world. Those damn Africans better start taking the shots because walls don't work. You build a bigger wall. They just build a bigger virus. That's what the president said. If you take three steps back, it's kind of amusing in a sad way. Here you have daffy old Joe Biden still yammering on about vaccines -- Get your third shot or no hot dogs for you. That's an order. 

But actually, as he's been in seclusion in , the rest of the world has moved beyond borders. No one is listening to Joe Biden anymore. He is weak. He commands no respect. The world no longer cares what he says. As if to prove it, just hours before Biden spoke today, Starbucks -- the left-wing coffee chain and under usual circumstances, worships Joe Biden and his party -- Starbucks, announced its 200,000 employees no longer have to get the vaccine. It was mandatory in Starbucks. It's not anymore. They're dropping that requirement. 

Well, that's kind of a big change. This is in direct contradiction to Joe Biden's personal orders. Just a few weeks ago, Biden warned of a ""winter of severe illness and death."" What an upbeat guy he is. But only for the unvaccinated. And yet at Starbucks, the unvaccinated baristas are still standing, still pouring those lattes, and now they're getting back to work. What does this mean? Well, it means they decided the senile mannequin in the White House knows less about COVID than they do. And they may be on to something. 

Meanwhile, in , which is probably the most vaccinated country in the world, scientists just contradicted everything the administration's been telling us for a full year about vaccine passports and natural immunity. So a study in Israel, which no one has yet to denounce as misinformation, found that four vaccine shots do not work as well against Omicron as natural immunity does. And one of Israel's top vaccine experts admitted that natural immunity in general is highly effective. Watch this. 

REPORTER:  

COHEN:  

Better pull that man off , what does he know? That's Professor Cyrille Cohen. He's the head of immunology at Bar Ilan University. He's a member of the advisory committee for vaccines for the Israeli government. And obviously a thought criminal. What did he do? Well, he looked at the data and concluded that scientists have made a major mistake. ""The virus is better at immunizing than the vaccine."" 

Oh, where have you heard that? Well, we've known that for more than a year. Our own CDC found that natural immunity provided more protection against delta variant of COVID than vaccination did. Professor Cohen went on to apologize for the biggest mistake of the pandemic: shutting down schools and forcing children to stay home, which destroyed a generation. It turns out there was no scientific basis for doing that at all. It was all teachers’ unions wanting more time off. Omicron, the professor said, will turn this pandemic into the endemic phase. It'll be like the flu, a widespread but mild illness. Everybody gets it, and very few are badly hurt by it. And we should proceed accordingly. 

This has been pretty obvious. You'd never know it from listening to Joe Biden. He had no clue whatsoever. But Great Britain, which has been almost hysterical in the face of COVID, has come to the same conclusion. So today, as Joe Biden pushed everyone to take a third COVID shot, calling it the optimum protection you can have -- except for natural immunity, which tends to be much more effective. As he was saying that and being ignored. , the prime minister of Great Britain, announced an end to all mandates and all lockdowns in Great Britain, including in schools. Here's part of it. 

JOHNSON:  

So the United States used to lead the world, particularly in the . Modern science was essentially invented here. It was certainly perfected here. Now, the United States follows the world. Much smaller countries. Our two closest allies, in fact. Countries which have COVID at least as seriously as we did, have decided that what we've done for the last two years doesn't work. And they're changing their policies. They're freeing their population from the yoke of this insanity. 

All of that was happening at the very moment Biden was preparing for his big solo press conference. But apparently nobody told them what was happening. Our two strongest allies are doing this, and he didn't know. At the same moment that Boris Johnson announced that masks don't work, Joe Biden declared that he's going to send 400 million masks to American citizens so that every person in America can be safe for a day. 

It is lunacy. It's depressing to watch and has massive implications. Again, this is not global leadership, it's the opposite. This is what it looks like when you're a global laughingstock. Even Biden's aides know it. Watch Biden's own COVID adviser admit masks don't stop transmission. 

  

Okay, so that was in August, almost half a year ago. A few months later, in December last month, CNN's resident doctor admitted that it's true. Masks are useless. They've always been useless.  

DR. WEN: 

And yet Joe Biden is bragging that he's sending every American a mask so every American can be safe for one day. This is pathetic. Why are they doing this? It's a question worth asking, especially since Joe Biden knows the masks don't work. It's why he takes his mask off when it irritates him. Here he was just a few days ago. 

So Joe Biden knows masks don't work. CNN knows that masks don't work. Joe Biden's COVID advisers know that masks don't work. The country of Great Britain has admitted that in public. So with that in mind, here's what the Biden administration has been saying about masks for the last two months. Read the lies.

BIDEN: M

WALENSKY: . 

FAUCI: 

They act like there's no cost to covering your face. But the truth is, human beings need to see one another's faces. It's not optional. We pretend that it is. Any society that ignores natural imperatives, things as basic as seeing other people's faces, will destroy itself and the people who live within it. Everyone knows that. What you just saw is not science, it's mental illness. Joe Biden apparently doesn't know that, and that's why even Starbucks no longer listens to him.

587	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ukraine-russia-chinese-government	2022-01-20 23:58:00	Tucker Carlson: Our attention to Ukraine drives Russia into alliance with the Chinese government | Fox News	"Tucker Carlson discusses how Washington is reacting to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

There’s nothing more tiresome or predictable than a cable news host who makes the show about himself. Narcissism is to TV people what black lung is to coal miners, and we do our best to avoid catching it. But we're going to break our rule and tell you about something pretty interesting that happened to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" a couple of days ago. 

On Tuesday, we did a segment about the nation of . Now, Ukraine may be a perfectly nice place to visit, but you wouldn't think it would get a lot of attention from a superpower like this one. Ukraine is a pretty small country, really. It's in Eastern . It's 5,000 miles from . It's got a population about the size of the state of California. So hugely significant? Not really. And yet we never seem to stop talking about Ukraine. 

As the Vice President of the United States,  himself spent an enormous amount of his time meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine and because of his influence in that country, his son  got a job at a Ukrainian company and got rich from that. Then  was impeached for speaking on the phone to an official from, yes, Ukraine. 

And now, as of tonight, we're moving closer to a war over Ukraine. In the coming days,  may violate Ukraine's eastern border, and this, we are told, cannot stand. In Washington, the territorial integrity of the United States means precisely nothing. Walls are racist. We're a nation of immigrants. But the territorial integrity of Ukraine? That is something we must fight for. 

A remarkably broad spectrum of political figures appeared on all three  to explain that if Russians crossed the Ukrainian border in an undocumented caravan, we have a moral obligation to use force immediately. 

ADAM SCHIFF, CBS: 

ALEXANDER VINDMAN, MSNCB:  

REP. DAN CRENSHAW, FOX NEWS: 

REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, CNN: 

JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: 

Oh, they're all red in the face, but it's not the usual partisan chorus. This is the entire choir. You just saw representatives from every faction in Washington, from  to , not as different as they seem, and all the dummies in between. And all of them are promoting war against Russia on behalf of our new and deeply beloved ally, the government of Ukraine. 

 is our most dangerous enemy, they scream. We can't let him hurt Ukraine. So it turns out Russiagate was actually more effective even than we'd realize. The Steele dossier has been debunked. But in Washington, the theme remains in force: Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia is bad. What is this about, exactly? 

Well, obviously it's the usual collection of children falling for the usual collection of lies, but why this specific lie? On Tuesday, we tried to get to the bottom of this because it seems like it matters. We spoke to a man called Clint Ehrlich. As Ehrlich pointed out, there are a lot of factors here driving us toward war over Ukraine. But one of them, a central one, is NATO. So what is NATO and what is the purpose of NATO since the fall of the Soviet Union 30 years ago that NATO was designed as a bulwark against? 

Well, no one can answer that question. Not one person and yet the same people who cooked up the Iraq War are now insisting that Ukraine must join NATO anyway. That would mean putting American military hardware right on Russia's border, and Russia doesn't want that any more than we would want Russian missiles in Tijuana. Hence, the tension. Now the irony, as Clint Ehrlich pointed out, is that NATO doesn't even want Ukraine to join. In other words, the whole thing is nuts. It serves no American interest whatsoever. It is yet another manufactured crisis, this one devised by restless, power-hungry neocons in Washington looking for another war. Here's part of what Clint Ehrlich told us.  

EHRLICH:  

Well, that was an interesting conversation, and those seem like fair points. If they're wrong, go ahead and explain how they're wrong. We'll listen. But official Washington is done explaining anything, as you may have noticed. So instead, the very same foreign policy geniuses who brought slave markets to Libya went insane with rage. Not since we made fun of pregnant flight suits have they been this mad. ""Fox host unabashedly makes Putin's case,"" barked CNN's White House correspondent. ""Unabashedly,"" ""shows how the disinformation successes of Russian intelligence extend way beyond Trump."" ""Tucker is all-in for Putin,"" noted Bill Kristol, a man who couldn't even run a small circulation magazine, but imagines he should run our country's foreign policy. And then a former DNC contractor called Alexandra Chalupa announced that this shows opinions violated the law. ""This isn't journalism,"" she wrote. ""It's an ongoing FARA violation. Tucker Carlson needs to be prosecuted as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation and treason under Article 3, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution for aiding an enemy in hybrid warfare against the United States."" 

A death penalty offense! What Alexandra Chalupa didn't mention, speaking of FARA violations, is that she herself has extensive personal ties to the Ukrainian government. In 2016, Chalupa contacted Ukraine's embassy looking for dirt on Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Now, she says that anyone who doesn't believe Americans should die for Ukraine must be sent to prison. 

Virginia Congressman Gerry Connolly didn't go that far, but close. He called us ""right-wing agitator spewing Russian propaganda into millions of American homes."" Like a virus. And then Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, a man who literally had sex with a Chinese spy, apparently multiple times in very strange ways, agreed with this. ""Carrying Putin's water again,"" he wrote on Twitter. And then one of Barack Obama's speechwriters accused us of being ""on the side of ethno-nationalist authoritarianism."" Ethno-nationalism.

So if you don't support fighting a war on behalf of all White Ukraine against all White Russia, you my friend are a racist and so on. So what's so interesting here is that there was not a single argument, not a single idea in any of it. These aren't just Twitter trolls, these are people who imagine themselves, foreign policy heavyweights, deep thinkers, statesmen. But when challenged, all they could muster was name-calling. They went ad hominem immediately because they had nothing else. They're pathetic. 

That ought to worry you, though, because they may be pathetic. They're also very powerful. So in the end, it fell to poor  to explain why we need to fight for the honor of Ukraine. And she did it on The Today Show, the Biden administration's forum for deep thoughts on foreign policy. Here's what she said.

HARRIS: 

Reading her little talking points as vehemently as she can. But the best? The emphasis we place, the value we place, on territorial integrity. Borders. Sovereignty. The right to determine who comes into your country and when. That's the word from Kamala Harris, the lifelong open borders activist. 

So how should Putin handle this? Well, Putin had a better imagination, apparently he doesn't. He'd paint the Russian tanks now massed on the Ukrainian border with the slogan, ""No person is illegal."" What would Kamala Harris say to that? On what grounds would she tell Russians who just want a better life with their families in Ukraine that they can't come to Ukraine? If the Russians just quoted Emma Lazarus, Kamala Harris would have to back off and support them and their voting rights in Ukraine. 

But unfortunately for them, the Russians are just too literal for this. When they invade a country, just go ahead and call it an invasion. But you still have to wonder, invasion or not, why is any of this a profound concern of ours? Why would you even consider risking American lives or sending billions of dollars to stop it? There are multiple border wars underway around the world. Multiple just on the continent of Africa, right now. There always have been. Many are dying in those wars. And yet Kamala Harris is not agitating for American troops to Congo. How come? We can only speculate about that What we do know is that the administration's Russia policy would only make sense if your goal was to gravely hurt the United States of America. Already, we have spent nearly $4 billion in aid to Ukraine over the last few years, much of it for weapons. The point of this is to tweak Russia and, if necessary, to kill Russians. Our leads feel very superior about this, morally. They brag about it constantly. So it's an up, it's a win for them. But what about the cost to the rest of us and to our country? 

China is the preeminent threat to the United States. Nothing comes close to the threat that China poses. Here's the truth: The U.S. military, impressive as it is, is not big enough to engage meaningfully simultaneously in Europe and in Asia. Can't do both at the same time. 

So our attention to Ukraine, by definition, detracts from our attention to China. But worse and more dangerous than that, more dangerous than anything, it drives the Russians into an alliance of convenience of necessity with the Chinese government. So here you have our two biggest rivals, united. United not simply against our military, but against our currency. When the U.S. dollar is displaced as the world's reserve currency, this country will become poor overnight. This, what you're watching now, will be one of the reasons why it happened. So it's hard to imagine anything more significant or destructive than what these people are doing right now. It's not just about Ukraine, it's about our future.

588	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-war-russia-ukraine	2022-01-21 23:32:00	Tucker Carlson: We're moving closer to war with Russia | Fox News	"Tucker Carlson discusses the Russia-Ukraine conflict and how the U.S. is moving closer to a 'devastating' war.

Yesterday we talked about a kind of dark topic on the looming war between  and . A bipartisan coalition of neocons in Washington has been recklessly stoking conflict between those two countries for years now. Our foreign policy establishment, in fact, has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to one of the most volatile regions in the world, hoping for some kind of explosion.

And now their wish seems to be coming true. That explosion looks like it's on its way, and it could very easily suck the United States into the center of it. That's what we said last night. But honestly, as we read those words, they seemed hard to believe. We're really going to fight a war over some corrupt Eastern European country that is strategically irrelevant to us? With everything else that's going on right now in our own country? No normal person would ever want to do anything like that. How can it really happen? 

We're still not sure how it could happen, but nevertheless, it does seem to be happening right now. The Biden administration has begun evacuating American civilians from Ukraine. The Pentagon has announced it is prepared to use force in the region. So this country is now closer to a legitimate war than we have been in decades. And to be clear, we're talking about an actual war here. Not a protracted series of airstrikes against some impoverished dirt patch they're telling you is an existential threat to the nation. 

Russia is not a rock. Russia has nuclear weapons and a real army. A war with Russia is not a joke. It won't be over in a week. So you'd think right now might be the time the president of the United States could explain what's going on here? What exactly are we doing in Eastern Europe and why are we doing it? But no. In an exchange with reporters today,  explained that he wasn't going to take any questions at all for fear that someone might ask him about Russia. 

You guys will ask me all about Russia and Joe Biden's not falling for that one again, you can see why a couple of days ago he tried to talk about Russia during a press conference, and he got the talking points so mangled that his staff had to issue statements afterward, informing us that Joe Biden has no idea what he's talking about. Biden's mistake at the press conference was suggesting that maybe war with Russia is not inevitable. In Washington, you're absolutely not allowed to say that.  said it repeatedly. They impeached him for it. 

In Joe Biden's case, his handlers just stepped in and told us a brand-new story. Here's White House chief of staff and amateur comedian, Ron Klain, explaining that actually, this is what Joe Biden meant to say. And as you read to it, you may notice that it's the opposite of what Biden actually said. 

So this guy called Ron Klain, whoever that is, gets to overrule the president of the United States on matters of . Since when is he allowed to do that? Well, whenever he feels like it, that's the real answer. 

Joe Biden is the weakest leader this country has seen since Woodrow Wilson had a stroke in office. That's a problem, but it's not the core problem. The core problem is that in America, elected officials no longer decide when we go to war, as in, say, a democracy. 

Instead, bureaucrats, generals and defense contractors make those decisions, sometimes unilaterally. Here's failed rock star and hilariously inept Secretary of State Tony Blinken threatening severe action against Russia. 

So the president in states is not allowed to talk in public about Russia, he just admitted that today. He might say something that averts war. So instead, the same people who have lost the last five wars get to speak for him. Do you feel safer? 

You've got to wonder what voters think of this. We don't need to wonder what they think. Polls show that most Americans are completely opposed to fighting Russia over Ukraine because they're not demented. But you know who's very much in favor of it? Well, defense contractors, including Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin's former employer, Raytheon. 

For defense contractors, war means massive profits by definition. In just the last few years, the U.S. has spent more than $2 billion on military aid to this nation called Ukraine that most people couldn't identify on a map. Just the other day, the administration announced $200 million more. 

So the Ukrainians love this, obviously, this is the whole reason they once employed Joe Biden's otherwise unemployable son. To keep the cash flowing to them. So when Biden hinted this week that war might not be coming right away, the Ukrainians were highly distressed. In fact, they were so distressed, they said so out loud. 

So the Ukrainians are complaining about American foreign policy, about what the president said at a press conference. The government of someplace called Ukraine is demanding that we fight the Russian army on their behalf. OK, I mean, it's not crazy. You could kind of see why they would want that. It's a lot easier than doing it themselves. 

The question is, we're the United States, so why are we obeying them?

589	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-america-russia-ukraine	2022-01-25 00:10:00	Tucker Carlson: China is wondering how America could be this stupid and destructive | Fox News	"Tucker Carlson gives his take on escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

When permanent Washington pushes for war with , who benefits? We don't ask that question enough. The United States certainly doesn't benefit. That's obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a second. 

It's so glaringly obvious, in fact, that the people pushing this war immediately denounce you as a traitor if you point that out. They're betraying our country's interests, but somehow you're the one who's disloyal.  borders are sacred. Our borders are racist. Shut up, Putin stooge. 

But wait a second. Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine? They're both foreign countries that don't care anything about the United States. Kind of strange. It's all an absurd performance, but it's all they've got in the end. 

The fact is, Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to the United States. No rational person could defend a war with Russia over Ukraine. Nobody thinks a war like that would make America safer or stronger or more prosperous. Have you taken a look at our economy recently? Dangerous levels of inflation, a workforce in disarray. Wildly chaotic swings in financial markets, in case you ever noticed. 

Well, joining a conflict in Eastern Europe fix any of that? Come on. Of course not. It'll make it worse. If the neocons aren't restrained, and soon, Americans are going to be a lot poorer. 

So why are they doing this? That's a complex question. Hubris, stupidity, the damage, psychological makeup of our leaders. Massive lobbying campaigns by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors. All of those factors play a role in this. No tragedy has a single cause. 

But what's not at all complicated is who benefits from our conflict with Russia. China benefits, period. The Chinese government is the only certain winner here. We can give you many examples to illustrate this, but consider the latest economic sanctions the White House has proposed against Russia. 

The Biden administration may use something called the foreign direct product rule to cut off Russia's supply of semiconductors made with American technology. This would, in the hopeful assessment of  ""Potentially deprive Russian citizens of some smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.""

So depriving Russian citizens is good, we're told, because Russian citizens are bad. OK, but what are the long-term effects on us? Russians are still going to have smartphones. They'll just get their components somewhere else, meaning from . The Chinese have already pledged to help, and they have every incentive to make good on that promise. 

In other words, the Biden administration will succeed in continuing to drive our two main global rivals closer to a permanent alliance with one another. How does that help America? Well, it doesn't. Over time, it's dangerous, and not just militarily. 

The only reason the U.S. government can enforce international sanctions is that the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency. Russia and China don't like this, obviously. So let's say they convinced other global powers that the US government was abusing its monopoly on monetary control. If they do it to us, they might do it to you, they would say. And then other countries decided to drop the U.S. dollar in favor of a new currency. Where would that leave us? 

Well, suddenly the United States would no longer be able to run an economy based on debt. We would be impoverished immediately overnight. Has no one in Washington thought of this? Apparently not. Imposing tough new sanctions every few months feeds their moral vanity. It makes them feel like good people. What fools they are. 

Both parties, by the way, participate in this. Preening about sanctions on television is a lot easier than improving the lives of people in your own country. So that's what they do. 

Here's Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa telling you that protecting Ukraine's sacred borders is much more important than, say, saving Americans in Des Moines from overdosing on drugs. 

Those are our leaders, totally ignorant, just reading the script. It’d be nice to hear someone in the press corps, because it's their job, ask the obvious follow up, which would be: Why exactly, Sen. Ernst, do you believe it's so vital to send more lethal aid to Ukraine and to ""go ahead and impose"" more sanctions on Russia? Why? How would she answer that question? 

We'll never know how she'd answer, because no one in the media would ever ask her. Reporters are the most bovine of the herd animals. If the other kids say it's a good idea, they assume that it is. Journalists feel that way about everything, but especially about armed conflict. 

The longest war in American history just ended this fall when we left Afghanistan. The new consensus in Washington is: We need another war, now. And that view is especially prevalent in TV news. This Teleprompter jockey tried to push our Russia hating secretary of state into hating Russia even more. 

What's left to talk about? Too much diplomacy, Mr. Secretary, not enough killing. That's her position, apparently. 

Max Boot of The  fervently agrees with this. At this point, every project in Max Boot's life has collapsed into disaster, from his personal affairs to the war in Iraq, which he promoted endlessly. Having come to middle age, Max Boot is unequivocally a failure. But he's looking for one last war to redeem at all. He's thinking conflict with nucleararmed Russia could be that war. 

Again, you have to ask yourself, why is it more patriotic to take one country's side than the other country's side? We have no obligation to defend any country, either one of these countries. Neither one is American. Neither one has the same interests as we do. Why is it wrong to support one and not the other? 

What's wrong is to support either one of them. Their interests are not the same as ours. They're very different. Max Boot doesn't care. Arm the Ukrainians, prepare for guerrilla warfare. Only a man completely insulated from the consequences of his bloodlust could talk like that. There will always be another think tank job for Max Boot and people like Max Boot. 

But what's Politico's excuse? The fashionably liberal political blog has been pushing for war in Ukraine for months now. Why? What's in it for them? Well, let's see. 

A few days ago, Politico published this terrifying headline ""Psaki: Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine."" The piece goes on to promise that ""experts and policymakers are now preparing for a range of escalatory measures."" 

Well, that sounds scary. We better send billions more in military hardware to Ukraine right away. Beneath the headline, you learn why Politico is interested. Because the story is ""presented by Lockheed Martin."" Aha! In other words, defense contractors think it is high time to spend much more on defense contracting in Ukraine. Politico is happy to make their case in exchange for money. 

Over at The Washington Post, you may have seen an oped with this headline: ""Biden must show that the United States stands ready to support Ukraine militarily if necessary."" Now, that piece was written by a man called Michael Vickers, who's Michael Vickers, among other things. Michael Vickers sits on the board of the weapons contractor BAE Systems. 

That would seem relevant because war with Russia would be potentially, in any case, highly profitable for VA systems. But somehow, the Washington Post didn't bother to tell readers about this. It remained undisclosed. 

So how does this look from across the world? Well, the Chinese must be watching this happen with their jaws open, completely delighted. They can't believe their good fortune. They watch as the entire political leadership class of the United States runs at full speed in the wrong direction. Away from Asia, which is so clearly the future and toward the murky past on the fringes of Eastern Europe. Ukraine. Russia. 

The Chinese must be wondering how could these people be so stupid and so self-destructive?

So here's a weird story - so many of those these days - if you were anywhere near the  in Washington this past spring, you may have seen a black box truck with New Jersey plates and a billboard on the side parked by the side of the road. The message read ""Breyer, Retire. It's time for a Black woman Supreme Court justice. There's no time to waste."" Those billboards were funded by a group of progressive  called Demand Justice, which weirdly enough is run by an extremely White guy called Brian Fallon, which is a little strange if you think about it. 

If Brian Fallon is so passionate about giving leadership roles to Black women, why hasn’t he resigned from his job and given it to one? You wonder that about a lot of people. , for example. 

In any case, you've got to hand it to Brian Fallon. Either he is remarkably prescient or someone in power was listening to him, because just this morning was announced that Stephen Breyer is indeed retiring from the Supreme Court. 

And you notice the passive construction there. It was announced. Because Breyer himself did not announce his retirement. It's not even clear Breyer knew the announcement was going to happen. Someone leaked that news with or without Justice Breyer's consent. They didn't wait for him to do it himself. Why? Well, because Democrats understand they're likely to lose the Congress this November. They want to control Breyer’s seat while they still can. So what are they going to do with that seat? We don't need to guess. Joe Biden was very clear about his plans nearly two years ago as he was running for president. He didn't tell us what he was going to do about  or foreign policy or the economy, but he was very precise about the Supreme Court. 

Here's Biden in March 2020 on the debate stage of CNN:

I will appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. That was Biden's promise. All right. But which Black woman exactly? Biden didn't tell us. Biden didn't mention the Supreme Court nominee’s legal qualifications or judicial philosophy or ability to perform one of the most important jobs in the country. He didn't even tell us she was a nice person. All he said was she's going to be Black and she's going to be female, because to him, that's all that mattered. 

You almost got the impression that Joe Biden believes all Black women are the same. They're identical. It was certainly the assumption in the Delaware of Joe Biden's youth 60 years ago. Biden doesn't seem to have changed much. 

You wonder if anyone sitting there in  audience that night even noticed this. It's possible we've all marinated for so long in the casual racism of affirmative action that it seems normal now to reduce human beings to their race. But imagine if this was happening to you. How would you feel? You go to law school, you win a clerkship, you get a seat on some lower court. One day you're nominated to be one of the top nine judges in the country. And you're proud of that. Why wouldn't you? Your parents are proud. Your friends are proud. 

But Joe Biden, all Joe Biden can talk about is your skin color. Patronizing doesn't even begin to describe what this is. This is exactly why decent Americans hated segregation. It dehumanized people. Now, Biden claims that his race counting is essential so that the court and the rest of his administration ""look like America."" 

Of all the lies that Joe Biden tells, this could be the easiest to check. We have the latest census numbers, and we can promise you with dead certainty that Joe Biden's nominees look nothing like America, not even close. 

Is that a problem? Well, the problem for Biden is that once he starts saying things like this, once he begins to promise to represent every possible ethnic voting bloc equally, like some ward boss in 1950 Chicago, people are going to start to wonder about their representation. As long as we're divvying up the spoils like carrot cake, where's my slice? 

So, Biden will nominate a Black woman. Great, she'll represent about seven percent of the population. But where's Biden's Pacific Islander nominee? Mazie Hirono, is probably writing an outrageous letter about that right now. No doubt she is. 

And why isn't there an American Indian on the court or a genderqueer or someone from the chronic fatigue syndrome community or a justice with cognitive disabilities? Why isn't there an Afghan refugee under consideration? You can laugh, but suddenly these are entirely fair questions, and by the way, Joe Biden, you claim that trans lives matter, really, do you really mean that? Then prove it? What kind of woman is this anyway you plan to nominate? What are her pronouns? 

You can see where this is going, where it always goes. Identity politics always ends with tribal warfare. It's funny the Biden people can't see that maybe they can see it and don't care, or maybe it's the entire point of the exercise. 

Whatever the explanation, the  has no choice at this point but to make good on Joe Biden's promise. Usual race mongers spent all day demanding it. Here's CNN: 

Oh, this is so great, that lady, especially. Here you have the most privileged people in the United States of America telling you at high volume with total certainty, they're victims. Now that could describe most of CNN’s programming, actually. But that was especially hysterical. That oppressed woman is Laura Coates. Laura Coates went to an expensive private school in Minnesota. Then she headed off to Princeton, and then she went to law school. Now she's on TV, all because of how victimized she has been. 

It's almost enough to make you like America when you learn that someone that completely marginalized is now so powerful. Sounds like a success story. But no, explains Laura Coates. In fact, it's still more evidence that America is an evil and racist place. 

How much does John King hate himself? He's got to, right, on some level saying stuff like that. What would it be like to finally see some of the Supreme Court who looks like you. Thank God. Finally, Laura Coates can have some justice in this country at long last. Maybe someone will send her to Princeton for free again just to make it official. She's been liberated. 

But wait a second, color counters. What about Clarence Thomas? He's sort of vaguely looks like Laura Coates, the lady you just saw on TV. Same race anyway. Does he count? No, he doesn't count. Clarence Thomas isn't a race monger. He believes in the Constitution of the United States. He’s a Supreme Court justice. Therefore, he's not really Black. See how that works? He doesn't count. 

So who are the potential nominees CNN has declared are authentically Black and therefore eligible for this job? Well, let's see. There’s Sherrilyn Ifill. She’s not even a judge. She's some kind of political activist who works at the NAACP. Her primary credential, and she listed this prominently in her online biography herself, is that she was one of Glamor Magazine's Woman of the Year in 2020. Laugh, if you will. But I mean, why is that not a qualification? Glamor Magazine’s Woman of the Year in 2020? Sends her forth to the Supreme Court. 

And then look at her Twitter page. Ifill’s Twitter page is full of racist attacks against dreaded White people. Here's one example from July of 2018. ""Truth and reconciliation efforts have little chance in many places because Whites view truth-telling is an act of violence."" 

Really? They do? All Whites? Yes. According to Sherrilyn Ifill, they're all the same. Same skin color. Same belief. Now, that's a common attitude on the left is not a reassuring attitude for a Supreme Court justice. We'll see how she does. 

Meanwhile, CNN is also recommending a woman called Eunice Lee. Eunice Lee may be a perfectly nice person, we don't know, but she first became a judge in August 2021. That was, let’s do the math, less than six months ago. 

Candice Jackson Academy has even less experience and she may be nice as well, but she reached the bench for the first time in July of last year. 

The other nominees on CNN's list have more judicial experience. We'll give you three guesses to how they got that experience. How’d they get there? Wilhelmina Mimi Wright, became an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court back in 2012. Now, the sad thing about what we're about to tell you is Mimi Wright may be the best judge ever, the smartest person ever. But as always, the media minimized her, dehumanized her in its coverage. 

The media celebrated her nomination not because of her legal ability, which they barely describe, but because of the way she looks her skin color. And that is a big part of why Gov. Mark Dayton appointed her in the first place. He said that. Here's how the Star Tribune covered her appointment. ""Dayton's historic choice first black female Supreme Court justice."" That was the headline. 

Unmentioned is how she might do on the Supreme Court. Again, nobody wins in identity politics. The people it's designed to help are completely dehumanized and patronized, reduced to colors rather than human beings. And in some cases, the rest of us get really crappy service because the best people aren't being chosen. That's just true. 

Ability is the only criterion that matters. Skin color is relevant. Ketanji Brown Jackson got the same treatment. To be fair, we should note that, unlike other candidates CNN is putting forward, Brown Jackson has authentically suffered in her life. She's not joking. She literally went to Harvard with Joy Reid. 

Imagine what that was like. You went to college with Joy Reid? I was in Fallujah. You went to college with Joy Reid, who suffered more? Well, after leaving the rough and tumble of Cambridge with Joy Reid, Brown Jackson wound up on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last summer. What were her credentials? Here’s how ABC News covered her confirmation at the time. They told us Jackson is ""the first Black woman confirmed to an appellate court in a decade,"" and she now is one of five Black female Circuit Court judges currently serving. But hey, who's counting? 

You have to wonder - Brown Jackson, and we don't know, may be a super great person, a really smart person – but would you feel if you were her? What about her achievements? Irrelevant. The media focused on her race, and maybe there was a reason for that because her actual record as a judge is honestly pretty awful. She's been overturned unanimously by the D.C. appellate court multiple times in just the past few years. 

So you have to wonder at this point since we’re going by skin color and gender, why Joe Biden is ignoring the obvious choice. Why doesn't Biden strike a real blow for equity and just nominee Bridgett Floyd? Who’s that? Well, it’s George Floyd's sister. She's not a judge or a lawyer or whatever. But at this stage, who cares? Clearly, that's not the point anymore. This law stuff. 

As Nebraska Senator Roman Hruska once said in defense of one of Richard Nixon's dumber judicial nominees ""even if he is mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They're entitled to a little representation, aren't they?"" Well, sure, they are, Bridgett Floyd could be justice for the rest of us. Or at least a slice of the rest of us.

591	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-infrastructure-spending-roads	2022-01-28 00:39:00	Tucker Carlson: $1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending should mean better roads, but it doesn't | Fox News	"Tucker Carlson investigates what Democrats consider as 'infrastructure.' 

Think back, you may remember  infrastructure bill this fall. That bill emerged from  in November with a price tag of $1.2 trillion dollars. That so many zeros it's hard to imagine. How much is it? It's more than the entire GDP of the Nation of , one of the world's biggest oil producers, by the way. So that's a ton of money. 

So for a bill that size, you would expect, well, big results. You'd certainly want better roads than they've got in Mexico. So we're getting those what are we getting exactly from that bill? Well, today the Transportation Department, which is now run by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, finally told us the answer. Effective immediately, we learned this country will undergo a ""paradigm shift"" in the way we think about infrastructure. 

Now, hold on a minute. As you probably noticed by this point, the moment paradigms start shifting, you can be certain a whole lot of people are about to get shafted. Nothing personal. It's just the nature of paradigms. They don't just shift. They tend to topple over and crush innocent bystanders. And this paradigm, of course, is no different. 

According to the new paradigm we learned about today, infrastructure is no longer about roads and bridges and airports and train stations and things you might actually use in the course of your life. We could fix those things, but why bother?  has better ideas. Here's Mr. Douglas Emhoff, the profoundly unemployed husband of Kamala Harris, to explain. 

It deeply understands. We're not just talking about things you care about anymore. Mr. and Mrs. America, those stupid buildings and roads and bridges, things that you can touch. We're talking about bigger things now. We're talking about vast structural problems, problems so big that unemployed Doug Emhoff can't even really describe them, much less solve them. Things like ""the safety of our children"" and our families. 

Turns out, big problems are a lot safer to talk about in speeches because you can't actually do anything about them. So there are no expectations. Roads and bridges and buildings are very different from that. They need concrete and asphalt and rebar - stuff that's expensive and hard to do. And that may be why our buildings, roads and bridges are falling apart. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, which keeps track of these things, there are more than 617,000 bridges in this country, and as of tonight, more than 46,000 of those bridges are considered ""structurally deficient."" That means they're in terrible shape. Kind of a big deal for a bridge. 

As for our roads, fully 43% of all public roadways in this country are ""in poor or mediocre condition."" In other words, we actually are Mexico, though a lot richer. 

So what are we going to do about this? What is the $1.2 trillion dollar plan going to do for our crumbling infrastructure? Well, Pete Buttigieg has a plan. Here it is: More speed cameras, according to The Associated Press, Pete Buttigieg would like to quote promote greater use of speed cameras, which the department says could provide more equitable enforcement than police traffic stops. 

Got that? So because of equity, you're about to get a lot more speeding tickets from robots. See how that works? Shut up, racist, pay the fine. The government does need the money for infrastructure even after $1.2 trillion. 

A recent New York Times piece put it this way: ""When California voters approved a bond in 2008 for a High-Speed rail system from L.A. to San Francisco, the project was supposed to cost $33 billion and be completed by 2020. That job is now projected to finish in 2033 for $100 billion, though those estimates are dated and there is an $80 billion funding gap."" 

So infrastructure is expensive. Actually, no one really knows how much infrastructure costs because infrastructure never gets completed. There are still working trains in the state of California. Unfortunately, they're now getting robbed just like they were in the 1870s. Return to the future. 

Union Pacific is now contemplating abandoning the state after more than 150 years there. Kind of a big deal. What does Mayor Pete think of this? He's the  secretary. Hasn't said a single word about it. Of course, there's nothing to do with equity. So it's beneath his radar. 

By the way, it's not just trains that are in trouble in this country. We're also short 80,000 truck drivers. And that could be part of the reason that these shelves at your local grocery store are getting bare. And it's not just trucks, either. By next year, airlines are expected to be short more than 10,000 pilots. And that's why between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, airlines canceled more than 10,000 flights. That was this year. Good luck getting to Florida next year. 

Now, there are other causes of the cancelations, none of which Mayor Pete is doing anything to fix. He's for vaccine mandates, of course, that was a huge cause of the shortage this year. And then there are others. 

So the president of Emirates, probably the best airline in the world, a man called Tim Clark, recently slammed Mayor Pete and the administration for the disastrous rollout of 5G technology in your airports, which led to a total suspension of Emirates flights. Clark said it was, ""one of the most delinquent, utterly irresponsible decisions he's ever seen in his long career."" Fox's Casey Stegall has covered the collapse of the transportation network in this nation. Here's an overview:

Things were bad in Virginia. But it's not just Virginia. Officials in Connecticut, recently reported 285 car crashes because of ""icy weather."" Oh, forgot to salt the roads. 

Same in New York state. Westchester County. People killed? Oh, forgot to salt the roads. The feds didn't salt the roads. People died. What does that do with equity? 

So here you have roads you can't drive on, airports that don't work, planes that don't take off and trains that are getting robbed. These are not small things. When your transportation network falls apart in a continental country, things grind to a halt. Everything depends upon moving objects and people from one place to another, because it's a huge country. 

So, if you have problems like these which are central to our economy and the way we live to the country itself, it might be a good idea to hire a competent transportation secretary. But that's not what the Biden administration did. They had a more progressive idea. 

Joe Biden hired a kid, by contrast, who had never had a real job outside McKinsey and no grounding of any kind in physical reality. We know this because he was the mayor of South Bend. 

So what's the infrastructure like in South Bend when Pete Buttigieg was mayor? The city had ""the worst pothole situation in the state,"" according to the local paper. Huge potholes. So big that Mayor Pete, not a tall man, could have disappeared into one. Picture his little legs up in the air. Eight years as mayor, and he was never able to fix it.

So a guy who literally couldn't fix the potholes in South Bend, Indiana, is now the transportation secretary. But he breastfeeds, so it's equity. It's unbelievable. Pretty amusing. This is a guy who wouldn't know a car transmission from a bridge abutment. What are the chances he can run his own espresso machine? 

The mindset is the problem here, and it's not just Mayor Pete, he's easy to mock because he's a ludicrous figure. But it's all the people like him who believe our economy is based on social media apps and H.R. departments. People like that really believe that by social engineering, you can make the trains run on time and you can create a robust economy. Because they're morons. 

For example, last week. Mayor Pete explained that the number one priority of the transportation department in the middle of a massive shortage of transportation workers - trains are getting robbed, planes that won't take off - is equity. 

So you know what we need to do? We need to work extra hard to screen out anybody who might be working in our transportation industry who happens to have the wrong skin color.

So that's kind of the problem, and that's been the problem with our trains and planes and automobiles for a century now. Too many White people in them. Got a lot of White airline pilots. That's the problem. Mayor Pete just said that. It doesn't have to be this way. That's equity. 

So this is where you're $1.2 trillion dollars is going. To what is - not to get technical – an illegal campaign to hire workers on the basis of their skin color. So, Mayor Pete, you may have noticed is the wrong skin color. And as long as you want to diversify and equity transportation, why is he running the department? Because he's too important to give up his job to an unqualified Haitian migrant. That's because Mayor Pete can see the big picture. He understands every transportation decision is in fact, something so much bigger.

We couldn't understand everything, he said, because for some reason he had a freaking mask on his face. Maybe he was robbing a train. Not clear. We've got a reporter getting to the bottom of that. But we think he said his job is to work on climate. It's funny. When the country applauded $1.2 trillion going to fixing the roads, bridges and buildings, a lot of us were dumb enough to think that's what might actually happen.

592	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-russia-media-ukraine	2022-01-28 22:59:00	Tucker Carlson: The media thinks we, and the president of Ukraine, are agents of Russia | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' explains why the president is 'panicked' about Ukraine. 

If you've been following the news at all recently, you know that  is just seconds away from invading our ancient ally, our closest friend on the world stage, that would be the sovereign nation of . In response to this news, lovers of democracy everywhere are horrified. This is a slow-motion disaster. In effect, it's the first domino. 

First, the Russians come for Ukraine. Next, it's Bangor, Boise, Bakersfield. What Vladimir Putin plans next will make Red Dawn look like a documentary. So, of course, defenders of democracy everywhere are horrified by this, and they're ready to fight. Now, NATO, whose job it apparently is to contain Russia, has not yet committed to defending Ukraine for some reason. But patriotic Americans are not waiting for NATO. That's not their way. According to a piece in BuzzFeed, American citizens are joining the fight on their own. It's their Spanish Civil War. They're paying their way to Ukraine to defend the noble Ukrainian people against the dastardly Russian hordes on the frozen steppe. 

But strangely, and this is weird, we have no confirmation tonight that David Frum, Max Boot and Liz Cheney have left yet for Kyiv, and maybe they're still oiling their rifles and gathering their kit, or maybe they've decided to man the cable news barricades. Just because they're technically behind the lines doesn't make their service less perilous or important, and someday they're all going to get medals for the sacrifices they're now making in CNN Studios in New York City. And we plan to cover that ceremony live. 

But in the meantime,  seems most worried of all. Joe Biden is so panicked about what's about to happen to Ukraine, he makes Bill Kristol seem understated and restrained. And that's not really surprising, because Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He's got access to all the latest intel. It's delivered to him daily by the weapons of mass destruction division at . Those guys are on it. 

This week, Biden got so concerned after reading what the CIA delivered him, he's so worried about what's about to happen to Ukraine, that Joe Biden called the president of Ukraine to warn him about his fate. And then someone in the intel community leaked the transcript of that call to CNN, not for the first time. 

Woah. irst, we should note that CNN is perfectly capable of taking spin-filled propaganda calls from agents of the Ukrainian government, but you can't talk to Russia because that's treason. But here's the headline: It looks like there is daylight between the world's two closest leaders - brothers, really. And that suggests there might be a breach in the unbreakable bond forged over centuries between Ukraine and the United States. This is from CNN's Natasha Bertrand. She did this reporting: ""Per a senior Ukrainian official … Biden told President Zelensky that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is now virtually certain and that Kyiv could be sacked. Prepare for impact. Biden reportedly said President Zelensky disagreed and, as I reported, asked him to tone down the rhetoric."" 

What? Joe Biden is more worried about Russia than the president of Ukraine is? It looks that way. Because not long after that reporting, CNN said Natasha Bertrand deleted that tweet. Oh, and then an hour later, CNN's Jim Sciutto contradicted CNN's own previous reporting. He tweeted out this White House statement, which CNN qualifies as reporting, a statement from the White House. Here's what it said: ""WH on Biden-Zelensky call: ‘Anonymous sources are ’leaking' falsehoods. President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months…Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false. … Also this: ""Also, no one said ‘sacked.’ The only person who should be ‘sacked’ is the anonymous source who is circulating an inaccurate portrayal of this conversation."" 

Not an actual denial, therefore it's true. It's an amazing sequence, really, if you think about it. So Biden tells the Ukrainian president that his capital city is about to be sacked like Rome in the fifth century, blood and screams, fire, spears and swords, seizures and trebuchet, a horrible scene. And Ukrainians, in response to this, ""calm down, dude, you're freaking me out. Toughen up, you sound like a terrified old woman.""

Now, the White House claims that conversation never happened, but clearly, it did happen because at a press conference today, President Zelensky said virtually the same thing to the media. 

So David Frum and Joe Biden have gotten Americans so whipped into a frenzy over the future of Ukraine that they're flying to Ukraine to risk their lives in defense of that sacred nation's sovereignty. And there's the president of Ukraine saying ""We're not that concerned."" 

So what can we infer from this? Well, it's simple. If you're not terrified about the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the question is whose side are you on here? Whose side are you on? And we know the answer to that question. You're on Vladimir Putin's side. So it looks like the president of Ukraine himself has been compromised by Russian misinformation. The Ukrainian president is what we on cable news refer to as an agent of Putin, and that means the Russians are so diabolically effective they've recruited the guy they're preparing war against. How clever is that? It would take a Slavic mind to pull that off? 

And by the way, yes, we are calling the president of Ukraine an agent of Putin, but we're not judging him. In fact, we can relate. We can empathize because, as you know, if you watch the media where agents are put in to. 

Mr. Max Boot, Ladies and gentlemen in his final domestic television appearance before he heads to Ukraine to defend that nation himself, its territorial integrity, from the aggression of Vladimir Putin. Watch him while you can. 

But let's be clear about what the terms are. In the United States - and this does not apply to Ukraine, where they have probably the more sane view of it, or maybe just more Russian influence - but in the United States, if you raise any questions about the wisdom of siding, in a war in Eastern Europe, with one country over another, you are by definition, an agent of the single greatest threat to democracy on this globe, Mr. Vladimir Putin himself. You're treasonous. 

Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey is claiming that viewers of this show, Russian Robots to a man, reached out to his office and did something horrifying, something they probably should be legal, they said ""maybe we shouldn't go to war over Ukraine.""

Yeah. A lot of people said, Tom Malinowski, you know, is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, right? Even by the standards in New Jersey. However, he makes a really good point. There are people out there who look around and decide, maybe, I don't know, homelessness - close to a million people living on the street in the United States – 100,000 Americans dying of drug overdoses, inflation, the fact our schools haven't taught anything in over two years, maybe these are more important concerns in the territorial integrity of a country we can't find on a map. Maybe our own territorial integrity is more important than Ukraine's. And the question Rep. Malinowski raises is why would they ever think that? Where would they get the idea that their stupid, parochial domestic concerns are more important than Ukraine's eastern border? And the answer, of course, is Vladimir Putin. They've obviously fallen for the Russian propaganda. That would be us doing Vladimir Putin's bidding. Like the president of Ukraine, we're guilty.

Do you ever notice how almost all of the leaders of almost all the countries in the  world, particularly in the English-speaking Western world, seem kind of the same? They're what we call neoliberal. They're all weak and fearful, if you think about it. And yet if you listen to them talk, you'd think they were omnipotent: 'We're going to reverse global climate change. We're going to vaccinate the world. We're going to end all human prejudice and replace it with equity. We're going to spread democracy to the untutored nations with guns, and they're going to love us for it. We can do all these things because we're all-powerful. We're like gods. You shall have no gods before us.' 

Now, mostly they're puny people. But when they speak, they sound like Caesar standing in purple robes in the forum, commanding the known world.  very often sounds like this, so does that squeaky little woman with weird teeth who runs New Zealand. They all sound like this. They're unbelievably grandiose. It's by design. They'd rather talk about redeeming humanity than bother to fix your kid's  or replace the stop sign at the end of your block. 

So you've got to wonder, why do they talk this way? And the answer, of course, is because they're terrified. They claim to be powerful because they know they're not. It's a bluff. It's a calculated pose. In fact, they know exactly how weak they are. They understand how little popular support they actually have, and they can feel their grasp slipping. And if you wonder if that's true, notice how they overreact to the slightest challenge to their power. Remember a year ago when the QAnon Shaman skipped through  on his mescaline trip, giggling and spreading good vibes? It was kind of amusing. But  in Washington were panicked by it, so panicked they called in the  and sent that poor guy to prison. It's weird how touchy they get when you suggest they stole the presidential election, I wonder why?

But this is not the behavior of secure leaders. This is how despots act when they fear they're about to be overthrown. And there's no more fearful despot in the world than  of Canada. Over the span of just a few years, Trudeau has turned a nation long famous for Molson and sled dogs in niceness into a relentlessly punitive surveillance state. People have long whispered, in dead seriousness, that Justin Trudeau is the biological son of Fidel Castro. You could laugh it off, but now it's becoming pretty easy to believe. Trudeau has used systematically  to short circuit democracy in Canada and to end organized  there. 

 can no longer travel freely within their own country. They can no longer return to their own country at certain parts. Pastors have been imprisoned for holding church services. The unvaccinated can be sent to jail for buying certain products in stores. In the town of Gatineau, family members were arrested for celebrating New Year's Eve in their own home. Every large institution in Canada pretends like all of this is perfectly normal, it's always been this way. Canadian media, which are largely controlled by the government, support these policies and Trudeau uncritically. In Nova Scotia, protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates are now banned by law. 

Rarely has a nation changed this quickly or more unequivocally for the worse. And last week, thousands of Canadian truckers reached their limit. A convoy of truckers converged on the capital city of Ottawa to demand, peacefully, cheerfully but persistently an end to Justin Trudeau's tyranny. Justin Trudeau's response to this display of democracy? He fled the city. Trudeau evacuated his official residence and hid in an undisclosed location. He is still cowering there tonight. Will he come back? Has he abdicated? Will Canada be ruled by a junta of truckers? Well, not at this point. He emerged by video conference from his lair to declare that Canadian citizens who disagree with him are in fact attacking democracy. 

TRUDEAU:  

So expressing your views is an attack on democracy? And by the way, how dare you express your views as if you were free people. That's tyranny. Democracy is when you obey like serfs. Trudeau just effectively said that. And then because he has no self-awareness whatsoever, Trudeau announced that he's contracted COVID, which is perfect. In other words, take this shot or else, as you can see from the fact I am now sick, it works perfectly. 

If Canada were in a country, it would be a remarkable dark comedy. So you may be wondering about these hordes of Visigoths who's descended on Ottawa, the ones who drove Justin Trudeau out of the city. What do they look like? 

Freedom, love, patriotic displays waving Canadian flags. Terrifying. But if you look closely at those pictures, you can see the real problem. These were working-class people. They're the guys who deliver your Amazon boxes. And Justin Trudeau is repulsed by them. These people have stepped way outside their lanes. Just leave the package on the porch and get the hell out of here. But they haven't gotten the hell out of there. They're still in Ottawa, and Justin Trudeau won't meet with them because he never meets with people like this, not simply because they are blue-collar and dirty, though obviously they are, but because they disagree with him. As a reminder from Justin Trudeau, that's what democracy is. Democracy is lecturing people who nod a lot in response. Watch him explain. 

So I'll meet with the people at a rally as long as I agree with their goals, as long as they agree with me, it's totally fine, like Black Lives Matter. You get the sense even someone as dim as Justin Trudeau realizes this is not a winning argument. He needed his friends in state media to help. So they trotted out some attack lines against the truckers lines they borrowed directly from CNN and NBC News here in the States. So here's Canada's state broadcaster inventing a claim, out of nothing, that Vladimir Putin himself may be responsible for this trucker convoy. 

. You've got to love Canada. But let's be honest, they always steal our ideas and produce a slightly shoddy copy of them. We have Wal-Mart, they have Canadian Tire, not to be mean. Russia, of course, Putin did it. There's no evidence of that. No sources. They've just been reading American Twitter. And the state media anchor is deeply concerned. Who buys this? No one's going to buy this, it's so prima fascia absurd, so they just kept going. Here's Justin Trudeau from his bunker offering yet another reason to distrust the hunta  running the newly formed nation of Truckistan, formerly known as Canada. 

TRUDEAU

Dishonor the memory, too many Canadian flags. There are like three bad people in the crowd, so ignore them all, ladies and gentlemen. Thankfully, by contrast, no one in any BLM rally ever torched a courthouse or shot anybody or burned down a building. But these truckers, apparently, there was a racist flag. So pay no attention. Now in the United States, we probably wouldn't fall for this at this late date. We're a little jaded at this point because we've seen it so many times. Oh, they had a Confederate flag, never mind, we can ignore their concerns. The election was totally fine.

So again, we've seen it before. But in Canada, they probably haven't seen it, they're a few years behind us. And so, you know, they're kind of impressed by it. Claims like this happened here a few months ago, as you may remember, when Democratic operatives carried around tiki torches to smear Glenn Youngkin as a White supremacist. Again, Trudeau had reason to think Canadians hadn't seen that, and he might be able to get away with it. Trudeau has been honing this line of argument for months now. Last September, you may remember he accused people who opposed mandatory vaccination, getting a shot because the government requires it, of being racist. 

TRUDEAU:  

Poor Canadians. They're good people. They don't have a lot of news sources. They've been exposed nonstop for two years to this kind of propaganda. If you don't believe in mandatory injection with an experimental medicine, you're a racist. Apparently, some believe it, at least one counter-protester this weekend believed it. 

REBEL NEWS: 

:  

Oh, thank God for Rebel News. You think Fox is an anomaly in the United States, how would you like to be Rebel News? Literally the only people in all of Canada who are playing it straight. So there they are, trying to tell you that some guy from the subcontinent is a w=White nationalist. They're trying, they're trying hard. And now they have evidence, it's brought to you by CNN, naturally, working in tandem with the CBC. Apparently, brace yourselves, there was a  sign in the crowd of truckers. 

CNN:  

JIM ACOSTA CNN:  

Now we don't know who that woman is, but she should be completely ashamed of herself. She's a journalist, and yet she just told you that the ruling party of Canada wants the people who are protesting their policies to leave. And then she nods gravely that they need to leave. Things need to get back to normal. They've got to run the city doing all the important things that Canadians do in Ottawa. CNN is siding openly with the Trudeau government, because you can't challenge power. I mean, that's what we do in the media is to remind you: Obey, accept your fate, rich people have spoken, get in line. And we've got a Trump flag to prove it. 

But it gets worse. There were more racist flags this weekend. One of them imported conspicuously from this country. Now we have definitive evidence of this. We're getting this from Canadian media that there was a racist in the crowd. 

TWITTER VIDEO (to a man holding a confederate flag):  

Oh, it's so great. You'll notice in the shot there's only one person who has his face completely covered. And he happens to be carrying a Confederate flag. Now the crowd looks at him and says, oh, wait a second, we know who you are, you're Ray Epps. Oh, sorry, but we don't trust you. In exactly the way the crowd in Washington the night before January 6th of last year said to Ray Epps, Get out of here, fed. 

So the people on the scene didn't believe that guy was anything but a provocateur, and we don't know exactly who he was. We'll let you make your own conclusions from that. But we're supposed to believe that this one guy in the full face mask with a Confederate flag proves the entire protest is racist. Justin Trudeau has every reason to run away like a terrified, wuss that he is, and we can ignore the concerns of the people in the trucker convoy. But we've got a couple of questions. 

Who exactly was that guy holding the flag and where is Justin Trudeau right now? It's not clear where he was broadcasting from this weekend, but what is clear is that unlike Saddam or Moammar Gadhafi, we're never going to be able to find out. 

Now you think to yourself in a democracy, you should know what the head of state is, right? Don't you have a right if you're a voter, shouldn't Canadians have a right to know where he is? Yeah, but it doesn't matter because Justin Trudeau can hide anywhere. He's a master of disguise. Any place in the world Justin Trudeau could blend in, and you'd never know it was him. 

And to prove it, we have a series of photographs. All of them are real, and all of them depict the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. You can see him looking very much not like a French Canadian, looking pretty dark, actually. This is an Arabian Nights-themed gathering when he was a high school teacher. Oh, he's got Black face on. Interesting. You can also see him blending in convincingly as a Bollywood star in India. Hands grasp together in reverence and prayer. Or, you can see him flanked by his new countrymen, they have no idea they're in the presence of a Canadian politician. That's how convincing Justin Trudeau is when he decides to play dress-up. They think he's one of them. I love samosas, Justin says. We do, too, say the Indians. They have no idea they're talking to a Canadian. But when he's not fooling people in India, he's fooling Native Americans. And yes, there is a difference bigot. Not all Indians are the same. Justin Trudeau wore the traditional headdress of one of Canada's many indigenous tribes, like the Aztecs, Justin Trudeau will rip your heart out, ladies. And, is that Clark Kent of Superman fame? No, once again, is just Justin Trudeau. 

He can impersonate fictional characters. You can see him looking like a stranded pilot in the desert from one of the Star Wars movies. He could literally be hiding on a soundstage in Hollywood as we speak. He can even be on a ranch. Unbelievable. As long as no one hands him a gun or asked him where food comes from, that's a convincing rancher right there. So, yes, Justin Trudeau can change far more than his skin color. If you see that man in any of his various disguises, do not approach him. He might be hiding in a nondescript cabin in the middle of nowhere, but he's very much in control of Ottawa, at least for the moment.

594	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democracy-functioning	2022-02-02 00:35:00	Tucker Carlson: Our democracy is no longer functioning properly, here's proof | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host examines why the left thinks democracy is in peril.

Here's something we've noticed you may have noticed it too. All of a sudden, pretty much every powerful person in the country is talking about something called democracy. Democracy, our sacred democracy. You hear that word everywhere, from the Atlantic to NPR to the New Yorker magazine and NBC News in between. Democracy defines the year 2022 the way that groovy defined 1968. All the cool kids are saying it. 

 has decided her life's mission is now to defend democracy. Jim Acosta has a new  show in which he uses the word democracy the way some people use prepositions - in every sentence. Tomorrow, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, there's a Zoom webinar on Democracy, which you're welcome to attend, in case you haven't heard enough about it already. Every left-of-center midwit on  will be there. All of them will be fretting about the future of democracy. Pretty amusing. 

It's easy to make fun of an event like that. And of course, you have a moral obligation to. David Frum bloviating about democracy. Insert joke here. But actually, if we're being honest about it, you should be a little worried about the state of our democracy, how is our democracy doing? 

Well, let's see: Another way to describe democracy is popular representation. It's a synonym. When the government does what citizens want it to do, you have a democracy. And when it doesn't, you don't. You no longer have a free country that is ruled by its people. 

So what kind of system do we have? It's easy to know. You find out what citizens care about and then you compare those concerns to what the people who run the government say they care about. If you've got a functioning democracy, there should be a fairly precise overlap. In a democratic system, leaders try very hard to speak for their voters. That's the whole point of the government. 

So let's apply that test to the United States of America. What do our leaders care about? We know the answer because they tell us constantly. Our leaders care about equity and . They care about trans rights, police brutality, the deadly insurrection on January 6th, mandatory vaccinations, more H1B visas for Indian tech workers and above all, at the moment, defending our closest ally, Ukraine, from Russian aggression. And of course, they care about third-wave academic feminism. That's deeply important to them. 

The most famous  in  gave us an impromptu tutorial in Instagram about the connection between cosmetics and the patriarchy. 

Give that lady an MSNBC show. Sorry, Mika. I wear makeup because I'm oppressed. Me, me, me, me, me. Now the shorthand description of that is narcissism, which in the end is the defining concern of our leaders. Above all, they're interested in themselves. 

If you work in the media or have multiple college degrees, chances are you're pretty good at making it all about you. You is what you care about most. What does the rest of America care about? Once again, we don't have to guess about that. We've got a huge amount of public opinion polling on that subject. 

At the top of the list, you'll see government incompetence, the economy, the cost of living and immigration. Well, that's weird. It is completely different from the list Joe Biden might have made. Equity, climate change, transgenderism mandatory vaccination, Jan. 6, Ukraine. Those trends be pretty unimportant to most Americans. Some of those issues or at the very bottom of the list. 

But how can that be? If global climate change is the most imminent existential crisis of our time, then why don't voters seem concerned about it? We don't know, but they're definitely not concerned about it. Instead, Americans are very worried about inflation and crime. As it happens, and this tells you everything, those are the two topics the  has dismissed recently as irrelevant and dumb. The White House isn't at all worried about inflation and crime. 

Hmm, that doesn't sound like democracy. Here's the White House press secretary taking some time off from her junior year in Oberlin to speak to her fellow undergrads at something called Pod Save America about how rising crime rates are actually an invention of those racists at Fox News.

So what do your kids getting shot have to do with Ukraine? Nothing, Dumbo. You're living in an alternate universe. That's Jen Psaki position. You have to be delusional to think crime was a problem in this country, unless you happen to be in Georgetown last night, around 6:45 p.m. 

If you were there, you may have seen a man shot to death outside Georgetown cupcakes. That's just off M Street. And the funny thing is, that's not too far from where Jen Psaki lives. But did Jen Psaki acknowledge that happened? Of course, she didn't. Noticing the collapse of our civilization is racist, even when it's happening just down the street. Look away, Jen Psaki. Look away. 

And whatever you do, don't go to Baltimore. Baltimore is a major American city. It's only about 40 miles from where Jen Psaki lives. It's one of the worst places in the western hemisphere. It's a little bit of Haiti in the mid-Atlantic. Baltimore is exactly what happens when you appliy Jen Psaki's ideas to governing. Baltimore is a city run by people who fervently believe in the equity agenda and consider gender studies a legitimate academic discipline. In Baltimore, pretty much everyone in charge is Black, yet it's a matter of religious faith that the main thing holding the city back is White racism. 

In other words, everybody with power in Baltimore agrees with Jen Psaki. So it's an entirely fair question to ask Hey, Jen Psaki, what do you think of Baltimore? How did the city get that way? You claim to care so deeply about African-Americans. You never stop talking about that. And yet here is one of the biggest Black majority cities in the United States. Tens of thousands of black people who live in Baltimore are in misery because their kids keep getting murdered. Last year, Baltimore's murder rate was higher than it is in El Salvador and Honduras. Now those are countries the State Department tells us to ""avoid due to crime."" 

So it's fair to say things are incredibly violent in Baltimore. They have been for a long time. And yet under Joe Biden, somehow they've gotten even worse in Baltimore. Here's a local news report from today. 

Thirtysix murders in thirty-one days, that's the deadliest January in Baltimore in nearly 50 years and remember, fifty years ago, Baltimore was almost twice as big as it is now. Half the city is left. So Baltimore is far worse off than it has ever been in its history. And it's not just murders. Drug crimes are up dramatically. You might not know that because they're not being prosecuted anymore. Last spring, the local city attorney and George Soros puppet called Marilyn Mosby announced she would no longer prosecute low level drug crimes. So arrests plummeted, but drug trafficking exploded. Here's what it looks like:

Jen Psaki's for that, Black people don't want laws to be enforced. That's her view, that's the view of everyone she knows. But what did policies like that do the Baltimore? Well, they turned a once beautiful city into a slum. According to a report by Fox 45 in Baltimore, public school administrators have instructed the police to stop arresting students for committing crimes. And that would include serious offenses from burglary to assault. So the cops did stop arresting kids. The number of students arrested in Baltimore schools has dropped by 98% in the last decade. That's good on paper. 

But it turns out ignoring crime is not the same as stopping crime. Schools in Baltimore got so bad that kids stopped learning anything. Watch this report and ask yourself: What is Baltimore going to look like in 20 years? 

So, the kids can't read, they're illiterate, what is their future look like? What does Baltimore's future look like? What does the country's future look like? How are they going to participate in our society? 

You wouldn't know any of this was happening by looking at the official graduation numbers, because last year Baltimore announced that students will graduate from high school even if they failed their courses. 

Baltimore’s so-called chief academic officer - that would be Harvard educated bureaucrat called Joan Dabrowski - announced that this policy was designed to quote Avoid the punitive approach of failing students. OK. But somebody is failing students in Baltimore. Somebody, in fact, is failing the entire city, and you have to ask yourself, who would that be? 

You'd like to ask Jen Psaki, Who do you blame for Baltimore? Did White men do this to Baltimore? Was it the patriarchy? Was it structural racism that caused all those murders? Do you agree with Pete Buttigieg that Klansman urban planners put the highways in the wrong place? And that's the real problem. Racist roads?

Or, could it be that the real problem with Baltimore is something much more obvious? Could it be that progressive policies designed to ""lift up marginalized communities"" in the end destroyed those communities? What's the answer, Jen Psaki? 

In a functioning democracy, people like Jen Psaki would have to tell us the answer, they would be required to live in Baltimore until they learn something, just as the people who wrecked Afghanistan probably ought to explain what they've learned before they move on to Ukraine and Russia, that ought to be a requirement. 

And in fact, honestly, you'd think that people like this would welcome a chance to reflect on what they've done. They have screwed up very badly. They've hurt the weakest among us. For Christians, that's the greatest sin. But these people aren't Christians. They worship only themselves, so they turn away. 

You can bet money that Jen Psaki rarely goes to Baltimore, it's just too depressing. And it raises too many questions. Instead, Jen Psaki and her friends are planning their fun little summer trips to Bozeman or Martha's Vineyard or East Hampton, or some of the remote and blindingly White outpost of privilege. 

Funny how that works. You wreck stuff and then you ignore it. This allows you to wreck more stuff without feeling guilty. That's modern progressivism distilled to 18 words.

595	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-government-podcast-censorship-joe-rogan-coronavirus	2022-02-02 23:08:00	Tucker Carlson: You’re not allowed to use government power to shut down people who criticize you | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host discusses the ‘political pressure’ surrounding Joe Rogan, Spotify controversy. 

Joe Rogan may be the most popular broadcaster in the English-speaking world right now. Every episode of his podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" reaches about 11 million people, and some of the episodes get an audience many times that. How many people is that? It's a lot. 

For perspective, last night, CNN's highest-rated show had a little over 700,000 viewers total. So Joe Rogan is big, and unlike CNN, he's not especially . His show covers pretty much everything: , science, nutrition, the paranormal, recreational drug use, exercise, mixed martial arts, music,  and a huge range of other topics, often with guests you've never heard of. 

Rogan is not a reactionary, unlike most people in the , he doesn't think he already knows everything. He's genuinely curious, and so he lets his guests speak. His longest interview lasted for more than five hours with a standup comedian. When Rogan does talk about politics, it's pretty clear he's not an ideologue. He interviews everybody. Liberals and conservatives, as well as a lot of people like Mike Tyson, who could be either one. And he does it most of the time with respect and self-deprecation. 

He's not an expert on politics. He's not pretending to be one. Rogan just asks questions, and he notes the obvious. It's this last quality that makes the people in charge hate and fear Joe Rogan. If you're trying to sell an absurd, obviously untrue idea, it is possible that Joe Rogan is going to call you on it. Not because he's a partisan, he's not. But because he just can't help but notice. That's his secret. A few months ago, Rogan watched the White House press secretary lie about the FDA's approval process for Pfizer's  vaccine. So he said something about it. Watch.  

ROGAN: 

Yeah. What he said was true. Rogan's pretty literal, actually. It's one of the reasons people trust him. And he was right in this case. Jen Psaki was lying to the country, and it wasn't even an especially clever lie. Anyone with internet access could have verified that what Jen Psaki said was a total crock, from the podium, too. But when Joe Rogan points this out, it really stings. A lot of the people listening to him believe him. And the  took notice. So what happened next? Well, here's Jen Psaki from yesterday calling on Joe Rogan's employer to censor him. Watch. 

PSAKI: 

There's more that can be done? Hey, you little fascist, that's a threat. That's exactly what it is. Politicians and their spokes chicks didn't use to talk this way. They were not allowed to talk this way because the First Amendment explicitly prohibits it. You're not allowed to use government power to shut down broadcasters who criticize you. Period. And now that's exactly what they're trying to do. 

So far, Joe Rogan's employer, Spotify, hasn't caved to the pressure. Rogan still has a job, but the company is bending. It's deleted more than 20,000 COVID-related podcast episodes made by other Spotify hosts. Spotify claims they ""cause harm."" How exactly can a podcast cause harm? Spotify didn't explain, because, of course, they couldn't explain. 

Podcasts don't cause harm, weapons cause harm. Anyone who knows anything about American business right now understood what's actually going on. In a moment like this, it is virtually impossible to run a public company, no matter how hard you try. It's not just in podcasting, it's not just Spotify. It's any company with shareholders; from breakfast cereal manufacturers to tennis shoe retailers. The political pressure is coming at these companies from all sides; from activist investors, from the media, from their own employees. Every day is a brand-new crisis. Imagine the emails between the CEO and the PR department. They never stop. And under those circumstances, it's impossible to think clearly, to stand on principle, or even to consider your own best interests long-term. That's what's going on with Spotify. They probably don't want to censor anybody. They're being pushed to. In their case, pressure to censor Joe Rogan over his views is coming from other content providers on the site, and most of them are D-listers, you should know. 

The other day, that annoying fake duchess from L.A. and her brain-dead husband threatened to walk if Spotify refused to muzzle Joe Rogan. ""Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day,"" they yelped through a publicist. But of course, they don't mean that, they're not going anywhere. These two grifters have a $25 million podcast deal with Spotify for essentially no work. So far, we believe they produced just over 30 minutes of content. That means these two have been paid about a million dollars for each minute of talking they've done. That's a good gig. It's too good to leave. But their performance does raise the question, what exactly about Joe Rogan's podcast has caused ""serious harm?"" We're literal, too. So we scoured his archives to find out. And it turns out, as usual, the opposite is true. Joe Rogan is actually a force for safety in this world. Watch this clip in which he warns the public about the dangers of approaching gorillas in the wild. It turns out, sneaking up on a gorilla, as Joe Rogan pointed out, could lead to actual serious harm.  

ROGAN: 

He's interested in animals, by the way, and he's curious, that's part of the allure. People in the media are paid to be curious, to ask questions, to wonder about other people. None of them do. They just want to lecture you. This guy actually is interested. But no one who is criticizing him seems to know that, doesn't seem like they have actually listened to his show. Neil Young probably never has. Neil Young is an elderly folk singer from the nation of . Young is already pulled his music from Spotify in protest of Rogan's open-mindedness. Does Neil Young actually own his own music? We don't know. But we know that the gesture received widespread applause from the usual morons who then revealed themselves to be even dumber than you thought they were. Variety Magazine, for example, which still exists, informed us that Neil Young stands against Joe Rogan, makes him ""a hero"" to the younger generations. Right. Because if there's one person kids of today revere, worship like a god, it's 76-year-old Neil Young. They take Neil Young over Joe Rogan any day because young people everywhere are anxious to side with the Biden administration and demand the firing of any podcast or interviews Kamala Harris disagrees with. It's hilarious. They're more out-of-touch than Neil Young is. But at CNN, they've convinced themselves it's all totally true because Joe Rogan is peddling misinformation. Therefore, he must be stopped. 

BRIAN STELTER: 

People are trusting Joe Rogan over eunuchs — can you imagine? Damn the people. They should be watching CNN. CNN has departments and desks and entire operations designed to verify information and filter out misinformation. And that's why they described Ivermectin, which in Joe Rogan's case was prescribed by a human doctor as ""horse de-wormer"" and did on like nine different shows. And those same standards led them to suggest, famously, that a passenger jet must have been sucked into a black hole. 

DON LEMON: 

We can't get enough. Yes, that clip was from eight years ago, but we watch it every single morning, along with our pilates and sauna just to get ready for the day. And if you want to watch a lot more like that, CNN has just announced you can subscribe to CNN+, and Don Lemon will be on there constantly, for a small extra fee. So that's their answer to Joe Rogan: more nonsense but the lowest-rated dummies in the entire TV business. Joe Rogan, meanwhile, consistently turns out interesting, informative programing just by being curious, just by asking obvious questions. That's all it takes. Care about what other people are saying. Watch the world around you. Take an interest in something beyond yourself. And when he does that, they don't like it. Watch this exchange with Dr. Robert Malone, who is one of the inventors of mRNA technology.

DR. MALONE: 

That was the interview that pushed CNN completely over the edge, not because it was false, but because it was entirely credible. ""Hypnotizing the public?"" ""That's our job"", they said. ""Mass formation psychosis?"" ""Yeah, that's us."" So of course, they immediately set about encouraging the tech platforms to ban that interview. Dr. Malone, again, one of the inventors of mRNA technology, being used in over a billion doses of vaccine, currently in people's bodies, that's the man who was talking. Credible? Yeah, no one more credible than that. And that's exactly why they hated it. That's exactly what they said you couldn't hear it. Now that same month, it was justthis  past December, Rogan spoke to a doctor called Peter McCullough about Ivermectin. Watch 

MCCULLOUGH: 

So those are facts. And if you think they're wrong, tell us how they're wrong. But why shouldn't people hear that? Why shouldn't they be allowed to? Well, because Dr. Peter McCullough, who certainly has the credentials to do it, criticize the people in charge. He mocks CNN for ignoring dozens of clinical trials, making fun of a drug that could have helped a lot of people, possibly saved lives. What do you think of that? Well, that's immoral, of course. 

But notice what Joe Rogan didn't do in the face of that information. He didn't call for CNN to be censored because they spread disinformation. He didn't say we have to pull CNN off the air, they're killing people. Because he's not for censorship. You know who is for censorship? Weak people are for censorship. I can't handle what you're throwing at me — shut up or else. That's exactly what they're saying. Strong people don't behave that way. Only the weak. Everybody knows that. They can smell it. And the reason Joe Rogan is successful? Because he's not weak. That's the truth.

596	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mask-mandates-power-science	2022-02-03 22:57:00	Tucker Carlson: Mask mandates are a debate about power, not about science | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues leaders are using mask mandates to ‘manipulate’ people for power.

You may remember that Glenn Youngkin became governor of  last month. Youngkin was elected in part because he promised to let parents decide whether or not their kids wear masks in school. Voters wanted that. So true to his word, almost immediately after he was sworn in, Youngkin banned mask mandates in school. No one was surprised by this, obviously. Again, he ran on it. That's how democracy is supposed to work. Voters want something, they asked for it, then they elect someone to do it, and then that person does it. 

So in Virginia, our system functioned perfectly, our democratic system. But there are still people in the state of Virginia who don't believe in democracy, and they're not QAnon people, by the way, they're members of the . They have no interest in what voters think, they have contempt for election results. They do what they want. And it turns out a lot of these people are now running the public  in Virginia. And, because they don't care about the law or election outcomes, they've refused to lift the mask mandates for children. So Gov. Youngkin pushed back against this, of course, and the standoff wound up in court. 

Yesterday, the judge in that case, Louise diMatteo, made a highly revealing statement: ""I'm not going to decide who's right and who's wrong on masking,"" she said. ""This is really about the hierarchy of authority."" Well, exactly. That really is what it's about. After more than two years of  restrictions, there's not a huge amount of scientific debate over masks on children. Masks don't appear to work. They don't appear to protect children. We do know they hurt children profoundly. 

So at this point, the only debate left, as the judge pointed out, is not to debate over science. It's a debate about power. And here are the parameters: Who's in charge of your children? Is it you, the parent, or is it the teachers' unions? Who runs your country? Is it you, the voters, or is it unelected bureaucrats? Are they really in charge? So, to be clear, this isn't really about masks. Those are the questions we're debating at this point. 

Janet Davidson has already made up her mind about these questions. Davidson is an assistant principal at an elementary school in Loudoun County, Virginia. Here, she threatens to have children arrested if they dare to show up to class without a mask.

So you have to ask, how could someone like that wind up running an elementary school? Wouldn't that be the last person you'd want to hand your kids over to every morning? Well, sure. And to be clear, trespassing, the crime that she cites, is in Virginia Class 1 misdemeanor. If you trespass, you can get a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. And that's exactly what she is threatening kids with if they show up without masks at school. So in Loudoun County, you can sexually assault someone in a bathroom, the school will cover for you. But if you show up without a mask, you face a year in jail. 

And it's not just Virginia, by the way, this is happening all over the country, according to a service that tracks mask policies and school districts across America. More than 60% of the 500 districts it monitors still require masks. 

In West Islip, , for example, the Oquenock Elementary School sent letters to parents recently explaining their children will be considered truant if they dare to show up to school without a mask. Now in the state of New York, the parents of truant students can receive fines and prison terms. This show obtained a letter from Oquenock, the elementary school, to the parents of a very young child enrolled there. ""For the last week, your child has arrived at school but refused to wear a mask, and therefore has not been permitted to attend class or participate in other school activities,"" reads the letter. ""Your child will no longer be able to attend school unless they wear a mask...If your child does not return to school, they will be considered truant."" 

Oh, so the child is punished either way. What you notice is that nowhere in the letter is there any  justification for these rules because, of course, there isn't one, it doesn't exist. There is a consensus now among serious people that mask mandates for children do not protect children or adults. And to be clear, that's not a right-wing opinion. The Atlantic Magazine, whose default setting for two full years has been screaming COVID hysteria, just published a piece entitled ""The Case Against Masks at School."" The piece notes mask ""provide little discernible benefit,"" and it's not just the Atlantic. Today, a team of scientists and virologists published an op-ed in USA Today. Their conclusion? ""With vaccines available mask mandates are not necessary in school,"" period. They went on to explain, ""even in unvaccinated children, rates of serious disease from COVID-19 are similar to that of the seasonal flu, and we do not normally take exceptional precautions in schools for the flu, for which we do not normally implement school mask mandates."" 

You knew that, but they're finally admitting it. Now they reviewed the data on school and masking and ""find that well-controlled real-world studies consistently failed to find a convincing benefit, while studies cited to support masking have serious flaws."" Once again, we've been telling you this for a year and a half. And now it's completely confirmed. There doesn't seem to be a debate about it. 

Masks don't benefit children. They actively harm children. Child development experts are weighing in and saying, oh yes, long-term use of masks on children can inflict profound cognitive damage. Again, you could have guessed this. Now it's confirmed. One therapist, for example, in Palm Beach, Florida, says her clinic has seen a 364% increase in referrals of babies and toddlers. Why? Masks. 

Everything about this is shocking. But what's most shocking of all is that we are virtually alone in doing this. In other countries in the civilized world, the UK, Norway, many others, kids are not required to wear masks in school because they don't work, and they hurt kids. This is not a mystery. It's not a secret. School officials know this, there's no logic or data to support their position. So when you don't have evidence or a legitimate justification, you move very quickly to indoctrination. You lie because you have no choice. Here's an assistant superintendent for Wake County Public Schools, that would be in North Carolina, areep called Paul Koh. He explains on video his plan to reprogram children so they obey him without question. 

Okay, so there's no reason to have a country in which our children are, ""educated by people like that,"" in which you're required by law to hand your kids over to people like that. People who are clearly psychologically damaged, who have agendas that have nothing to do with education, and are, in fact, sinister. Why are they doing this? Well, of course, because long term, this is how you maintain power. If you've got nothing to convince people with, you manipulate them. You weaken the young people, you degrade their mental health. That's how you maintain control. Take a look at these pictures from Oxford Middle School in the state of . You can see students in a band playing instruments with masks over their faces. But even more ridiculous, the instruments themselves have masks. Now, it's easy to laugh at this, but it's also horrifying. Think about the brainwashing required to do this with a straight face. 

By the way, the lunacy extends to adults. In Broward County, , a free state most of the time, anyone who wants to check out a book from the library must have a mask on. So, comply or you're not allowed to read. Now, some people have medical exemptions where they don't have to wear a mask, they have COPD, for example. If you have a medical exemption, you don't get to read as many books. You have to make do with a much smaller selection of reading material. 

Yeah, let's put kids on Zoom class for two years and prevent adults from reading books unless they obey. Pretty hard to justify any of this in terms a logical person would understand. So they're not even bothering, the people enforcing these rules aren't arguing on their behalf. They're just laughing at you and making you do it. Here's an example from Los Angeles; the mayor of that city, the second-biggest city in this country, , explains that he wasn't wearing a mask when he took an indoor photograph with Magic Johnson, someone who's technically immunocompromised, but whatever. Here's his his explanation.

I held my breath. I did not inhale. Notice he doesn't blush when he says that, he just says it and expects you to believe it. That's a totally adequate explanation. Can I get away with it? I didn't breathe. Therefore, it's fine. Try that on a commercial airline flight.  did the same. He also took a maskless photograph with Magic Johnson. By the way, for the record, that's fine. But these are the people who are telling you it's a crime. So when they're caught doing it, what's their excuse? Well, in the case of the governor of California, he says he had the mask in his hand, so he was safe.

Not actually encouraging everyone else to do this. More like requiring everyone else to do so. That and a whole lot of other things that have no scientific justification. But as long as you have a mask in your left hand, and you happen to be the governor of California and you make the rules, you don't have to obey the rules. That's how it works. So again, these explanations are getting more transparent, more absurd. And that should make you a little worried because when people stop explaining things, or trying to justify them, or try to win you over their position, what do they have left to make you comply? Force. That's it. They just have force.

597	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-ukraine-policies-washington-priorities	2022-02-05 00:01:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden's Ukraine policies reveal how grotesque Washington's priorities are | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host examines White House claims of a potential Russian false flag operation.

There aren’t a lot of amazing stories left in ""The New York Times,"" they are all so predictable and self-righteous, but if you read the paper yesterday you did see one. ""U.S. Exposes What It Says Is Russian Effort to Fabricate Pretext for Invasion."" That was the headline. The story explained that at some point very soon, Vladimir Putin plans to stage a fake military attack on his own citizens. Putin will use actors to portray Ukrainian soldiers and Intel operatives committing atrocities against Russians. Then he’s going to videotape the whole thing and secretly release to the world. When people in the West see the clips of that on Facebook they will understand why Putin was justified in invading Ukraine. So it's a Psyop. Pretty diabolical. 

You may be wondering how exactly how do we know that Vladimir Putin is actually planning to do something like this. Because in real life, the global intelligence world is a very complicated place. People in it rarely tell straightforward truths. So actually,  if you are devising propaganda for the Ukrainian government, this might be exactly the kind of story you would place in ""The New York Times,"" which of course is compliant. They're on your side. A story like this would give you a way to plausibly deny attacking Russian citizens. 

Is that what happened here? We don’t know. We have no idea if ""The New York Times"" account is true or not. Then again, neither does ""The New York Times."" Right in a story, they conceded that the Biden officials ""would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or specify how they learned of it,"" saying to do so would ""compromise their sources and methods."" Those must be the same sources and methods the CIA is protecting by continuing to hide thousands of documents from 911 two decades ago, or the Kennedy assassination 60 years ago. If you live in Washington you recognize that that is the all-purpose justification for everything. State Department spokesman Ned price knows exactly how this works because Price began his career at the CIA. 

Here's what he said at a briefing: 

Wait a second, what was that? A false flag operation? Really? That is a jarring term to hear from a Joe Biden employee much less an official. Because until yesterday we were under the impression false flag operations didn’t exist. And if they did exist it was only within the diseased imagination of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and his minions in QAnon. That’s what they told us. 

But now they are telling us that false flag operations are entirely real, except they never happen here. Never in the United States, never in Washington, only in Russia. We will let that digest just for a minute. CIA veteran Ned Price assures us that it is true. Normally that would be the end of it. Reporters would’ve scurried back to the cubicles to write their breathless little stories about Vladimir Putin's false flag operation. And by and large that is exactly what did happen. The stenographers wrote Ned Price’s story. 

But one of them didn’t. That man’s name is Matt Lee. He’s a State Department reporter for the Associated Press. We know nothing about Matt Lee other than he appears to be a middle-aged man who has been around long enough to ask a skeptical follow-up question or two. In Washington that makes them virtually unique. Lee noticed that Ned Price actually hadn’t said anything that could be checked or even described in meaningful detail. So Lee asked Ned Price, ""What are you actually talking about?"" Here's the exchange that followed. 

Hold on a second. What are you talking about? That was the question. It was a good question. You wish you heard it more in official briefings, you wish you heard it more in everyday life in this country. It is usually the essential question in the first step towards finding out what the truth is. Ned Price didn’t want to answer that question, but Lee kept pressing him. Why didn’t Matt Lee just take Ned Price’s word for it like everybody else? Maybe because this is the very same Ned Price who has a documented history of lying to reporters in the briefing room. Here is Ned Price promising that Kabul would not fall to the Taliban not long before it did fall to the Taliban:

""Our partnership will not diminish in any way with the military withdrawal from Afghanistan."" Days after Ned Price said that, the Biden back president of Afghanistan through millions of U.S. dollars into a duffel bag and fled to the United Aram Emirates in a private plane. So actually, the partnership did diminish, pretty quickly in fact. Matt Lee has been around long enough to remember that. He probably also remembers the time Colin Powell promised the country there were WMDs in Iraq. He probably remembers when Hillary Clinton claimed our ambassador in Benghazi was murdered over an Islamic-phobic YouTube video. He probably remembers those two separate occasions, not too long ago, when the entire foreign policy establishment in Washington assured us that evil Bashar al-Assad had gassed his own people with poison gas and deserved to be bombed, but at the same time forgot to show us any evidence that it actually happened. We are still waiting on that evidence, by the way. Matt Lee remembers stuff like that and he mentioned it yesterday.

Best question ever: ""Where’s the declassified information other than you coming out here and saying it?"" How thrilling to watch someone ask something so simple. Imagine if the entire press corps acted like that? We might have a decent government.Ned Price seemed completely unprepared for any of this and highly annoyed by it. Nothing in his CIA training had suggested he might encounter disobedient reporters in the White House. So he stuck with what he had which was, ""I said it, therefore it’s true.""

It went on and on like this. If you really want to dislike your government, you can look it up for yourself online. We can tell you Ned Price’s superciliousness gets more nauseating as it goes on. It does make you wonder about the CIA. Do they hire people oily on this purpose? Where do they find people like this? Well, The Georgetown School of Foreign Service, of course. We tell you just one more portion of this exchange in which Matt Lee flips the usual script and accuses Ned Price of sounding like a crazed conspiracy nut. It’s beautiful. 

. 

One correction, Alex Jones lies far less and is far more credible than Ned Price is. You see the point. Ned Price lost that exchange. He claimed to have information that he did not have, and Matt Lee persistently called him out on it. So Ned Price ran out of B.S. The B.S. barrel was empty. So what did Ned Price do then? Ned Price did what they all do when they are cornered. He went right to the lowest personal attack. He didn’t call Matt Lee racist, he’s probably saving that for next week, but he did suggest Matt Lee is more sympathetic to Russia than he is to his own country, the United States. He implied Matt Lee is a shill for Vladimir Putin. 

At an earlier age, this is the point where Matt Lee would’ve gone to the podium and punched him right in the face. There was a time in this country when calling a man disloyal was a grave and serious charge. You could not let that stand. That’s not true anymore, we’re so used to it now. We hear it constantly. On Wednesday, two days ago, during a closed-door briefing in Congress on Russia, Jim Cooper of Tennessee, a Democrat, asked an intelligence briefer to find out if this show is tied to Russia. 

We are not tied to Russia, of course. It’s a cable television program. We are not a diplomatic mission. Jim Cooper knows that. But that is not the point. The point is: We have criticized the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy. So in retaliation for that, Jim Cooper has asked the intel agencies to dig up dirt on us. To be clear, that is not allowed. It is illegal to use the U.S. Government to settle partisan scores or to silence opposition journalists. 

It is also, by the way, illegal to secretly monitor their electronic communications. But Joe Biden’s NSA did that to this show this summer. That happened. We are not speculating about it. The NSA admitted it. And congressman Cooper admitted what he did today when we asked him, though he was too cowardly to come on tonight to explain how he could justify that. 

This is scary behavior. It is also revealing. 

After a full year of governing, all the Biden Administration could muster when challenged are ad hominem attacks and more spying from the intel agents. Let’s put the intel agencies on. What they can’t do is explain themselves. They don’t even try. That is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of rot, it’s a sign of weakness. And yet they are doing it and getting away with it. How are they getting away with it? Very simple, they are getting away with it because Republicans are allowing them to get away with it. 

Screaming about Russia, even as we ignore China, is now a bipartisan effort. You remember Russia-gate. You thought Republicans would never fall for that again? No, they internalize the whole thing. They now believe Russia is our greatest enemy. They are the existential threat. All eyes on Putin. They could stop this tomorrow. If Mitch McConnell criticized the build-up to the war with Putin, it would end immediately. If five Republicans held a press conference tomorrow to declare that the territorial integrity of the United States is more important than the territorial integrity of Ukraine, this couldn’t continue. The lunacy would end. But they are not doing that. Instead, Republicans are every bit as hysterical about Russia as Adam Schiff ever was. 

Lindsey Graham just admits I’m on Biden’s inside, but most of them are too clever to do that. They are doing something you may not notice at first. They are attacking Joe Biden for being weak. His weaknesses is inviting aggression. And on the basis of that, they are in fact agreeing with Biden and supporting his Russia policy. Got that? We are against Biden. That is why we are backing him up and his Russian policy. Pretty clever. 

Is that what Republican voters want? Let’s see. If you ask them, they probably say why don’t we send as much military equipment to the Texas border as we did to the Russian border? If someone says it out loud, that may be the entire country could assess how grotesque Washington’s priorities are. Speaking of grotesque priorities, Senator John Cornyn represents Texas. Texas is a state that’s had well over 1 million foreign nationals pour into it illegally over the last year. Right over the border. That is a far bigger invasion than anything Vladimir Putin is planning in Ukraine. And yet when John Cornyn talks about border security, he’s not talking about his own state or even his own country. He’s talking about Ukrainian border security. 

These are people who sit in committee meetings often with closed doors. What are they doing? Well they are apparently sicking the intel agencies on anyone who criticizes them. But are they getting unfiltered information from those intel agencies? Are they making wise decisions on the basis of it? Do have any idea what they are talking about? No, of course not. They cloak their ignorance in the usual cliches. Freedom-loging democracies like Ukraine. But the truth is, their interests, their beliefs are so far out of alignment with the interests and beliefs of the average person in this country, including their own voters, that once that is exposed to light, they are in trouble. 

Last point, this is only happening because there is no credible opposition to it in the Congress.

598	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-how-long-before-protests-like-this-come-here	2022-02-07 23:31:00	Tucker Carlson: How long before protests like the 'Freedom Convoy' come to America? | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues leaders are trying to intimidate truckers for speaking out. 

Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains. That's from Karl Marx, of course. He wrote that famous phrase in 1848. The weird thing is, it's pretty likely that Marx himself never met an actual worker.  

Wait a second. He didn't spend a decade in a cotton mill, witnessing the oppression firsthand. No. Karl Marx never spent a moment in a factory. He was a rich kid who became a journalist. Of course he was. But for more than 150 years, Karl Marx inspired generations of other rich kids who also became journalists to repeat his line or variations of it.  

Over time, workers became working men or working class and then with feminism, working people or working families, but the idea itself never changed. Ordinary people, wage earners, are getting shafted, so they've got to unite. They've got to come together for protection and for dignity. This was the idea, of course, behind the organized labor movement, and every Democratic president from Andrew Jackson until now has made the very same point over and over again. ""The noble people of Scranton..."" You hear it even today. So, Democrats have repeated that line often enough. You would think they really mean it. 

Do they really mean it? Let's take the test. Here's how you know. Watch what happens when actual workers, working people from working families who constitute the working class, actually come together as a group to protest how things are going.  

What happens then? Does the intellectual class greet these workers as heroes? Throw a parade? Listen intently to their stories? Does NPR do a sympathetic feature on them? Or, do self-described progressives recoil in revulsion and horror at the grubbiness of the people who as we used to say, work for a living? Do liberals immediately denounce them as Nazis and call for their suppression by force? That's the question. What's the answer? We'll ask  voters what happens. They'll know.

Or consider what's happening right now in Canada. Thousands of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa, the capital city, to protest the tyranny of Justin Trudeau's government. Justin Trudeau does not like truck drivers. He thinks they're revolting. Justin Trudeau likes private equity barons and tech moguls, the only people who give him money. Trudeau is not in Ottawa right now. In fact, he and his family fled when the truck drivers arrived and they've been in hiding ever since. So when the revolution he has been calling for finally arrived, Justin Trudeau wasn't there to see it. He ran away in terror, kind of sad. 

 So instead, in his place, his friend Mark Carney has been speaking for him. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive who many believe will replace Justin Trudeau if Trudeau ever decides to give up power. In a recent op-ed, Mark Carney vented his rage at the impudent truckers in Ottawa and anyone who sent them money on the internet.  

""Anyone sending money to the convoy should be in no doubt,"" Carney wrote. ""You are funding sedition. Foreign funders of an insurrection interfered in our domestic affairs from the start.""  

Got it? That is not a protest. It's sedition. It's an insurrection. Clearly, Mark Carney's been watching a lot of CNN up there in Canada and that's why he's concluded the truckers should be crushed by force.  

""Those who are still helping to extend this occupation must be identified and punished to the full force of the law."" People who sent the money should be prosecuted. If they're not prosecuted, Mark Carney fears, ""the constant blaring of horns at all hours will bankrupt our businesses.""  

Are you laughing yet? So, the very same finance ghouls who cheered lockdowns for two solid years are now deeply concerned that small businesses might be hurt by the trucker protests. Hilarious. It'll be interesting, by the way, to pull small business owners in Ottawa to see what they think. How did they feel about the truckers? Some of you know exactly what those results would be, but no one's doing that poll, of course. Instead, they found an easier way. 

Justin Trudeau has just ordered police to shut the whole thing down. How do you do that? How do you stop a truck protest? Simple. You seize their fuel. That's exactly what police in Canada are doing. 

OK, so we are, through much practice, connoisseurs of irony. So, let's pause a moment to savor the irony here. The very same people told us we had to defund the police are now telling the police to seize fuel from working-class Canadians who are trying to stay alive in Arctic temperatures.  

As they used to say in the 1960s, ""scratch a liberal, and you will find a fascist."" That was a Black Panther slogan, actually. They weren't entirely stupid. In fact, in this case, they were absolutely right.  

According to Justin Trudeau, possessing gasoline in the city of Ottawa is now a crime. Now, to be clear, Ottawa didn't declare the state of emergency because the truckers lit a courthouse on fire or shot someone or leveled a church. BLM did all of those things, but Justin Trudeau strongly supports BLM.  

He reaffirmed to support the other day. Here's the problem. We're going to let the mayor of Ottawa explain why peaceful truck drivers pose an imminent danger to Canada. 

They've got bouncy castles for kids, growls the childless mayor of Ottawa, let's hurt them. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a dark scene in Truckistan tonight. The kids are on the bouncy castles. Of course, at the same time, their parents are flaunting the authority of the people in charge and that is the crime. One protester, a clear White supremacist, explained his motives for protest.  

Shut up, racist. Go back to Jamaica with your White supremacy nonsense. By the way, no one in Canada's government or the media in Canada, which is mostly controlled by the government, is engaging with any of the arguments of people like that. Instead, they've gone directly to force as crumbling regimes always do. They don't have an argument to make. All they have is police power and they're using them. Officials in Ottawa just threatened to criminally investigate the California company GoFundMe because truckers raised about $10 million on the platform. Here's Ottawa's police chief bragging about stealing that money: 

Intelligence operations? This is a peaceful, political protest. No one has shown any evidence to the contrary. It's not a drug trafficking or human trafficking operation. It's not . These are Canadian citizens who drive trucks for a living, but they're being treated like a terror group. GoFundMe announced it would redirect the $10 million raised by supporters of the truckers to charities of its choice, presumably BLM, which it has supported since the very beginning. In other words, GoFundMe planned to steal that money.  

They were stopped from doing this, by the way, by a number of American attorneys general who threatened to sue the companies. So the company backed off and they're going to refund the money, supposedly. But still, the truckers, the people for whom this money was intended, will not get it. So, in the absence of GoFundMe doing what it's supposed to do, others are filling the gap. An alternative crowdfunding website called Give Send Go has stepped up and raised already more than $5 million for the truckers. How long till they try to shut that down too?  

Some Canadians are clearly worried about that. They're turning to cryptocurrency. Tally Coin, for example, is a small crowdfunding service that uses Bitcoin. It's not controlled by banks. That's the point. They're hosting a fundraiser for the truckers. Now, why is this appealing? No one can steal the money. No government can pressure anyone to turn the money over because governments don't control crypto. Bitcoin goes from person A to person B and all the intermediary does, the company, is connect the two. 

 It's pretty appealing and you can imagine the long-term consequences here. If the people in charge, in this country and in Canada, want to make the U.S. dollar irrelevant, they'll keep acting like this and soon, it will be.  

Either way, it's becoming very clear that the only way around the stranglehold the technology has on our human rights is decentralization. That doesn't apply just to crowdfunding, but more than anything to communication. You can't organize if you can't talk to other people. So Facebook, for example, to shut down the ""Convoy to D.C. Group,"" which had amassed 134,000 followers in just two days. No one's allowed to promote the organization anymore. Facebook, all day today, has been suppressing positive articles about the truckers in Canada. Of course they are. That seems like a story, but our media have ignored it. Instead, everyone in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles is cheering on the national security state and its alliance with Silicon Valley as they come together to crush a human rights movement. It makes sense. 

CNN REPORTER:  

It's spreading like a contagion. Now, you knew that CNN was the praetorian guard for our ruling class. Did you know they serve the same role in Canada and what other countries? How much money to CNN take from the government of Canada? That'd be worth finding out.  

They described what's happening in Ottawa as a, ""violent and dangerous demonstration."" Really? Where's the violence coming from? The only people getting injured or have been injured so far are the protesters, the truckers.  

In Winnipeg on Friday, an anarchist called David Zegarac drove his jeep into four people who were protesting vaccine mandates. Zegarac didn't stop after hitting the people he fled. Police were legally arrested him. Of course, police are treating the incident like a hit and run. Nothing political. It's not domestic terrorism or anything. David Zegarac, his views, they agree with. He's a progressive, a true believer. How much is he a true believer?  

If you look closely, you'll notice that Zegarac has his mask on driving alone in his car during the assault, prima facie evidence of mental illness, something you see in this country all the time, and it makes you wonder: if you're driving alone with a mask on, do you pose a danger to pedestrians? Entirely possible. Someone should fund a study on that. That seems like a big story, especially since it's happening just an hour from our own border, all of this.  

The question is: How long before protests like this come here? Clearly, our media are worried about that. Watch the morning news anchors on MSNBC. They're deeply, deeply concerned about these uppity working-class people. Watch. 

So here you have Joe and Mika sneering from their studio in Florida at the freezing wage earners stuck outside in Ottawa in February because they want their human rights. Screw them! Well, Joe Scarborough say that to their faces? Probably not.  

Scarborough's famously tough on young female employees. Some say he's an absolute killer in the office, but it's hard to imagine Scarborough talking like this if there was an actual Canadian trucker in the room. Truckers in this country are watching all of this, and you wonder: what do they think about it? What would happen if American truck drivers decided they'd had enough of people like Joe Scarborough and went on strike? What would happen then? Well, this country would stop immediately, no more deliveries of anything. 

 Over time that would mean starvation for people in the cities, but even in the short term, there would be profound suffering in this country. For example, and this is something that too few people outside of television even consider, the world's entire supply of Botox is manufactured on the west coast of Ireland. That's a long way from here. In fact, it's a 4,000 mile long supply chain from the Allergan plant in Westport, Ireland to Jupiter, Florida. 

 Now, people at MSNBC might not be aware of this, but our country has no domestic Botox production, along with vitamin C and antibiotics. It's one of the lifesaving pharmaceutical products we have recklessly offshored. So if the trucks stop delivering, the Botox stops coming and suddenly your morning television anchors are going to look like they're 58 years old, which actually they are. 

Could that happen? Is it impossible? No, it's not impossible. The people in charge aren't really thinking this through. Most of the time, trends start the United States and they move north to Canada, but this time, the opposite could happen.

It'd be pretty fascinating to see the latest internal polling on  restrictions. We haven't seen it, but it must have been pretty awful, apocalyptic, because something spooked them bad. 

Over the course of less than a week, the same people who have systematically turned America into a quarantine camp suddenly, out of nowhere, started calling in unison for medical freedom. Suddenly, they sounded like Bobby Kennedy Jr., pretty much all of them. 

Even the whiny hypochondriacs at The Atlantic Magazine, those neurotic cat owners who've turned COVID hysteria into a  are now calling for a total abandonment of all Coronavirus restrictions. ""Open everything. … The time to when pandemic restrictions is now."" Believe it or not, that was the headline on The Atlantic's website today. Amazing. So if even The Atlantic has given up on coronavirus restrictions, obviously the pandemic is over. 

You should know this virus was killed, not by science, but by the . It turns out the only real cure for COVID-19 is the political ambition of the Democratic Party. That's the panacea. And by the way, that's fine. We'll take it. Yes, every upside has a downside. It means that pasty NPR listeners are going to emerge from their apartment for the first time in two years will be loose on the streets. You're going to see them at Whole Foods again, shuffling along with their tote bags, looking bewildered and annoyed. That's bad, but it's still worth it. Anything to make the insanity go away, we're celebrating. But we're also looking forward. 

And the question is, how do we guarantee that nothing like this ever happens again? How do we prevent future mass hysteria events in the ? And the answer is very simple. You restore democracy. You give Americans a voice in the policies that affect their lives. That was the system that we had for a couple of hundred years, it was a pretty good system. We ought to go back to it. 

If elected  were allowed to vote on COVID restrictions, we'd have far fewer COVID restrictions. And that's true of everything, every bad idea. If the  had to follow the Constitution and authorize our wars, we'd have fewer pointless wars. We definitely would not be moving toward war with  right now because the public doesn't support that, at all. So virtually every bad thing that has happened over the past two years, or ever, has been imposed by fiat, far outside the bounds of our constitutional democracy. In this case, governors and health authorities got emergency powers at the beginning of the pandemic. Do you remember? With those powers, they played God for two full years. In case you've forgotten what that was like, here it is:

So they went full fascist immediately, and they weren't even competent fascists. These are some of the least impressive, least skilled, least accomplished, least intelligent people in our entire country. You wouldn't hire any of them to clean your gutters, and all of a sudden they had absolute power. So it's probably not too surprising that they went into directions no one could have anticipated. No singing under COVID, no dancing, no working, definitely no exercising. We're closing the gyms, in the name of public health. In fact, we're closing the oceans. In 2020, in a moment that should never be forgotten by the sane world, authorities in the state of California arrested a paddleboarder who was exercising by himself off the Malibu pier. 

NBC 2020:  

So everything about that is kind of stunning, less than two years later, even. But maybe the creepiest part of it is how nonchalantly the NBC newsman reported it like it's totally normal to drag paddleboarders away for swimming alone. Because if cops didn't vigorously police the Pacific Ocean, seagulls could spread disease. Apparently, that was the thinking or the lack of it. 

So our , almost to a person, acted like the peasants they are, and they cheered on the strongman reflexively, because that's what peasants do. They cheer as the person oppressing them rides by on this horse. MSNBC excitedly reported on how police in New Jersey, this is very clever, used drones to spy on homeowners in their own backyards.

MSNBC: 

DRONE: 

MSNBC: 

So some robot is screaming at you as you're having a barbecue in your backyard, and MSNBC describes that as the ""lifesaving message."" Don't depend on these people to save you from tyranny. Of course, they'll be cheering it on. That very same month that MSNBC aired that unbelievable report, we decided to speak to the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy. Now, Phil Murphy is a not very bright finance hack who got rich. How do these people get rich, exactly? But in his case, thanks to the Wuhan Institute of Technology, suddenly  found himself king of the Garden State. So we asked his majesty Phil Murphy, where exactly did he get the right to suspend constitutional rights in New Jersey? And here's what he said. 

TUCKER 2020:  

MURPHY: 

""That's above my pay grade."" So King Murphy's got an IQ of about 70. How did that guy get to be governor? I mean, that's bad enough, but to give him absolute power? Let's go ahead and never do that again, under any circumstance. 

Checks and balances exist for a reason. We saw this all over the country.  and local officials abusing their authority, very specifically, to stop Christians from attending church, to prevent people from worshiping their God, from exercising their . And somehow, nobody noticed. But voters noticed. Last fall, Phil Murphy almost lost his job in New Jersey, which is axiomatically democratic, it's the most democratic state you can think of on the eastern seaboard. So Murphy seemed a little confused by this. ""My subjects don't like me, really? I had no idea."" 

So he convened a focus group. Let's hire McKinsey to find out what's going on here. Well, according to New York Times, here's what his majesty Phil Murphy found, ""Across the board, voters shared frustrations over public health measures, a sense of pessimism about the future and a deep desire to return to some sense of normalcy."" And by normalcy, of course, they meant getting Phil Murphy's boot off their necks. So Murphy, as we said, seemed a little stunned by this. But he reacted. Because in the end, these people are very simple organisms. Politicians are. They're not complex, they're not ideological. They respond to what they have to do. To blunt stimuli. 

So he recognizes the midterm elections are coming. So Phil Murphy, again, not a genius, lifted the state's mask mandates. And that's happening in a lot of different places, blue states. Governors in Connecticut, Oregon, Delaware, California, Illinois. They're all doing it. Even in , where the ""Governor"" Kathy Hochul, - that's what we call an unelected leader whom not a single voter actually voted for - she reached the same conclusion. Kathy Hochul, the ""governor"" (you know, by the way, in a lot of places, you can be arrested for impersonating a public official, she's not the governor, she was never elected by anybody, and no one's arrested her) apparently has the power to lift the state's indoor mask mandate. So she's doing that. But she shouldn't imagine this is over. They still have power. They don't want to give it up. So the Health Department in New York is trying to expand the state's quarantine powers, just in case they ever have to put you in a camp. Kathy Hochul has decided not to lift the mask mandate for schools because, of course, the teachers' unions have more swap than parents do. 

Meanwhile, the CDC still requires U.S. citizens to get a negative COVID test in order to return to their own country. So the CDC has the power to bar you from your own country? Really, where do they get that power? Anyone at the CDC elected? I don't think so. They are a bunch of incompetent public health administrators. Nor, by the way, has the Biden administration announced plans to lift the mask mandate on airplanes. Now, why would the Biden administration be in charge of that? Shouldn't Congress make that call? They're the ones who voted for that mandate. Oh, no, but they didn't. Congress never voted on that mandate. The agencies imposed it. You should know that mandate, by the way, does not apply to private jet service. Most people who fly private don't own the plane. They rent a plane from a jet company. And those companies don't have to comply with the mask mandate because Democratic donors fly on those planes, so they're exempt. The TSA, by the way, announced in August that the airline mask mandate would remain in place at least through March 18. Congress had no role in this. 

Congress voted to spend trillions of dollars on COVID relief, but nobody in the Congress ever voted on a mandate for masks on airplanes. Will we have it forever? I don't know. You've been taking your shoes off since Richard Reid tried to ignite his 20 years ago. No one ever voted on that, either. None of this is democracy. Not when they make you take your shoes off. Not when they make you cover your face. Those decisions are too important for you to weigh in on. It's not democracy. 

So the pandemic is over, but people like Kathy Hochul still have emergency powers and school boards do, too. They're acting like they have complete power over your children. In Naperville, Illinois, a court just issued a restraining order against Governor Pritzker's statewide school mask mandate. The school board? Simply ignoring it. So on Monday, parents fought back. 

They're doing to the school board what the truckers are doing to Justin Trudeau, and let's hope it has the same effect. Keep in mind they're in that meeting because the school board is ignoring a lawful court order, and of course, blowing off the parents they serve. Now the answer to all of this is really simple. Strip these reckless morons of their monarchical powers and return this country to democracy. Why is that hard?

600	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-canada-working-class-rebelled	2022-02-10 23:37:00	Tucker Carlson: Canada's working class has finally rebelled, and they are succeeding | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the Freedom Convoy protests on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

When  politicians across this country all of a sudden start to pull back their mask mandates, they did it virtually overnight and of course they did it in unison, we naturally assumed that new polling had to be behind it. 

Someone at the DNC must have seen terrifying public opinion numbers and decided to abandon ""Project Quarantine"" before the midterm elections. That made sense to us. We explain that theory on the show last night. We still think it's probably pretty true, but it's also clear as of tonight that there was another explanation for this. Democrats in this country are looking north to their friends in the ruling party of Canada and what they see there scares them.  

 working class has finally rebelled after years of relentless abuse. Truck drivers are threatening to topple Justin Trudeau's creepy little government with their big rigs, and they may succeed, actually. The protests against Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates have been far more effective than anyone in charge imagined.

For Democrats in the United States, that's a pretty obvious lesson. Over the past 48 hours, Canadian truckers have blocked the major trade routes between their country and ours. Last night, farmers driving heavy agricultural equipment shut down the highways at the Manitoba border with the United States. 

Eleven hundred miles away, a similar scene on the border of Ontario in the United States. Green tractors with Canadian flags lining the highway in protest, but the most meaningful blockade of all is taking place right now on the Ambassador Bridge. That's the privately-owned span that connects Detroit to Windsor, Ontario.

If you live in the Upper Midwest, you know it well. A quarter of all the trade between the United States and Canada, one another's biggest trading partners, that's billions of dollars, comes across that bridge and as Fox's Molly Line is reporting from Ottawa, that bridge is now completely shut down.  

  

""We want freedom,"" the truckers are saying,"" freedom from mandates."" It's a very straightforward ask, but so far the truckers don't have that freedom and so their blockade continues.  

So far, that blockade has forced the Ford Motor Company to shut down one of its manufacturing plants and to operate another plant with a skeleton crew.  

Toyota says it won't be able to manufacture vehicles in Ontario for the rest of the week. General Motors has canceled multiple shifts at its plant in Lansing, Michigan, due to part shortages. So this protest is less than a week old, and already it is causing deep pain to at least one global industry.  

It's hard to overstate the historical significance of what we're watching right here. The Canadian trucker convoy is the single most successful human rights protest in a generation. If nothing else, it has been a very useful reminder to our entitled ruling class. The working-class men can be pushed, but only so far. When they push back, it hurts. 

 It turns out that truck drivers are more important to a country's future than, say, diversity consultants or even MSNBC contributors. Who knew? The White House has no interest in knowing. According to the Associated Press, tonight, the Biden administration is, ""urging the Trudeau government"" to ""use its federal powers to stop this protest"" to end the truckers' protest. In other words, crush them by force. 

Politico was reporting that Biden officials are coordinating with Canadian authorities to, ""establish alternate traffic routes around the protesters."" That Scranton Joe, the pro-union guy shutting down a labor action. Pete Buttigieg is the completely incompetent transportation secretary in this country. Apparently, he's in charge of this effort. What Mayor Pete does not realize is it's not so easy.  

Truck drivers know a lot more about roads than McKinsey consultants do. An alternative border crossing in Alberta, for example, has already been totally shut down. They thought of that already, Mayor Pete. The Blue Water Bridge, which connects Ontario to Port Huron, Michigan, has been reporting delays tonight of nearly five hours. 

Now there is an obvious way to fix this problem. Manuel Moroun, who is the owner of the Ambassador Bridge into Michigan, just spelled it out for Justin Trudeau, who is not terribly bright. End the vaccine mandates and the bridge reopens. It's not hard, but Justin Trudeau won't, and he's decided he doesn't have to because the truckers, as he's explained, have no legitimate complaint. They're racists, so we're not required to listen to them.  

Here was Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament on Monday: 

  

Oh, so they're not even really Canadians? They're Nazis. So you don't have to hear anything they say. They don't even belong here. Maybe we'll intern them or expel them. Trudeau state broadcasters have been repeating these lies over and over and over again for maximum effect. Pravda parroting Brezhnev. That's what they do. What's striking, however, is that the media in our country claim to be independent, but they've been doing the very same thing. 

There are QAnon supporters in the crowd. It's a cult. They're Nazis and they're crazy! Insurrectionists on the Edmund Pettus Bridge!"" Imagine.  

Now they're using these smears because typically they work. Just dismiss these people. Don't listen to them. They didn't go to college, but what Justin Trudeau apparently didn't count on is that a handful of independent journalists are committing journalism inside Canada and a free press works. That's why we have it - or did.  

So, instead of repeating state-mandated talking points, like their journalists do in the morons and our press corps do, these independent reporters have been broadcasting hours-long interviews with the truckers themselves in their cabs, totally unfiltered so you can decide what you think. You can actually make your own judgment about reality.  

So you watch these streams for just a few minutes, and you realize that these truckers, whatever their faults may be, are far less odious and much harder-working than the journalists and the politicians who call them Nazis.  

Here's one 24-year-old protester who saved up and bought his own truck. He's an owner-operator now. He's losing hundreds of dollars every day because he's no longer working, but he says it's worth it because he's more concerned about human rights than about his own paycheck. You decide.

Yeah, the voice of the working man there. Now, we know he's a Nazi? Because he used the word ""freedom."" Now that footage, of course, was not shot by the CBC, which is Canadian state media, the most dishonest of all. It was from a livestream on the YouTube channel Zot. It was filmed just after midnight this morning. 

 Zot is run by a man you've never heard of called Matt Garcia. Garcia is one of a handful of independent YouTube channel operators who are doing what legacy media refuses to do anywhere, ever, anymore. Garcia actually talks to people. He reports. He's not paid to do this. 

He's doing it because nobody else will do it. You should watch it. It's compelling because you can hear people speak and you can decide what you think about what they have to say.  

Here's another protester that Garcia spoke to in the streets of Ottawa. This man says that Justin Trudeau's authoritarian behavior reminds him of the ayatollahs in the country he left, which is Iran. 

So what's the answer to him? Is he in QAnon? Is he a Nazi? Is he a White supremacist? Canada's leaders have no response whatsoever. They just accuse all these people of bigotry and then they turn away.  

The protesters are so immoral we have no obligation to listen to them because democracy. We all lose when they do that because actually, the truckers do have something to say, and some of them are pretty articulate. Some of them are even eloquent about what they want. So, as a public service, we thought you might like to read it.

No, that's not extreme. If you want to see extremism, take a close look at how Canada's ruling class is responding to these decidedly non-extreme protests. Authorities in Canada are now stealing firewood from protesters in subzero temperatures.  

We're not making it up. Now, that one is not being used in a crime. They're not using it to rob liquor stores. The protesters are using the wood to keep from freezing to death in February, but Trudeau's enforcers just took it from them. They also seized fuel, which the truckers are using to keep from dying in their cabs overnight. Watch. 

  

So, let's say you were on American television or you worked at the Brookings Institution or the Atlantic Council or you were Liz Cheney or any one of the many people who lecture you every day about democracy. What would you make of that exchange? Now you might not like the guy's beard, or you may not like who we voted for, but what's your answer to him?  

If police are breaking the law by enforcing an order from the guy who runs the country, is that a democracy? No, it's not. It's not a free country. It's a very scary place and that's exactly what Canada has become under Justin Trudeau.  

We'll show just one more example. There are a lot of these, but we're not going to drag it out. You see the point. Watch this one. These are police acting under Justin Trudeau's orders, dragging an elderly man to jail and hurting him along the way. Why? Because he dared to honk his horn in support of the truckers.  

They hurt him too. Look up his bruises on the internet. So in the end, Canadians are nice people. The cliche is true and they're seeing some of this. It's being hidden from them on their state media, but it's all on the internet.  

So, Justin Trudeau is attacking human rights and attacking humans, and that ultimately is bound to provoke a backlash, and it is. The province of Alberta just announced it is lifting its COVID restrictions and scrapping its vaccine passport system completely. Saskatchewan, Quebec, Prince Edward Island have done the same. They're getting rid of most of their COVID restrictions in the face of this, in response to this. When you go too far as Ceausescu learned, people turn against you.  

It was just a few days ago that a guy called Jagmeet Singh, he's the leader of Canada's supposedly pro-worker NDP party, smeared the truckers as racists, of course, ""those that claim the superiority of the White bloodline."" What a pig. It's always the same lie, but yesterday, even Jagmeet Singh finally realized the same old slander doesn't work anymore. So he went to Plan B. He went for a federal plan to ""exit the pandemic."" 

In other words, he caved in the face of principled human rights protests. That's how that works. Several members of Justin Trudeau's own Liberal Party are now rebuking Justin Trudeau. One of those lawmakers, a member of parliament called Joel Lightbound, described Justin Trudeau's vaccine mandates as ""an attempt to wedge to divide and to stigmatize. I fear that this politicization of the pandemic risks undermining the public's trust in our public health institutions.""  

Ya think? Yeah, we in America know a little bit about that. Who will trust a doctor when the smoke settles from coronavirus? Seriously. But on a political level, anyone watching this understands just how profound the betrayal is, the betrayal both in Canada and in the United States. Self-described liberals, the ones who've lectured you for decades about the nobility of organized labor are now taking the side of management, of strikebreakers over striking workers. They're applauding, like Mr. Burns on The Simpsons as cops harass and abuse strikers and their families.  

Pretty soon, they'll be demanding scabs, literally, if they aren't already. It's so deeply revealing. Scratch a liberal and you'll find a fascist. Today on Twitter, an Obama DHS official called Juliette Kayyem called for violence against the truckers. ""Slash their tires,"" she demanded, but don't stop there. ""Cancel their insurance, suspend their driver's licenses, prohibit any future regulatory certification for truckers, etc. Have we learned nothing? Fellow members of the ruling class? These things fester when there are no consequences."" Crush them before they get big ideas. 

 Now, Juliette Kayyem is a nasty little fascist, and of course, she is a CNN contributor, too. Of course she is, but we will concede Juliette Kayyem is right about one thing. These things do fester when you ignore the population's legitimate concerns for long enough. 

 When you dismiss, your own citizens as racists and conspiracy nuts and try and shut them down for long enough, at some point, they are apt to revolt. Once people realize they're citizens, not serfs, you can't really know where things go from there.  

And in that vein, tonight, a group of American truckers announced they will begin a nationwide truck convoy in this country starting next month in protest against Joe Biden's vaccine mandates. That rally will begin in southern California on March 5th, and then it will progress eastward, by truck, to Washington, D.C., a city they still perhaps naively assume is the capital of their country.  

How does the supposedly pro-union White House feel about this? They're completely panicked. Working-class people expressing their opinions? That's not allowed.  

So Joe Biden, taking a page from Justin Trudeau, his friend to the North, has already set the Department of Homeland Security to work to shut them down. We'll be covering that in some detail. There is some drama ahead.

601	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-canada-panicking-tyranny	2022-02-11 22:58:00	Tucker Carlson: Canada's leaders are panicking because their citizens are tired of tyranny | Fox News	"We’ve been covering this truck strike in  all week and at the end of the week there were a couple of different images that kind of floated around your head. Picture the cops stealing the fuel from the freezing truckers. Picture the smiling trucker talking about love and waving the Canadian flag. Totally non-threatening. But above all, you remember the hysteria of the people in charge as they look out on the sea of working-class people who are sick of being pushed around. The people in charge are extremely upset about this. Hysterical. It’s hilarious. You can just picture a transportation secretary, little  jumping up and down, shaking his little hands, screaming at the truck drivers, get off my bridge, you guys, get off my bridge right now!It’s not just Mayor Pete, you remember those angry tweets from the CNN contributor who suggested we should slash their tires, siphon their diesel fuel, throw them in prison. They're all Torquemada now. They are talking like they are scary. But keep in mind, these are not displays of power. This is not how confident people talk. These are squeaks of impotence. Our leaders are furious at the truckers because they know that there’s not a lot they can do about the truckers. They don’t know anything about trucks, for one thing. How do you get a truck off a bridge, especially when it has no fuel or tires? They have no idea You just order someone to do it. It’s kind of like an Uber eats. Some guy trots out and removes the truck. The problem is, the people who drive the trucks don’t feel like following orders anymore. They are ignoring Pete Buttigieg. 

If you actually want to move a big rig, you need tow truck operators. And those tow truck operators know truckers. They know truckers are not a racist. They are not Nazi's no matter how many times Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau claim they are. So some of them aren’t inclined to help. David Allen, for example, is the president of Gary's Towing in Thunder Bay, Ontario. He told Canadian media ""we have all the capabilities on our tow trucks to do it, but I don’t think anyone would want to."" Another tow truck operator said even if tow truck operators wanted to help, carry out Pete Buttigieg's orders it would be very hard, ""In the end, the truckers get a say on whether you are taking that truck away or not."" There are technical reasons for this, it turns out trucks are heavy. They have air brakes and steel-belted tires. Some truckers removed their tires completely. So what now? Now is when you start to panic. And they definitely are. This afternoon the Prime Minister of Canada clearly who is Fidel Castro’s illegitimate son, came out from hiding to threaten the protesters directly.

You could be breaking laws! That’s the funniest part. These people don’t care about the law at all. They believe they make the law. This is the prime minister who ordered the cops to steal people’s fuel. There is no law that says you can’t have fuel in Ottawa. He just made that up. Now he’s lecturing about the law. Joe Biden who was violating federal law on the grand scale every day by importing two million people illegally without your consent, he’s upset about the law. Justin Trudeau is so upset he is threatening the truckers' children. ""It’s time to go home especially if you have your kids with you,"" Trudeau said. Wouldn't want something to happen to them. 

Trudeau also attacked the protesters for closing the border. Only Justin Trudeau is allowed to do that. Which he has done for more than a year. So what are we watching here? It’s more than hypocrisy. What we are watching is panic. Justin Trudeau knows that nobody joined the protest because they are ""tired of COVID."" They are tired of tyranny. They are tired of being told to inject something into their bodies they don’t want, whose long-term effects cannot be known. Sold by companies that are protected, that have immunity from public recourse. 

We also know that what they told us to do didn’t work. The lockdowns didn’t work. Johns Hopkins came out and said it the other day. Pretty conclusively. That is what people are mad about. They want their freedom back. They are not tired of the virus, they are tired of the leaders who have used the virus to give themselves more power. And they're still doing it. Here is Ontario's premier Doug Ford. He announced today that instead of lifting his useless mandates, he’s going to steal the truckers money, fine them, and send them to jail.

When you start making threats like that, you’ve already lost. What you are showing is that you are impotent and that is why you are unreasonable. That is why you are hysterical. When you start stealing things from people, outside of the law, speaking of the law, everybody knows you are weak. Keep in mind that truckers raise $10 million on GoFundMe, that's a California company, but Canadian politicians had that effort shut down. Then GiveSendGo, a Delaware company, raised almost the same amount and Canadian politicians went after that money too. The attorney general of Ontario successfully got a court order to freeze access to the 8.4 million raised on GiveSendGo. Those funds were going to an adopted trucker fundraising campaign who is paying for ""housing, water, food, accommodations, and shuttle services"" for truck drivers in Ottowa. But all that money has just been stolen by the Canadian government. It has been seized. 

All of this is pushing people away from governmentissued currencies because they're controlled by lunatics like Ford. They are moving towards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Just like 18 wheelers on bridges, blockchain is pretty tough for authorities to control. Therefore, this is how you know it’s a threat: The crypto guys must be White supremacists. That is exactly what they are not telling us.

""It’s problematic at best."" How do people like that get on television? There should be an IQ requirement. By putting dumb people in the anchor chair, they are perfectly compliant to the people in charge. ""Crypto is White supremacy."" But the hysteria gives them away. As a trucker explained, these people are terrified, they are scared of losing control. The blockade at the Windsor Bridge panicked them. 

The downside of all of this is it's turning Canada into a legitimate police state, for real. One of Doug Ford's police officers harassed a woman at her home because of something she wrote on Facebook in support of the truckers. 

In 2022, the Stasi are chirpy. We are here is a proactive measure to inform you of your rights, not because we are spying on your social media. So to recap, donating to the truckers is criminal. Saying anything positive about the truckers gets the police to show up at your house. That is why truckers are the new QAnon, Russia, White supremacist, extremist threat. Our leaders agree. In Michigan dopey old Gretchen Whitmer is planning to attack them with bulldozers.

Working closely with our federal partners. Keep in mind, they’re not talking about ISIS, these are truck drivers, the people who bring you food. They are unarmed and waving Canadian flags talking about love. A lot of them brought their kids. Should CNN's national security contributors and the neoliberal politicians who are attacking them really weigh into this? No. Because they can’t win it. One side is too sympathetic. The other is too loathsome. But they can’t help themselves. They are so threatened by disobedience that they rush forward with swords drawn. They know if Canadian truckers can get away with it the game is over. So they must crush anyone who questions the high priest of neoliberalism. That category includes plenty of people on the right, obviously, but tellingly it includes plenty of people who aren’t on the right, but just feel like thinking for themselves.

 It includes anyone who invests in bitcoin. It includes Sikh truck drivers in Ottawa who now work for Putin. And Joe Rogan, who's now a racist, and David Portnoy, who's now a sex offender, and Tavis Smiley, who's now a serial harasser. Those aren't right-wingers, those are just people who dare to say what they think. 

That slander hasn’t worked. And it won’t work here. You can’t cancel a bridge full of 18-wheelers and shame them into driving away. They are going to try it tomorrow. There’s going to be a showdown in Windsor, Ontario. We'll see what happens. But the rest of the world has already learned the lesson. Which is, if you resist, if you say you’ve had enough, peacefully, cheerfully, with love, they have to pay attention. It’s the only thing they pay attention to.

If you watch  closely over his four years in office, and we did, it became pretty clear that the more outlandish the claim that Trump happened to be making, the more likely it was to be true.  

Trump did tend to exaggerate at times, but it's mostly about topics that didn't matter. How big was the crowd at his 2016 inauguration? Who cares? But on the big things, on matters of civilizational importance, Trump told the truth bluntly, often when nobody else would.  

The Iraq War was a mistake, Trump said. Illegal immigration is a disaster. China is taking over the world. Haiti is a pretty crappy place. Deafening hysteria followed every one of these demonstrably true statements. 

At one point in early 2018, CNN and the Washington Post got so worked up trying to hide the obvious that they devoted blanket coverage to the claim that actually, Haiti is an awesome and fully functional country, a perfect spot for your next family vacation and, by the way, if you disagree with that, you're racist. That's what they told us.  

Three years later, they have dropped the POWs, at least on Haiti. Our leaders now consider Haiti so awful that just being from there qualifies you for asylum in the United States. With Trump gone, they can finally admit that. What was once a dangerous conspiracy theory is now just a sensible observation, especially when it justifies more immigration.  

For four years, no dangerous conspiracy theory was considered more dangerous or more conspiratorial than the claim that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign had spied on Donald Trump. The very idea that Hillary Clinton, of all people, had spied on anyone was preposterous. The media informed us only a lunatic would claim otherwise.  

By making a charge like that, in fact, Trump was emboldening our enemies and degrading the public's confidence in our democratic system. So, it wasn't just a stupid opinion that Trump had, it was really a form of treason and yet, as usual, Trump kept saying it.  

He did it again in one of his last sit-down interviews as president with Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes."" 

""No, as a matter of fact, we can’t verify that."" This is CBS News. We don't air things we can't verify. Really, Lesley Stahl? Is that true? We still remember a CBS News piece from 2016 that claimed  Donald Trump was secretly working with Vladimir Putin. So, the question is, how did CBS News verify those facts? Walk us through your reporting process.  

Well, as it turns out, that particular story, the reporting came from reading a piece on Slate.com, probably while standing in line at Starbucks. Slate alleged that the Trump campaign was coordinating with a Russian bank called Alfa Bank, using a hidden server in Trump Tower.  

How did Slate.com know this? By consulting a ""small, tightly-knit community of computer scientists."" 

These scientists, Slate insisted, we're totally nonpartisan. One of the sources explained, anonymously, ""We wanted to defend both campaigns because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election.""  

So here you have just another unnamed computer scientist defending election integrity. Makes sense. Don't ask questions.  

Jake Sullivan did not ask questions. Jake Sullivan takes Slate.com very seriously. At the time, Jake Sullivan was working for the Hillary Clinton campaign. He cited the Slate story as evidence that Trump was indeed colluding with Vladimir Putin.

""The secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump's ties to Russia,"" Sullivan said.  

What a tool. 

""We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia."" 

So, there was a bat phone in Trump Tower that rang directly in the Kremlin. Jake Sullivan stuck to that line for months. Here he is on CNN in March of 2017. 

Oh, the secret hotline. These people are literally willing to say anything if it gives them power, but listen carefully to what Jake Sullivan said. ""I don't have a line into the FBI on this."" Everything I know is from ""public reporting."" 

So you'll notice that Sullivan went out of his way to say that, what should have been a very clear sign that it was a lie and indeed it was a lie. In fact, the Hillary Clinton for President campaign was coordinating directly with the FBI.  

A Clinton lawyer called Michael Sussmann had been feeding false claims about Trump and Russia, once again from that crack team of nonpartisan computer scientists to the General Counsel at the FBI, a man called James Baker.  

But Sussmann didn't stop there. In February of 2017, after the election, Sussmann also met with the General Counsel at CIA. So at this point, you may be wondering about the identity of those nonpartisan computer scientists who dug up all this new information about Donald Trump's direct connection to Vladimir Putin.  

Who are these people? We may not be shocked to learn they weren't nonpartisan. Once again, Jake Sullivan was lying to us. In fact, a pro-Hillary Clinton activist from South Africa called Rodney Joffe had put together a team of digital researchers. Oppo guys, we used to call them. Msost of them came from Georgia Tech.  

In emails, Rodney Joffe explained why he was doing this. He wanted Hillary to win the presidency because Hillary Clinton had promised him a job as a top cybersecurity officer in the U.S. Government. So Joffe wanted to help Hillary win, he said that.  

In order to do that, he gave his nonpartisan computer scientists a mission. Their job was to gather data they had access to, thanks to a Pentagon contract, in order to connect Donald Trump to Putin. 

Now we know all this thanks to a new court filing from Special Counsel John Durham, who spent the last few years investigating the origins of the Russia hoax and is finally producing some material.  

In the words of Durham's filing ""Joffe tasked those researchers to mine internet data to establish 'an inference' and a 'narrative' tying then-candidate Trump to Russia."" 

So, this wasn't reporting, of course, they had a goal. They were trying to get Hillary elected president. The amazing thing is how they did it, where their data came from. 

The filing says that Joffe and his computer scientists intercepted internet traffic, that is emails and presumably text messages, from ""Trump Tower, Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building and the Executive Office of the President of the United States."" 

In other words, Trump was right. This isn't a conspiracy theory. His claims were true. Democrats were spying on Donald Trump, not just as a candidate, but as president of the United States in the White House, as well as in his own home. 

So, has anything like this ever happened in American history? Not that we know of, but Jeff Bezos doesn't think you should worry about it or even know that it happened. 

Today's Washington Post informed it's brain-dead readership that while, ""Trump is once again claiming that he was spied upon."" That claim has been ""debunked."" 

Oh, really? How has it been debunked?  

Shut up. It just has. 

But in fact, that claim has not been debunked. It has been verified. That claim is true. It actually happened and the way it happened tells you everything about why it has been so extraordinarily difficult to bring democracy back to the United States. A government contractor spied on a populist presidential candidate, then passed the information to his opponent's campaign, which gave it to the FBI and the news media, which distorted it to create the illusion of treason, which was then cited by the politician who paid for the whole thing as a reason not to vote for the guy she spied on.  

Got it? It's a closed-loop. Everyone's got a role. Here's Hillary Clinton during the presidential debates: 

So, if you're not all in with NATO, if you think it's a pointless boondoggle that endangers the United States, you, my friend, work for Vladimir Putin.  

""You encouraged espionage,"" shrieked Hillary. At the very moment, she's doing precisely that. They always denounce you for their own sins, but she said Russia has engaged in cyberattacks on the United States and that's probably true in point of fact. But she was speaking about a specific ""cyberattack."" 

She was talking about the Russians hacking the servers at the DNC. Democrats wasted three years of our lives telling us that, at an ever-increasing volume. Here's the interesting thing. It was not true. It has never been true. Vladimir Putin did not hack the DNC. There was never any evidence that the Russians hacked the DNC. 

Instead, the DNC emails were very clearly stolen from within the building, most likely by a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to show the world how Bernie Sanders was being shafted by the very same corrupt forces in Washington that later shifted Donald Trump. That was very obvious to anyone who's paying attention at the time.  

What's interesting is that no one's been punished for it. Likely, no one ever will be. In fact, Jake Sullivan, the guy you just saw lying about those nonpartisan computer scientists, has not been indicted for what he did. Jake Sullivan has been promoted. 

Jake Sullivan is now Joe Biden's national security adviser. He's still screaming about Russia. Only this time it's not to bring down a Republican opponent in the presidential race. He's screaming about Russia to bring the entire country to war with a nuclear-armed power.

603	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-how-long-until-canadian-style-tyranny-comes-to-america	2022-02-15 23:45:00	Tucker Carlson: How long until Canadian-style tyranny comes to America? | Fox News	"‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ host argues Canadian prime minister is combating trucker protests through ‘tyranny.’

A lot is happening in the news. Here's one item that we noticed:  canceled democracy last night. And the remarkable thing is no one in this country seemed to notice that it happened. There was no outcry from our political class, as their friend  declared martial law in response to an entirely peaceful protest from his country's working class. 

Our news  barely noted that it happened. Weirdest of all, the , which exists these days to denounce such attackers of democracy as Hungary and Poland, didn't say a single word as democracy in Canada ended. That's pretty weird, if you think about it. 

Canada is not some exotic, faraway land with an alien culture and unintelligible language. It's not . Canada is our neighbor. It's our trading partner. Canada is our closest ally on Earth. It's frankly part of our country. Our vice president grew up in Canada, so did half of our comedians and actors and singers. Our border with Canada is the longest border in the world. It stretches more than 5,500 miles. So on every level, we are deeply intertwined with Canada, whether we notice it or not. 

What happens there matters here. If nothing else, it's a preview of what will likely happen in the . So with that in mind, you should know that Justin Trudeau is no longer the prime minister of Canada. Justin Trudeau is Canada's maximum leader, its strongman, its potentate. Justin Trudeau is the dictator of Canada. If you think that's an overstatement, try to think of another way to describe what Justin Trudeau is now doing. 

For the first time in Canada's history, Trudeau has invoked what's known as the Emergencies Act, but the protests he is facing hardly qualify as an emergency. But suddenly, Justin Trudeau has the power to crush all political opposition to his rule, and that's exactly what he's doing. Trudeau has ended  in Canada. He's banned free assembly. Trudeau's government has shut down political rallies and arrested his political critics without probable cause. Trudeau has instituted internal passports, that restrict travel within Canada, to the politically obedient. Canadians are no longer allowed to leave their own country unless they obey Justin Trudeau. And if they don't obey, they could be bankrupted and destroyed. He now has the power to do that. Trudeau has claimed the power to freeze the financial assets of any Canadian who resists him. No court order is required to do this, he just decides. 

Justin Trudeau can even dictate what you do for a living and how you do it. Today, Trudeau threatened to arrest tow truck drivers who refused to tow the trucks of protesters. Is this really about stopping the spread of ? No one in Canada is even pretending that it is anymore. Trudeau himself didn't mention the risk of COVID a single time yesterday. He's not worried about unvaccinated truckers spreading a virus. Trudeau is worried about Canadians resisting his rule. And that's why Trudeau's government announced yesterday they plan to regulate cryptocurrency forever. Watch. 

DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: 

Oh, the Terrorist Financing Act. So that was a law passed to defeat Al Qaeda. Now it's being used to stop law-abiding Canadians, middle-class people, students, truck drivers, from protecting their earnings from the total mismanagement of Canada's Central Bank. Justin Trudeau has wrecked the Canadian ; but thanks to the Terrorist Financing Act, there is no escape from the consequences. Canadians are going to have to live with the consequences of Justin Trudeau's fiscal recklessness, whether they want to or not. Otherwise, they're terrorists. 

It shouldn't surprise you that Trudeau's first move in the face of a trucker protest was to clamp down on cryptocurrency.  will try this in this country, guaranteed. They'll tell us Bitcoin is a Russian plot, CNN will dutifully back them up. Watch it happen. But at the same time, you've got to wonder, since we're speaking of terrorism, what happened to the actual terrorists? Those do exist. How is Justin Trudeau treating them? Well, let's see. A few years ago, Justin Trudeau gave more than $10 million in taxpayer money in a settlement to a self-described Al Qaeda soldier called Omar Khadr. Khadr murdered a U.S.  sergeant. 

Now murdering a U.S. Army sergeant is bad, but it's not as bad as criticizing Justin Trudeau. So Trudeau did not freeze Khadr's bank account. Instead, he just made him rich and moved on. When anti-Christian arsonists burned more than 50 Catholic churches across Canada, Justin Trudeau did not declare an emergency. Instead, he issued a statement sympathizing with them, ""It is fully understandable,"" Trudeau said, ""Given the shameful history we all becoming more aware of.""

Are you beginning to see how this works? In a dictatorship, the only real  is opposing the regime. So how did all this happen so quickly in a country as nice and moderate as Canada? Well it happened the way that it always happened. It happened with maximum aggression and limited popular support. Justin Trudeau won reelection last year with less than a third of the national vote. In fact, he finished the election behind his main competitor, the Conservative Party. Thanks to quirks in the parliamentary system, Trudeau took power anyway, and he immediately began to crack down on anyone who opposed him. Trudeau had relatively few supporters, but they turned out to be the right supporters. They were the people with power. 

The woman, for example, you just saw announcing the crackdown on cryptocurrency is Canada's deputy prime minister. But before she was that, she was a long-time journalist, including in our country. She used to write for The Washington Post. She's currently married to a New York Times reporter. Why is that relevant? Well, because up and down this story, you see the starring role that media organizations have played in the death of Canadian democracy. The other day, for example, somebody hacked the  of the crowdfunding website Give Fund Go, and then revealed the names of people who donated to the truckers protesting in Ottawa. You've got to ask yourself who would have the tech savvy and the political motive to do something like that? Well, state intelligence agencies would. In fact, we can't really think of anybody else. It would certainly be interesting to find out who did it. It's a big part of the story. But media companies seem curiously uninterested in finding out who did it. Instead, they immediately started using this stolen information to intimidate the donors. 

Anyone who dared to send money to Justin Trudeau's political opponents was unmasked in public, shamed, and of course, inevitably threatened. Because that's what happens. Trudeau's state TV channel, the CBC, has been working on this retribution project all day long. They knew who their enemies are, and they knew who their master is. It's Justin Trudeau. But Canada's National Post newspaper is doing the same thing. The National Post is supposedly independent of the government, but they're still doing it. In this country, Vice Media, to its great and eternal shame, has been doing the same thing. 

So what do all of these media companies have in common? Well, they're all squarely on the side of entrenched power against the population they supposedly serve. That's the opposite of what journalism was designed to do. But at this point, it is the rule. Not just in the United States, but around the world. Reporters and politicians and big  all align against voters, against you. Have you noticed? Earlier this week, the CBC warned Canadians that the word freedom has ""become common among far-right groups."" So only QAnon wants freedom. Remember that the next time you complain about Justin Trudeau. 

Media organizations have been agitating against democracy for years now, even as they've posed loudly as its greatest defenders. In February of 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, Vice Media ran this headline: ""Anti-vaxxers are terrified the government will 'enforce' a vaccine for coronavirus."" ""Anti-vax groups on social media are claiming that the spread of the disease will lead to mandatory vaccinations and unlimited surveillance."" Yeah, those conspiracy nuts. Now that all of that has actually happened, Vice has not apologized, instead Vice is helping Justin Trudeau to hurt anyone who complains about him. 

In October of that same year, 2020, the CBC warned Canadians about a ""disinformation campaign [that] falsely suggests Canadians will be forcibly sent to quarantine sites."" A few months later, as if on cue, the Trudeau government began forcibly sending Canadians to quarantine sites. But the CBC never apologized for posting what turned out to be disinformation. Instead, they set about enforcing Justin Trudeau's latest decrees. They see that as their job. So by the way, this is the so-called academic community. These are the university professors who've been granted lifetime job security, precisely so they can think for themselves. Freely, independent from government control. And yet, in practice, no one is more controlled by the government than they are. Here's a professor from Canada's Carleton University — that's an institution heavily funded by Justin Trudeau — telling CNN's viewers how dangerous and immoral it is to criticize Justin Trudeau in any way. Watch. 

PROFESSOR: 

Oh, they hold anti-government views, that's the crime. But isn't holding anti-government views allowed in a democracy? In fact, isn't the measure of democratic government the degree to which you're allowed to question the people in charge? Well, that used to be the definition of democracy. It's not anymore, certainly not on CNN. The CNN anchor who heard that just nodded. Yes, it is indeed a scary problem when Canadians disagree with Justin Trudeau — arrest them. On MSNBC, which is less subtle, but a lot more straightforward most of the time, they're telling Justin Trudeau to stop with the half measures; the problem with Canada is it's not authoritarian enough. Time to get the stick and start hurting people. 

JOE SCARBOROUGH: 

Settle down, tough guy. There's going to be someone there with a stick. It's interesting. It's always the very same people who call for violence. It's almost like it excites them. It's not a good sign. So clearly there is an appetite for Canadian-style tyranny in this country, and the question is how long til we get it? Let's see. 

This morning we learned that American intelligence agencies are trying to censor a  website called ZeroHedge. Unnamed sources from Joe Biden's intel community told The Associated Press, off-the-record of course, that ZeroHedge was, ""spreading Russian propaganda,"" by which they meant criticizing Joe Biden. We can't have that. So how long before they pull ZeroHedge off the internet? How long before they try the same thing with Joe Biden's many other critics in the media? All of whom, we can tell you firsthand, have also been accused of working for Vladimir Putin. 

And when that does happen, when these voices are silenced, what will we call it then? CNN will, of course, describe it as a necessary national security measure. But it's not that. It's tyranny. And by the way, since when does the  get to decide what websites Americans read? Are there any civil libertarians left in this country? Old-fashioned liberals, anyone? What do they think of this? Maybe they don't notice it. In their defense, it's hard to notice sometimes with leaders like Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau. They don't look very threatening. They're not the  version of fascist. Look at Justin Trudeau. He's absurd. The '70s haircut, all those little outfits when he feels like playing dress-up. He doesn't look dangerous, he looks ridiculous. 

But maybe Justin Trudeau is smarter than he looks. Leaders like Biden and Trudeau avoid the usual tells. They don't use armies to invade other countries, for example. Instead, they promote color revolutions and control foreign governments from afar. That's exactly what they did in Ukraine, which became a far more repressive place once Joe Biden began running it, and he does run Ukraine. Make no mistake. That's what they do. This new class of dictators seizes power incrementally, through the bureaucracy. They never raise their voices. They don't wave their arms. They smile and they tell you they're protecting democracy and public health. They praise diversity, even as they demand conformity. They're entirely passive-aggressive. But they're no less dangerous. One morning you wake up and they've canceled your job and seized your bank account for the crime of disagreeing with them. This is the architecture of tyranny, and it's not just happening in Canada. It's happening here in the United States. It will be used against us. Bet on it.

So much drama, you can't say we're not learning a lot, though. And one topic we've learned a lot about over the last year is . And the reason we've learned about it is that Russia is  number one favorite topic of conversation. Joe Biden can talk about Russia forever, meaning in his case for up to four minutes at a time, which at this stage is Joe Biden's version of a filibuster. 

You may have asked yourself: When will Joe Biden ever stop talking about Russia? Well, very soon, actually. In fact, he seems to be losing his train of thought right now. But don't worry, he'll be back to it. Russia is a very comfortable topic for Joe Biden. He enjoys talking about it much more than talking about, say, , or , or fentanyl deaths or about how half the population of Haiti appears to be showing up in Florida in leaky boats. 

Those subjects may interest you since you live in this country, but not Joe Biden, despite appearances, Biden doesn't actually live here. In his head, Joe Biden is floating high above the Sea of Azoff, swooping in over south-eastern Ukraine like a Botox superhero just to make sure everything's OK with his little buddies, the Ukrainians. Joe Biden is a protector that way. 

But he's also, at the same time, a scholar and a teacher, not a credentialed educator like the doctor he's married to. Joe Biden didn't go to community college in Delaware for a doctorate in diversity studies. He's just a civilian. But Biden can still lecture with the best of them. If you signed up for his ""Intro to Russia is Bad"" class this semester, you will not be disappointed. Professor Biden knows that material cold. 

So what have we learned so far? Well, first and foremost, Russia is bad. That's the name of the course. It's the entire syllabus, actually. It may be the only fact you will come away with after months of heavy coursework. Russia is bad. Learn that and you will ace the exam. 

Now, to be clear, we're talking about Russia here. We're not talking about the Soviet Union. There's a difference, and Joe Biden's been around long enough to know what that difference is. He's seen it firsthand. 

The Soviets wanted peace. Joe Biden told us that repeatedly in the 70s and 80s. Russia, by contrast, just wants war. The Russians are warlike people. It's inherent. Russians are driven by bloodlust. They have tiny brains. Their breath smells like herring. They're always drunk, often on aftershave or household cleaning products. On Sunday mornings, when good people are still asleep at home with their families, your average Russian will still be lurking through the dark streets, leering through bloodshot eyes, trying to subvert somebody else's democracy or conquer a peace-loving neighbor. That's just who Russians are. It's what they do. 

But if there's one thing you absolutely must know about Russia, if you're going to navigate this world, that thing is that on February 16th, 2022, Vladimir Putin is going to invade our closest ally in the world, Ukraine. So write that down February 16, 2022. Ukraine invasion begins. That's the day. 

Joe Biden has been very clear about that. So the intel agencies and of course, their stenographers in the news media. As Politico put it, ""Russia will start a physical assault on Ukraine as soon as February 16, multiple U.S. officials confirmed"" 

A physical assault. But this won't be your typical physical assault like the kind you've experienced in the New York City subway. No. 

According to Politico, this physical assault ""could be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyber-attacks."" So these aren't just gang members, they're Russians. 

The Daily Mail confirmed Politico's reporting. ""Putin has decided to invade Ukraine on Wednesday,"" read the headline. ""Brits and Americans told to get out now."" 

That same day, The Mirror in London, let us know they had seen Vladimir Putin's planning documents and operation snuff out Ukrainian democracy was already in motion. ""Russian invasion of Ukraine set for 3:00 a.m. tomorrow with missiles and tank attack."" 

So February 16, 2022 was definitely the day the music was going to die in Ukraine. Everybody knew that. But weirdly, nobody thought to tell the president of Ukraine, who, as an obedient puppet of the Biden State Department, you might think would have heard the news. But no, he hadn't. He was baffled by it. 

He said this, ""We are told that February 16th will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hang national flags, wear blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity."" That was President Zelinsky. 

Now, keep in mind that in addition to being a puppet of the Biden administration, President Zelensky of Ukraine was also at one point a low-grade comic of some kind. So he was kidding. That was a joke. But in the American news media, there are no jokes. Humor has been banned for several years now. In fact, at this point, we're likely to hear a joke on a Russian news broadcast that on American television, which is pretty amazing. If you think about it, things have changed. Now, the readers of a teleprompter on our TV channels did not get this joke at all. So here's the coverage they produced: 

Well, if that was up to . They didn't get it was a joke. So it put us in a very weird position where suddenly we were being lectured on humor by eastern Europeans. Think about that for a minute. 

Zelensky’s staff issued a statement explaining that actually, he was kidding. So some news outlets had to update the reporting, but they were clearly annoyed with Zelensky. 

""Ukrainian leader makes a confusing joke about Russian invasion,"" harrumphed New York Magazine. 

But here's the funniest part of all: There was no invasion Feb. 16, 2022 was yesterday. Nothing happened. Vladimir Putin did not invade Ukraine. 

Now, if Joe Biden noticed the lack of an invasion, he didn't acknowledge that. He didn't say a word. Today, he was back on television, assuring us once again, the invasion is coming. 

So here's a guy who's literally wearing a mask outside, assuring us that he's sane and on the ball enough to know when Putin is going to invade Ukraine. But of course, he's gotten it wrong. 

What's going on here? Well, the most obvious explanation is the most obvious one. Doddering old Joe Biden, who even before he was senile, was widely considered a moron in Washington, has been played by Vladimir Putin, who may be evil but definitely is not stupid. If Putin bluffed an invasion of Ukraine to make Biden look ridiculous, it worked. 

Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe Putin still plans to invade Ukraine. It's hard to know, but as you just heard, Joe Biden doesn't know because he refuses to talk to the Russians. The Russians are too immoral for Joe Biden. That's saying a lot coming from a former credit card lobbyist who helped run America's most corrupt state. 

But according to Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin is not someone you can ever talk to because he put bounties on the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. How does Joe Biden know that happened? Well, he got it from the very same people who spent all last month telling us that Putin was going to invade Ukraine on February 16. 

Here they are:

So the most discredited people in the world, weighing in with total certainty on the most important topics. If you were to sum up the moment we're living in, that's how you describe it. Everything that is told you turned out to be untrue. They were lying. Why were they lying about that? Well, of course, to keep us in Afghanistan forever. 

Why would they want to do that, you ask? We weren't achieving anything. Obviously. The second we left, the Taliban took over and became one of the best-armed militaries in the entire region. So what we were doing wasn't working, but they didn't want us to leave. In fact, they were willing to lie to keep us there. Why? 

Well, we don't have any special intel, but we're thinking maybe the defense industry profligate campaign donors may have had something to do with it. 

Here's Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut explaining that actually, Ukraine needs a lot more lethal weapons from Raytheon: 

So that guy who lied about his own war service is pretty excited at the thought of Ukrainians fighting and dying in the streets. These people are so ghoulish. 

And of course, they're promoting war, not to maintain the democracy that is Ukraine. Ukraine is not a democracy. It has never been a democracy in its history and it's not now. It's a client state of the Biden administration. It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely shut down by the government. Is not a democracy at all. And it's insulting they would suggest otherwise. 

But people like that and many people in Washington are pushing Ukraine toward war. So we're sending them weapons and then making it very easy for them to use them. They told us now for months that any preemptive attack by Ukraine actually isn't real. If you see Ukraine using these weapons, ‘no,’ says Tony Blinken. That's not aggression. It's a false flag attack by Russia. 

So if they're going to use chemical weapons, but it won't actually be them, it'll be those diabolical Russians drunk on aftershave. 

Once again, there's zero evidence that any of this is true. This is clearly some sort of intel operation that's being filtered through the State Department and the media. 

But yet, for months now, they told us Russia is definitely to manufacture a pretext for a Ukraine invasion. So finally, a lone AP reporter bravely asked ""How do you know this?"" And they immediately accused him of working for Putin. 

He's pretty much the only reporter who asked a question like that, and there's a depressing irony to that. Matt Taibbi put it very nicely this morning in a piece on Substack. ""A big reason we're supposed to be an improvement over Putin's Russia,"" Taibbi wrote, ""is that we don't use the news media as an instrument of information warfare. At least Russian reporters don't have much choice in being conscripted for this duty. What's the excuse of Westerners who broadcast CIA gibberish on command?"" 

Well, that's a very good question, and the answer is they have no excuse.

We told you at the beginning of the week that Canada had descended into tyranny, and in fact it has. Justin Trudeau has declared that he controls all the money in . He can take yours at will.  

Today, Trudeau had nonviolent protesters and independent reporters arrested. In some cases, they were trampled with horses. These are the most egregious human rights violations by a Western government in recent memory, and yet the Biden administration is encouraging all of it. Biden's State Department has refused to criticize Justin Trudeau and his successes in any way. Instead, our mannequin-in-chief spent yet another day yammering on about Ukraine, as if we're supposed to believe that's more important than our own problems.  

What country is this guy in charge of anyway? Someone ought to tell him, and in fact, we were going to tell him right at the top of tonight's show. That was our lead, a serious topic for a serious time. And then, out of nowhere, we received an early copy of ""Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC."" It's a book-length suck-up to  by the editors at New York Magazine. It's coming out next week.  

Now, a hagiography of Sandy Cortez is like a box of Fig Newtons. You know it's wrong to open it, but the temptation is strong, and so we did. And before we knew it, we consumed the whole thing. We still feel sick. So that is what we're opening with tonight, the new Sandy Cortez book. 

Yes, it's a lighter topic than tyranny in Canada or war in . Our only excuse is it's Friday and we've got limited self-control of stuff like this. It's an amazing book. Let's put it this way. It opens by comparing Ocasio-Cortez to Jesus and then it suggests that because she once got second place in a high school science competition, she could have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. It is a remarkable piece of journalism.  

We planned to put extensive excerpts from the book … for you to read, and then we thought: Who reads anymore? Not Sandy Cortez. She never reads. Reading is racism. It's so White people. So instead, we've asked our senior producer, Alex McCaskill, to read the passages for us. You may recognize Alex McCaskill's melodious outer London-inflected voice from the Stacey Abrams soft-core porn novels that we featured on the show. We've asked him today to compare these two projects. He said he found this one creepier. We'll let you be the judge. Here's a section in which the fan girls at New York Magazine let us know why they wrote this book in the first place. There are a lot of politicians they could have fawned over. They picked Sandy Cortez because she's a lady.  

So she's not just the first woman to represent her congressional district in the state of New York. She's the first woman in human history to get elected to something and then ""live fully out loud while female."" What exactly does that mean? Is it a trans thing? Honestly, we don't know. She's definitely loud. But we did understand the next line: ""The degradations of womanhood are personal to her."" Well, that's certainly true. No one has done more personally to degrade American womanhood than Sandy Cortez has. She is living proof that 60 years of feminist liberation did not work. Sandy Cortez has not empowered. She's neurotic and silly. She is far more frivolous than any 1950s housewife ever was. June Cleaver was a more serious person. At least she made dinner. Here's what Sandy Cortez does. She puts on makeup while talking about herself.

They don't take me seriously when I put on eyeshadow. People are calling me unintelligent just because I'm dumb. It's pretty funny, but the funniest of all was hearing Sandy Cortez described herself as a ""woman of color."" She often does. No one ever dares to challenge that description, but every honest person knows it is hilariously absurd.  

There is no place on Earth, outside of American colleges and newsrooms, where Sandy Cortez would be recognized as a ""woman of color,"" because she's not. She's a rich, entitled White lady. She's the pampered, obnoxious ski bunny in the matching snowsuit who tells you to pull up your mask while you're standing in the lift line at Jackson Hole. They're all the same. It doesn't matter which shade they are. Apparently, the editors at New York Magazine don't ski. They spend the entire book pretending that Sandy Cortez has just emerged from some teeming favela in the slums of Rio to save the world's poor. Reading it, you would have literally no clue she was a credentialed member of the over class. You'd think she was St. Francis.  

Radiant and white in her gown, bathed in the glow of holy righteousness, a prophet for our time. Imagine Isaiah, but with nails to match the handbag. That's how New York Magazine describes Sandy Cortez and that's weird because we live in this country too, and that's not at all how we remember the moment. Here's a clip from the speech the book is referring to. Look at this person and ask yourself if you can feel God's presence.  

A prophet, or proof that Adderall abuse is more common than we admit? We'll let you decide. We will tell you that the editors at New York Magazine are highly impressed by the way Ocasio-Cortez looks. They think she's hot. It's a major theme in the book, and in fact, it's a major theme with Ocasio-Cortez herself. She talks about her beauty constantly. Just a few weeks ago, she let us know how hard it is that everyone wants to sleep with her all the time. What a burden. It's like living as a nudist in the Dallas Cowboys locker room. Men are so aroused by her TikTok videos she can barely get through a day. Yet she does her job anyway. That's why she's a hero. The burden of sexiness weighs heavily on her sleek and tawny shoulders, but she bears up under it. Listen to New York Magazine's account.  

She could have been a model for a skin-care line, and that's why she's such an amazing political leader — because she's so pretty. Imagine a man saying that. It would probably be considered patronizing if not grounds for cancelation, but New York Magazine isn't ashamed to objectify Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It makes you wonder what would happen if one day she gained 100 pounds and got eczema on her nose and forgot to trim her ear hair? Well, you know what would happen. Her political influence would evaporate instantly. She's not the leader of an ideological movement. She's a living marketing campaign. Here she is selling cosmetics.  

So makeup a process. You know, you start small and then you work your way out. Concentric circles — that's the way she uses cosmetics, and we have to admit she seems pretty good at it. Painting her own face may be her one real skill. But something useful? It's a different story. Watch this CNN account of her attempt to assemble her own IKEA furniture.  

Obviously, there are a lot of self-involved people in politics, all of them, pretty much, but it takes a special kind of narcissist to imagine that the world desperately wants to see you bolt together a particle-board coffee table. But New York Magazine can't get enough of it. Here's their account of what you just saw. 

Imagine if you were the person who wrote that. So here's this crazed solipsist filming herself as she puts together a coffee table and eats popcorn, the least-compelling film made since Andy Warhol died, and this is what you call it, ""She's shone a bright light on her own complicated, multifaceted self."" That's the moment you have to be honest with yourself and say, ""It's time for me to retire."" By the way, the person who wrote this didn't even perceive how creepy it was.  

""'I'm alone today,' Ocasio-Cortez says, pointedly at the camera."" Is it just us, or does that sound like an invitation to a booty call? Maybe one step from, ""What are you wearing?"" Either way, it's a little strange. It's definitely oversharing and yet, according to the book, oversharing is the key to Sandy Cortez's success.

""The intimacy of an FDR fireside chat."" Sure, except that FDR never told us about his skin-care regimen. Somehow, he was able to win the Second World War anyway. You wonder how he did that. You also wonder what brand of concealer he used. Sadly, there was no Instagram then, so the details have been lost to history. Thank Heaven we know what Sandy Cortez uses.

You have to feel a little bad for the many heads of western democracies. For them, the end of the  pandemic is really the worst thing they can imagine.  

Put yourself in their position. For two years you've wielded unprecedented power over your country. You've told citizens where and when they can work and shop and worship and go outside. You've controlled what they wear. You've decided how their children will be educated and what drugs they must put into their bodies. For a person with no useful skills and limited job prospects in the real economy, and that describes all of them, it's been an extraordinary experience: No democratic leader in history has ever been this powerful, as powerful as you are right now. You're like a god. Each morning, you wake up and survey your creation, and you revel in your omnipotence. You can hardly believe how far you've come. The last thing you want is for all of it to end. 

But of course, it is ending. The virus that gave you these powers is in retreat. It's no longer a public health emergency. The vaccine that you promised would be a panacea, didn't work in the ways you pledged they would. They didn't stop infection or transmission. Now you've done your best to hide that fact, but everybody knows it. So for you, the jig is up. The ball is over. It's almost midnight. Just a few hours from now, you will once again be merely a scullery maid. You'll be taking orders from your citizens rather than giving them and the thought of that sends you into a panic.  

What do you do next? How do you make this moment last forever? There's only one way. You must find a new emergency that justifies making your powers permanent. If you're going to remain god, you're going to need the devil to fight. So, if you're wondering why so many western leaders suddenly are vilifying their own populations, people they were supposed to represent, this is why. Find an enemy, create a crisis, stay in power forever. It's the oldest recipe for tyranny that there is. If we don't recognize it in our own age, it's only because nothing like this was supposed to happen in a democracy, but it is happening, most clearly in .  

Last week, Justin Trudeau used a peaceful trucker strike to declare martial law. Trudeau seized control of the police. He shut down opposition media coverage. He declared himself the final arbiter of all financial transactions in the nation of Canada. These are dictatorial powers, but they were necessary, Trudeau explained, because this was an emergency. White supremacist and other sedition-minded forces, backed by foreign saboteurs (sound familiar?) threatened the very existence of . The truckers were effectively an invading army.  

Well, over the weekend,  defeated that army. They were unarmed. He is not. Trudeau cleared the trucker strike by force. Yet his emergency powers remain. Today, Justin Trudeau explained that he will remain in full control of Canada indefinitely. And that's essential, he said, to keep Canada safe, but the video tells a very different story. In fact, it's Trudeau's crackdown on human rights that has put Canadians in danger. Trudeau's forces told one woman she's no longer allowed to record what happens in her own city.  

""I just want a cup of coffee."" 

""Get out of here."" 

Multiply what you just saw by an entire country, and that's Canada tonight. There's no longer any pretext that this is about the COVID pandemic. No one in Trudeau's government is trying to protect Canadians from anything much less a virus. This is political repression.  

If you doubt that, consider what happened to a place called the Ionic Cafe. That's a coffee shop in downtown Ottawa. On Sunday, riot police tried to break into the cafe and shut it down. Why? Because the proprietors had dared to serve coffee to the truckers during the protest. Under Justin Trudeau, that is now a crime. A man called Enrico, who works at the cafe, said he saw Trudeau's forces mistreat a civilian on the sidewalk, possibly like the mistreatment you just saw. When he told them to back off, ""Hey, this is Canada,"" they turned on him.  

So that kind of thing is happening all over the capital city of Canada. The virus is in retreat, but there's a new crisis and that crisis is disobedience. Last week we showed you the footage of Trudeau's forces trampling a woman with horses. Now, internal texts show the officers who rode those horses celebrated what they did.  

""Just watch that horse video. That is awesome,"" said one officer. 

Awesome. An elderly woman being trampled by a horse. The Canadian government has confirmed that those texts are real but none of the supposedly progressive politicians in Canada care in the least. No one on the Canadian left or the American left, for that matter, has condemned any of this or any other grotesque violation of human rights in Canada. State media aren't even reporting that it's happening. But it is happening. Over the weekend, the show obtained footage of a particularly brutal beating in Ottawa during the crackdown. When you watch it, you can see a man being kneed repeatedly by Trudeau's men.

Kneeing him, again and again, and again. He wasn't resisting. And the man who shot that footage was called David Paisley. He runs a website called shedmedia.ca. Police have arrested Paisley and seized the camera equipment he used to shoot that— $5,000 worth. Now we thought that video was remarkable, so we alerted several Canadian media outlets over the weekend, including CBC and CTV to this footage. We gave them David Paisley's contact information, news organization to news organization. But none of them reported on it. So we looked into it ourselves.  

Several protesters who were there said that a trucker in an orange jacket called Csaba Vizi was attacked by police officers during the crackdown. We reached Csaba Vizi and he confirmed it and provided footage. It shows him exiting his cab calmly, kneeling down in front of his truck and clasping his hands behind his head. 

So the man surrenders, on camera, and then he's kneed repeatedly into submission. Now we'd love to have more footage, but it turns out none of Justin Trudeau's men was wearing a body camera at the time. That's pretty weird. No one in Canadian state media cares to follow up on that story, and so they're not. They don't care, either. 

The brutality is just one element of this crackdown. On Saturday, Ottawa's new police chief promised to hunt down the regime's enemies no matter where they are in coming months and ruin them financially. 

If you were involved in a protest, you'll be sanctioned and charged. What does that mean exactly? Well, last night, Justin Trudeau's government announced that it's also going after anyone who ""directly or indirectly participated in the protests."" According to Mark Strahl, who is a member of Canada's parliament, the dragnet has ensnared one of his constituents. It's a woman called Briane. Her crime? Donating $50 to the truckers. In response ""her bank account has now been frozen."" Briane is a single mom from Chilliwack, working a minimum wage job. She now has no money at all. So under Trudeau's new order, she won't simply lose access to her bank account. She will also lose access to credit unions, co-ops, trusts and loan providers.  

This is what the collapse of democracy looks like. It's not simply beating people in the streets. It's making it impossible for them to live because you steal all their money. You award yourself the power to control every dollar in your country. Where's that power come from? Well, it's a self-appointed power, that Justin Trudeau now has, and you prevent anyone from speaking out against you. So Trudeau is not just targeting people who parked their trucks in Ottawa, he's crushing anyone who supports them. He's going after their employers. Over the weekend, the owner of a trucking company in Ontario received this threatening call from Trudeau's authorities. 

So, Trudeau's government is promising to seize company assets and zero up bank accounts because one company truck parked on the street in Ottawa. It's not simply an overreaction, a grotesque overreaction to a peaceful protest. It's a wild and unprecedented expansion of powers that is permanent, and that make democracy impossible. Canada's finance minister explained that Trudeau is not going to give up this power. Ever.  

You'll notice that some of the harshest authoritarians, not simply in Canada, but across the West, speak in light, lilting voices going up on the last syllable. They don't sound like Mussolini, but they've awarded themselves greater powers. By the way, this all seems to have happened overnight in Canada, but that's simply because most Americans don't pay attention.  

A year ago, Canada's government began debating something called C-36. That bill would allow activists to head to court and accuse someone of ""contemplating hate speech""—not even saying something unauthorized, just thinking about saying it. So, what is hate speech exactly and what does it look like to contemplate it? Well, back around 2020, a man living in British Columbia wrote to complain to a Canadian government official called Bob Rae. The man wrote that ""you and your government have blood on your hands for not quarantining Canada's borders before we’d imported COVID from around the world."" 

Now you can agree with that or disagree with it, but it's hardly a wild opinion and of course, it will always be permitted in an actual democracy, but the Canadian official's response to Bob Rae's response ""Worthy of a block. Hate speech.""  

Criticized me, the person in power, and now it's hate speech. Now, contemplating saying something like that is itself a crime. Canadian government officials like Bob Rae can send people who criticize them to jail. Trudeau's government has moved to reintroduce Bill C-36 ""as quickly as possible."" 

Now, the Biden administration, you should know and not forget, has encouraged all of this. ""Vladimir Putin is the tyrant,"" they tell us, ""not Justin Trudeau."" At this point it's pretty clear that if you want to know the future they are planning for us in the United States, look north to Canada.

607	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hate-putin-americans-suffer	2022-02-23 00:38:00	Tucker Carlson: Americans have been trained to hate Putin, and will suffer because of it | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host weighs in on the Biden admin's foreign policy response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 

Since the day that  became president,  in Washington have told you it's your patriotic duty to hate . It's not a suggestion. It's a mandate. Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason. 

Many Americans have obeyed this directive. They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin. Maybe you're one of them. Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. It's the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe. 

Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to ? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? 

These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much? 

If you've been watching the news, you know that Putin is having a border dispute with a nation called Ukraine. Now, the main thing to know about Ukraine for our purposes is that its leaders once sent millions of dollars to  family. Not surprisingly, Ukraine is now one of Biden's favorite countries. Biden has pledged to defend Ukraine's borders even as he opens our borders to the world. That's how it works. Invading America is called equity. Invading Ukraine is a war crime. 

So with every day, we move closer to some kind of conflict with Russia, a conflict that could easily spin out of control given that the people running us have no fine motor skills, the administration assures us this has nothing at all to do with ripping Joe Biden's personal debts to Ukrainian oligarchs. Not at all. It's completely and totally unrelated. 

The point here is to defend democracy, not that Ukraine is a democracy. It is not a democracy. Ukraine's president has arrested his main political opponent. He has shut down newspapers and television stations that have dared to criticize him. So in American terms, you would call Ukraine a tyranny. But Joe Biden likes Ukraine. So Putin bad, war good. How will this conflict affect you? 

Will affect you quite a bit, actually. Energy prices in the United States are about to go way up, and that means that everything you buy will become much more expensive, from the food you eat to the car you drive to the tickets you need to take your family on vacation this summer, assuming you can still afford a vacation by then. You're about to become measurably poorer. That's not a guess. Joe Biden has admitted this. 

On the other hand, you're going to win an important moral victory against dastardly old Vladimir Putin, who is much, much worse than Justin Trudeau. Just so you know. So you can feel good about that because…because…let's see, come to think of it, why would you feel good about that? It seems like a pretty terrible deal for you and for the United States. Hunter Biden gets a million dollars a year from Ukraine, but you can no longer afford to go out to dinner. That's not a bargain. 

So what are we missing here? What we're missing is the big picture, and that's why Joe Biden has dispatched Kamala Harris to explain that picture to us. Kamala Harris’ old job was to open America's border. She did that. Her new job is to keep Ukraine's borders closed. Kamala Harris was in Europe the other day to explain the whole thing. She began with a history lesson, letting the European peoples know about their recent past, which she assumes they've forgotten since so few of them speak English. She opened with a traditional salutation, ""listen, guys,"" because that's the way real historians and states people talk. This is Kamala educating:

Listen, guys, you may be Europeans who live in Europe, but you don't fully understand the ramifications of war in Europe. That's your problem. The thing about Europe, you've had peace and security for more than 70 years. Kamala Harris just told the Europeans that. 

And that, by the way, is true, if you don't count the breakup of Yugoslavia, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1990s or the Soviet occupation of half of the landmass, which you manage the enslavement of hundreds of millions. But apart from that, Mrs. Lincoln, it's all been peace and security in Europe. Until now. The Soviets were fine. Vladimir Putin is bad. 

What do we do about that? Kamala Harris explains that too.

Got that. Take a breath and let it sink in. Here it is again: ""we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because, remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment and within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening, although open, although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe has merit.""

Well, of course it has merit. The only question is what the hell are you talking about? And the answer is, Kamala Harris has no real idea what she's talking about. She can't even point to the direction of what she's talking about. Her mouth opens and predigested chunks of language come tumbling out in no particular order. It's soothing to listen to until you try to understand what it means. 

As Kamala Harris told us just last month, ""It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day."" To which we'd respond: That's right, Miss Vice President Person, today is the first day of the rest of your life. Learn it. Love it. Live it. And while you're at it, eat, pray, love. 

You could just imagine Vladimir Putin's reaction to all of this when an aide drops a translated transcript of Kamala Harris remarks on his desk. The Slovic mind is a hall of mirrors. It sees traps at every intersection. Clearly, Kamala Harris must be setting some sort of trap for the Russians here. Her words don't make sense, but she can't possibly be dim and childish. America is a superpower. It would never put a senile man and an imbecile in charge of the country. 

On the other hand, maybe so. And by the way, it's not just our country. A few weeks ago, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, met with his British counterpart, Liz Truss. Lavrov asked Truss if her country recognized Russian sovereignty over Rostov and Varonis, both of which are actually parts of Russia. So it was a trick question. But Liz Truss, who used to work in sales, had no idea. So she replied that Great Britain would never recognize these regions as Russian, despite the fact they already are Russian. 

So Liz Truss has no idea what she's talking about, either. But here's the thing: She wasn't embarrassed about that. None of them are embarrassed about that. 

John Bolton knows a lot. On the other hand, he spent decades weakening America with terrible foreign policy ideas and getting a lot of decent people killed for no good reason at all. So you think at this point, if justice were real, John Bolton would be living in isolation and shame somewhere, spending his days in atonement. That's what you would do. But that's not what he's doing. No. John Bolton went on MSNBC demanding yet another war, this one with the nuclear-armed power.

So, the only problem with Joe Biden's Ukraine policy, says John Bolton, is that it's too weak. Your kids aren't fighting there right now, hunkered down in February, shooting at Putin. Let's try a winter war in Russia. No one's done it before, but we have high hopes. 

Alexander Vindman is, in fact, demanding it. Unlike the British Foreign Secretary, Alexander Vindman knows quite a bit about Ukraine. In fact, he was born there. Alexander Vindman believes you have a moral obligation to defend his homeland, and if you don't, you're a murderer. He said so on MSNBC.

Yeah, they're going to die. So your job is to take up arms in defense of Alexander Vindman's home country or else you're evil, your blood on your hands and that's effectively our policy. Ok, Alexander Vindman. You got us. It’s a compelling argument. We're in. What's this going to cost us to defend the country you were born in? Well, in fact, Joe Biden addressed that question today. ""Defending freedom will have cost for us here at home,"" Biden said. ""We need to be honest about it."" Really. Biden went on to outline what he called the pain of our sanctions.

So let's put aside the question of why you would ever want to shut down any energy pipeline anywhere, ever, especially now crude oil is nearing $100 a barrel, it's the highest price since 2014. That's not a small thing because you need energy to live. It's not negotiable. So how does having less energy help the United States? Joe Biden didn't even hint at an answer to that. He didn't answer any questions. He ran away the second he had finished reading the script. 

Back in real life, every person knows nothing will tank our economy faster than cutting off the supply of fossil fuels, because despite what you may have heard from noted energy experts like Sandy Cortez, a country of 340 million people can't run on windmills and solar panels. And even if we had enough of those, which we don't, we don't have the transmission lines to get that power to your house, and we won't for a long time. 

So that's all a lie. But don't worry, says Kamala Harris. The administration has ways of fixing the spike in energy prices. They've got it under control because it turns out Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of global energy markets. 

No, just kidding. Harris has no idea what a barrel of oil costs. She doesn't know how natural gas is measured. What she knows about is diversity, and that's pretty much it. Though she does sense that everything is about to get a lot more expensive for you. And so to warn you, she mentioned it today. 

So, what are the principles were defending here? We're defending a regime that has arrested their main rival and shut down opposition media. What principles are at stake here, apart from rewarding the Biden family's patron? 

But at least she's honest enough to say what's happening in Eastern Europe quote may relate to energy costs. That's a euphemism for: Good luck filling your truck this August. Does that bother Kamala Harris? Maybe it does in the short term. Voters aren't going to like it in November. The party will be punished. 

But they're doing it anyway. They're shutting down domestic energy pipelines here. They're picking a fight with Europe's biggest gas supplier. So maybe there's something bigger at work here. Maybe they're thinking long-term. Maybe they're not against rising oil and gas prices. Maybe there for them. Maybe expensive energy would be good for the many renewable deals their friends and donors are invested in. 

We don't know the answer. We do know that all of us are about to suffer. So we hope that hating Vladimir Putin was worth it.

608	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-america-top-three-goals-russia-ukraine-war	2022-02-24 22:31:00	Tucker Carlson: These should be America's top three goals amid Russia-Ukraine war | Fox News	" Fox News host reacts to Russia waging war on Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

What's happening in Ukraine, whatever its scale, and it's not totally clear right now, but whatever it is, it's a tragedy because war always is a tragedy and the closer you get to it, the more horrifying it seems. It's the ugliest thing that men do. Ever.  

Vladimir Putin started this war so whatever the context of the decision that he made, he did it. He fired the first shots. He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight in Ukraine. The question is, once we've established that and it's obvious, how should the United States respond to what he has done?  

So, within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night, the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy for partisan political gain. If you ever watch the aftermath of the school shooting, you're familiar with how they behave. It's contemptible, but we're going to ignore it tonight because there is too much else going on that actually matters and the main thing that matters in any crisis is deciding what's most important, creating a hierarchy of concern.  

So, until last night, the main purpose of our foreign policy was to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. Obviously, that failed. At some point, we should figure out why. But what's our top goal now? Well, there are several of them. Here are the first three:  

First and most obviously: avoid a full-scale war with a nuclear-armed adversary and to be fair, very few people in Washington want anything like that. War with Russia is so obviously a bad idea. But that doesn't mean we won't have one. Wars often break out accidentally or more often incrementally. Things escalate and the next thing you know, you've got Verdun with many thousands dead. Now that shooting has started in Ukraine, it is entirely possible, no matter what they assure you, that Americans could wind up getting hurt in eastern Europe.  

We should prevent that, but preventing it will require wisdom and farsightedness and emotional control—all of which are never in abundant supply in Washington—and especially now that everyone is justifiably upset. Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we can still make it worse. Mark Warner, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that Russia could be potentially close to triggering what's known as Article Five of the NATO Alliance. That's a collective defense principle. So if Russia were to launch a cyberattack on Ukraine, Warner explained, an attack that affects nearby NATO members like Poland or Lithuania, then possibly every NATO country, including ours, the United States, would be obligated to declare war on Russia. Here he is explaining:  

So Warner's certainly right. That hypothetical that he outlined could happen in the cyberattack on Ukraine could well affect the infrastructure of the eastern European countries. That would be bad. It would be a crime. The civilized world would deplore it. But Article Five is not a mechanical mechanism. Human beings have to decide to invoke it and the question is: Is what the senator just described something that is worth risking a nuclear conflict over? And that is something we should pause very deeply to think about in the most sober possible way, and we hope that our leaders are. 

But not all of them seem sober right now.  Some of them seem reckless and, as usual, ignorant. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for example, spends a lot of time on cable television talking about world affairs. He seems like an expert. And yet, by temperament, he's certainly the last person you want anywhere near a nuclear button. Today, Kinzinger informed us that Russia's seizure of the defunct Chernobyl plant might ""trigger Article Five."" OK, it could be interpreted that way, and then what happens? Clearly, Adam Kinzinger hasn't thought about that. Not for a moment. 

So, you see the problem here. The question is not: Who's at fault? We can say that  is at fault. But then what? And that's the larger problem. Once conflict starts, especially when that conflict is televised, it's really hard to know what happens next. So, anyone who thinks the invasion of Ukraine couldn't become a world war either lacks imagination or is lying to you. It certainly could become a world war. 

So that's the first goal: not making a terrible thing much, much worse. 

Here's the second goal: keep the energy flowing. Cheap energy, we take it for granted, but it is the basis of all we have. No energy, no civilization. Unfortunately, a huge percentage of Europe's energy now comes from Russia and Ukraine. The European Union relies on Russia for roughly 40% of its natural gas. In Germany, which is one of the biggest economies in the world, that percentage is over half. Most of its energy, in the form of natural gas comes from Russia and Ukraine.  

You don't hear that very often on television. This debate is framed exclusively in moral terms, and those are important. We shouldn't ignore them, but they're not the only terms we should consider. The fact is that Vladimir Putin has the power to send Europe and, for that matter, potentially the United States, into an economic depression. Putin has the power to turn off the lights.  

So where did Vladimir Putin get this power? Well, there are a lot of reasons, but a big reason is the climate people gave him this power. Thanks to pressure from zealots like John Kerry, Europe has been shutting down nuclear power plants for years and that's a very confusing strategy. If you're worried about climate, nuclear energy is not the problem. Nuclear energy is the solution. It's reliable. It's domestically produced. It emits no carbon. So, if you were genuinely worried about temperature rises, global warming, you would embrace nuclear energy. But our leaders, and not just ours, globally across the West, have done the opposite. Why? Maybe their donors and families are invested in so-called renewable technologies? Who knows! Whatever the reason, because of a series of very specific decisions made over time, the West is now dangerously dependent on Vladimir Putin for energy.  

Now, our leaders may act like this is not a big deal. It is definitely a big deal and we ought to make decisions based on that fact. 

And finally, a topic no one ever brings up. We must protect the U.S. dollar. America's power derives from its wealth. Rich countries get to do what they want. Poor countries must obey their masters, or they get invaded. We just saw that happen. That is the unchanging rule.  

In this country, control of the U.S. dollar is the key to our wealth. Our entire financialized debt-based economy rests on the unique privilege of issuing the world's reserve currency. If the U.S. dollar is ever replaced, we are in legitimate trouble. Our debt will come due. Our government will go bankrupt and millions of Americans will become poor immediately. So, this is the main thing we ought to be worried about, and it is a greater risk now than ever before.  

Sanctions are an emotionally satisfying way to punish someone like Vladimir Putin, who clearly does deserve to be punished. No one's really against sanctions, but the question is: Do they work? Clearly, multiple sanctions did not prevent the . Let's start there. At the same time, sanctions give Russia and many other countries across the world a strong incentive to dump the U.S. dollar, which is the means by which we enforce sanctions.  

So last summer, for example, in a story that most people didn't pay enough attention to, Russia, in response to sanctions, completely removed the U.S. dollar, its assets from its sovereign wealth fund, its national wealth fund. The Chinese noticed. They understand exactly how this works and in their effort to displace the United States, they are strongly in favor of it. China is trying to become the first major country in the world to central bank-issued sovereign digital currency.  

If that works, and many efforts like it, it would be a huge loss for the United States, an irreplaceable loss that would change this country forever, much more than an invasion of Ukraine. So, we should be watching attacks on the primacy of the U.S dollar globally every bit as intently as we watched the coverage currently on television of the hot war. 

If at the end of this conflict, whenever that is, countries around the world have come to see the Chinese Yuan as a stronger, more stable currency than the U.S. dollar, then this country will have lost more than we understand. Somebody needs to be paying attention to this. Let's fervently hope that somebody is.

609	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-russia-ukraine-defeat-joe-biden	2022-02-26 00:42:00	Tucker Carlson: Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a humiliating defeat for Joe Biden | Fox News	"Tucker told viewers that America has had two historic foreign policy debacles in under a year in Friday's opening monologue. 

We tried to bring you as straightforward an analysis as we could of the invasion of Ukraine yesterday. It was then in progress. It still is. The war at that point was less than 24 hours old, and it seemed disrespectful and wrong to use the deaths of people on the ground as a partisan cudgel. War is horrifying, of course, but it's also a grave and profound thing. You have to stand back and offer a moment before you start drawing convenient conclusions from the suffering you see. Death is a mystery. Acknowledge that. That's how we feel. 

 allies in the media do not feel that way. They use the opportunity to attack their political opponents immediately, as they always do. They have no restraint and no shame. We're grateful not to be them. So that was last night. 

Tonight, it's fair to note the obvious: The invasion of Ukraine is a humiliating defeat for Joe Biden. He's our leader. He staked this country's reputation, billions of dollars and the full force of the U.S. government, on preventing Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine anyway, and America is diminished by that. 

It's not the first time Joe Biden has done something like this. Less than six months ago, Biden oversaw an almost indescribably chaotic withdrawal from . He left American citizens behind. He armed the Taliban with advanced weapons systems on the way out. It could not have been worse. 

So here you have two historic foreign policy debacles in under a year. Is there a precedent for that? What's the message of it? Well, weakness, obviously. Republicans often say that, but as usual, don't go far enough. Weakness? Well, North Korea is weak. They literally have famines. People starve to death in North Korea. That's weakness. But they're still a nation we have to contend with because they bite. 

A venomous spider is weak, you can crush it, but you're still afraid of it because it bites. We do not bite, and that's the problem. We're not simply weak. The United States government under Joe Biden is ridiculous. It's pompous. It's self-involved. It's long-winded and fatuous. It's not so different from the fading old man who leads it. 

There's no hiding this. The rest of the world sees it clearly. So do many Americans, if watching the invasion of Ukraine this week made you feel a little sick, this is probably why. Of course, you felt sorry for the Ukrainians being killed. But you also sense that this was a genuine disaster for us in America. And you're right, it is. 

Joe Biden is quickly draining the reservoir of America's credibility and power that has accumulated over centuries of wise decision-making. Like the U.S. Treasury, this is not Joe Biden's capital to spend. He is squandering something that others made. How much is left at this point? You hate even to think about it. Someday, we're going to find out. 

So the problem here isn't complicated. Joe Biden broke the oldest rule of all: Don't make threats you can't back up. You'd think he would know that if he had actually squared off against Cornpop, but the public swimming pool in Wilmington 60 years ago. But he never did. So he doesn't know that if you say something serious, you had better mean it. Is reckless to tell obvious lies. 

If you do that before long, and it happens very quickly, in fact, people figure out that you can be ignored. You're not a superpower. You're a joke. And that's why you never, under any circumstances, say anything like this: 

Those were statements made just recently, in some cases just days before Vladimir Putin showed precisely how meaningless our sanctions actually were. The greatest sanctions ever, said Kamala Harris, wearing her stupid little mask on Monday. She's a buffoon. You knew that. 

Now it's obvious that her buffoonery is a real peril for the rest of us. No one in the White House seems to understand this. It's life's most obvious lesson. So here is Joe Biden from today telling you that actually, these sanctions the greatest, most deterrent sanctions ever, were never intended really to deter anything. Sorry, if it took us seriously the first time, we didn't really mean it. 

Who gives him these scripts? Do they not think we have access to YouTube? Or maybe they're just hoping Google will scrub it by the time he holds another press conference. You just told us on Monday that the purpose of these sanctions was to deter the invasion of Ukraine. So, at the very least, acknowledge they didn't work as intended. 

They can never acknowledge that. Oh, the vaccine prevents transmission and infection. Just tell the truth. People will understand. But they lie every time. Now they're telling us, Putin knows what's coming. We'll get him next time. Right. 

No one believes you anymore, Joe Biden. No one should believe you. It is very hard to take unserious people seriously. A serious president who cared would have reassessed everything America's foreign policy and how it was administered after the Afghanistan withdrawal last August. That was a disaster. 

So a responsible person would have asked himself: How do we prevent this from happening again? That's how responsible people think. It's our leaders who care about their country's think. Of course, it's the baseline requirement for leadership. This was a disaster. How do we prevent it from happening again? That's not hard. 

But lifetime federal employee that he is, Joe Biden did the opposite of that. His first instinct was to protect the bureaucracy, not the country, the bureaucracy. So not a single person from the Pentagon or the State Department was fired or even reprimanded. In fact, famously, the only person who was punished in the end for that historic debacle was a marine colonel who complained about it. He went to jail for complaining. And you will see the same response this time after the disastrous invasion of Ukraine. The American officials who so publicly trashed this country's credibility will be promoted for it. They always are. 

Victoria Nuland is one of the geniuses behind the Iraq War that was almost 20 years ago. Does that hurt her career? It should have, should have ended her career, in place right then. Go do something useful. Learn how to lay tile. But it didn't end your career, in fact, your career accelerated. In fact, this same person, Victoria Nuland, went on to help lead the Ukraine debacle we're watching now. 

She's completely unqualified for the job she has. We knew that 20 years ago. And yet she's highly successful in Washington. Some day she'll probably be the secretary of state. Remember her name, Victoria Nuland. She'll be rewarded for failing. Meanwhile, people who criticize Victoria Nuland or who care enough about this country to critique Joe Biden's foreign policy disasters, find themselves denounced the media as, of all things, traitors to America, and then spied on by the NSA. 

You see how that works? It's all self-protection, and because it is, only buffoonery is rewarded. And that's exactly why John Kerry is still around. John Kerry told the BBC in public on camera that the real victim of this war is something called ""the climate."" 

And of course, he flew private to that interview, hoping nobody noticed, not caring if anyone noticed. What is the explanation behind that? How could you say something like that? That clip is real. We didn't make it up. It's hard to believe it, but it is real. It's all real. 

If you did a nationwide search for the people least capable of leading a large nation through complicated times, you would get our leadership class. You would get John Kerry. Oh, we found him. The search is over. And of course, at the very top of that list would be John Kerry's friend, Hillary Clinton. 

Hillary Clinton revealed the real story she's telling you that the actual enemy in this war is not in Russia, not eastern Ukraine. It's not Vladimir Putin. It's you. The real enemy of this country is anyone who dares to criticize the mismanagement of Hillary Clinton and her friends. 

Your opinions are the real threat to democracy. Dare criticize us, and we will denounce you as a dangerous traitor because that's democracy. So if Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine? But guess whose fault it is? It's your fault. Notice the theme here? It's always your fault every single time. And they're going to punish you for it. 

Hillary did say one interesting thing in that clip, probably inadvertently. She didn't say it, but the allusion was there. Russia and China are now aligned as a bloc against the United States. Now, how did that happen? It's pretty obvious you're looking around the world, you're thinking, who are the big powers with meaningful economies and nuclear weapons? Maybe they shouldn't be aligned against us. That's just the simplest kind of math. Maybe we shouldn't do anything that pushes our enemies into a bloc. Because that threatens us. 

But they don't know that that's happening, or maybe they're in favor of it. God knows what the Biden administration is thinking. 

According to the New York Times, ""The United States met with China over three months to present intelligence, showing Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine and to urge Beijing to help avert war. Chinese officials rebuffed the United States and then shared that information with Moscow."" 

Oh, yeah. So we went to China for help to prevent Putin from invading Ukraine at the very moment that Russia and China were forming a very public alliance against us. Did that really happen? Apparently, it really did happen. How long can this go on? And maybe that's why Biden didn't mention China during his press conference. He gave them our intelligence and they gave it to Putin. Perfect. But don't mention that or you're a traitor.

610	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-how-did-we-get-here	2022-03-01 00:22:00	Tucker: Defense of Ukraine's democracy has led to an erosion of our own | Fox News	" Fox News host gives his take on the U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

No sane American approves of what Russia has done in Ukraine. We certainly don't and we don't know anyone who does.  

On Twitter, you see Democrats pretending that their political opponents are responsible for the invasion and somehow support it. So, Joe Biden and his staff so mismanaged the world that Vladimir  after Biden told us for months he could prevent that from happening, and yet all of it is your fault. So, that's a slanderous lie.  

In this country, virtually everyone understands that the invasion of Ukraine is bad. It's bad for us and for the world and Vladimir Putin is bad too. So, effectively in America, those are settled facts. We can stop debating them. The question is: What do we do next? Vladimir Putin's badness doesn't absolve us of our responsibility to think clearly about how to protect this country and the rest of the free world, in that order.  

In fact, Putin's badness makes wise decision-making in the United States more important than ever and yet at the same time, it makes wise decision-making harder to achieve. It's not easy to see the long view when you're angry. A writer called Tanner Greer wrote a piece this morning, which you should read. It's entitled, ""Pausing at the Precipice."" Greer began by pointing out that Russia has obviously earned our content. Most Americans now despise Vladimir Putin, and that's understandable. They're outraged, but moral outrage is not enough. Moral outrage is not a foreign policy.  

In fact, Greer writes, moral outrage can be counterproductive. It's clarifying, but here's the downside. ""A righteous reaction may be a dangerous one...In the field of power politics, it is outcomes, not intentions, that matter most. Failure to slow down and examine the assumptions and motivations behind our choices may lead to decisions that feel right in the moment, but fail to safeguard our interests, secure our values, or reduce the human toll of war in the long run."" 

Exactly. Nicely put. Another way to express it would be this: Our leaders could easily turn this tragic and volatile moment into a historic disaster. They've done it before. As of tonight, here are the two main things we ought to be worried about going forward: First, and most obviously, this war could get much worse than it already is. We could see many Americans die.  

Joe Biden is telling us he will not commit American troops to Ukraine. Biden also claimed he opposed vaccine mandates. So is he telling the truth? Even if he is telling the truth about his intentions in this case, Biden can't see the future. Biden has no idea what will happen tomorrow or next week, much less next year. Nobody does.  

We do know that already many in Washington are pushing for a hot war with nuclear-armed Russia. They're demanding a no-fly zone over Ukraine. That means American forces would shoot down Russian jets in Ukrainian airspace and also take out radar installations and other facilities within Russia itself. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on board with this. Why wouldn't he be? He's asked Joe Biden for an American-enforced no-fly zone, but as we said, many in Congress are for it, too. Here's Adam Kinzinger: 

""We can shut down Russian air operations even if we don't directly engage Russian troops on the ground."" So that's a lie. It's hard to overstate how dishonest Kinzinger's claim is. Shooting down Russian planes and taking out radar installations would, by definition, entail engaging Russian troops. If Vladimir Putin is even half as evil and crazy as they tell us he is, and he may be, that could easily spiral into nuclear conflict. 

 So, you would only suggest that if you had nothing to lose and Adam Kinzinger, of course, he doesn't. His political career is over. He's disgraced. He has literally nothing to lose. But many of us have a lot to lose—our country. We have children. So, we should pause before we do that, but no pausing allowed.  

Adam Kinzinger thinks you're a traitor if you're worried about where this might go. ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind-blowing,"" Kinzinger wrote over the weekend— nothing bad will happen. And maybe nothing bad will happen, but something very bad could happen, and it could happen fast.  

Adults know that. Anyone with experience knows that. Watch any war in history. And yet tonight, amazingly some of those adults, and they are adults, favor this anyway. Two former Supreme allied commanders of NATO, Wes Clark and Philip Breedlove are pushing for armed confrontation with the Russian military.

 In an interview with Foreign Policy Magazine, Breedlove was honest enough to acknowledge that a no-fly zone would amount to ""an act of war,"" and it would. Thank you for saying so out loud, but Breedlove said he's for it anyway. OK, so this is the moment when a functioning news media would step in and start to ask basic questions about what happens next. War with Russia, fine.  

What does that mean, exactly? How far is the United States and its population, who would fight that war, prepared to take this conflict and to what end? Once we start bombing Russia, will Putin withdraw his forces from Ukraine? What will be left of Ukraine by that point? How are we sure that Putin, who we say is deranged, won't go nuclear if a war with him begins? And then, among many other questions, what will China's role in this war be?  

Thanks to the efforts of the Biden White House, China is now Vladimir Putin's strongest ally. The Chinese have just signed a long-term energy deal with Russia. They now have skin in the game. Russia will be powering China's economy going forward. Good job, Biden White House. But because that's true, how sure we that the Chinese will stay out of a war?  

How do we know they won't take down our digital infrastructure, which they seem to some great extent to control in this country… etc? You can think of many questions, but reporters aren't asking any of them. Asking questions is now immoral. Richard Engel, who knows better, he's the chief foreign correspondent at NBC, is now demanding that American troops fight the Russian army. It's a moral imperative.  

""A massive Russian convoy is about 30 miles from Kyiv, the US/NATO could likely destroy it, but that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk everything. Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?"" 

And of course, the answer is implied. We can't watch in silence. That would be immoral. If you're a good person, you will support a war that could very easily turn into a nuclear conflict. Again, this is moral blackmail. No one in America takes pride at the sight, feels anything but revulsion at the sight, of Russian troops within Ukraine. It's wrong. It's destabilizing to the world. It is, in fact, against our values, but how we respond is the question. Thoughtfully, has to be the answer unless we're prepared to risk massive consequences.  

Now Richard Haass, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, would under normal circumstances, be exactly the man you would go to for a wise and reasoned perspective on what to do next. That's his job. Whatever you think of the Council on Foreign Relations, and we don't think much, they're not a radical organization. Their job is to think through the consequences of action. But not anymore. Richard Haass is foursquare in favor of a hot war with Russia. He's calling for ""regime change in Moscow"" because no doubt they'll greet us as liberators. What could go wrong? Here's Richard Haass: 

When did a guy that irresponsible take over the Council on Foreign Relations? And of course, that's not his real job, the Council on Foreign Relations, his real job is being a cable news pundit, and that's kind of the problem with the level of discourse around this war. The problem is that when real people with jobs that convey actual authority start talking like cable news guests, things could go sideways very fast. ""Dead Russian soldiers."" 

So it's hardly a defense of Vladimir Putin to point out once again that a shooting war with Russia could have massive consequences for us because it's not just Russian soldiers who would die. Americans would die too, potentially many of them. And, by the way, it's not all certain we would win that war. Sorry, it's not. Ask anyone who's familiar with the current state of readiness of the U.S. military. Is victory a foregone conclusion? Is this the roll into Baghdad? No, it's not. This is not Saddam Hussein we're talking about.  

So again, the point is, are we ready for all of this? We're moving down a path that could result in the destruction of the United States. Americans may be mad at Putin, understandably, but they're wary of where our leaders are taking this next. A new CNN poll, for example, shows a strong majority of Americans, speaking of democracy, oppose direct military action against Russia. Are they all traitors? Are they all pro-Putin? Probably not.  

At the very least, they would like, and we could use, a sober national conversation about the potential consequences of where people like Richard Haass are taking us now. That's the opposite of what we're getting. Instead, we're getting buffoons like Adam Kinzinger sitting in his office making bellicose noises on social media. Just the other day, Kinzinger posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian Air Ace called the Ghost of Kyiv. He downed Russian MiGs left and right.  

Well, turns out the whole thing was a hoax, but of course, Adam Kinzinger had no idea because he knows nothing. ""The #ghostofKyiv has a name and he has absolutely owned the Russian Air Force,"" he tweeted. Imagine a sitting member of Congress tweeting about a war like it's a cable news segment.  

""He absolutely owned the Russian Air Force."" Really? Get some respect. People are dying, buffoon. Kinzinger then attached an obviously photoshopped image of the comedian, Sam Hyde, sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Sam Hyde, for the record, is not a Ukrainian fighter...he is, once again, a comedian. That was Adam Kinzinger. These are the people pushing us toward a new world war.  

So, at the very least, let's pause and think this through. That seems fair and as we do that, it is also worth considering what's happening here in the United States, concurrent with this war and justified by this war and by that, we are speaking of the assault on civil liberties now underway. It would be ironic if a defense of democracy, on the other side of the world, led to an erosion of democracy here and yet that seems to be where we're heading. 

You'll notice that the moment that Russian troops rolled across the border into Ukraine, Democrats wasted no time in attacking not just Putin, but their political opponents in this country. What did they have to do with it? Isn't war the moment for unity? We're all in this together, but they leverage this war and the human suffering that inevitably entails to make partisan points.  

One MSNBC regular, in one of the stranger moments you'll see on television (MSNBC has had a lot of those recently) said the whole conflict was the result of a plot engineered by Vladimir Putin's mole, who happened to be the former president of the United States.  

OK, so we spent maybe three years holding up the lunacy of the Russiagate people and the lying as evidence that maybe they shouldn't have a meaningful effect on our national conversation about politics and yet somehow, through a very unfortunate confluence of events, those very same unbalanced people are now having a measurable effect on our foreign policy and if you think we're overstating the lunacy, try to follow the logic here. This is what she just told us.  

So Donald Trump, that would be Putin's man in the White House, tells Europe not to become dependent upon Russian oil, as he did, and to pay more for their own military defense, which he also did and was scoffed at, by the way. And yet, for some reason, Putin then waits to invade Ukraine until his man in the White House is gone and playing golf in Florida and now it is Donald Trump's fault that Europe is dependent on Russia for energy. It was all part of Putin's plan. Republicans wanted this to happen all along.  

You can imagine MSNBC viewers, the ones sat through years of this, nodding along ""yes."" Now the pee tape makes sense. What's scary about this is that it's not confined to MSNBC. The overlap between MSNBC guests shouting nonsensical partisan talking points and true conspiracy theories and Democratic policy-makers is profound. So Democratic lawmakers now pretending there's a large and dangerous fifth column in the United States working for Vladimir Putin, which there is not. And as always, they're talking about themselves.  

Eric Swalwell, for example, he recently took the maximum possible campaign donation from a lobbyist for Nord Stream 2 AG. Now that's the company making the pipeline that will give Russia greater control over Europe's energy grid and from which the Russian government profits.  

So. Eric Swalwell is taking money from the Russians and by the way, this is a guy who had sex with a Chinese spy. Has he had sex with Russian spies? We don't know, but you'll notice the one guy who probably shouldn't be calling other people traitors, as he takes money from Russian energy interests, is whipping around and accusing everyone else of rooting for the Russians. 

You know, it's such an awful thing to say. We hesitated even to play that. It's very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn't make sense, but it makes political sense. It is an effort to cover their own tracks. Our Foreign policy establishment failed to constrain Vladimir Putin.  

To bring you back to ancient history like a week ago, they were telling us that sanctions and arming the Ukrainian military would prevent a Russian invasion. Now, they were wrong about that. They've been wrong many times, most recently in Afghanistan and in fact, now that we're casting blame, if there is any single American who deserves scorn and yes, blame for the invasion of Ukraine, it would be  

Of course, it was his job, self-described job, to prevent it. But of course, they won't admit that. Instead, they're attacking you and they're doing it with partisan goals in mind. Democrats plan to use the Ukraine invasion, this would become very obvious in the last three days, in the very same way they used January 6th.  

So bad event takes place. No one really is for it. No one defended the riot on January 6th. We certainly didn't. But history is written immediately for partisan ends. So then you take the hysteria ginned up over that event, some of it legitimate, by the way, people have a right to be upset, and you use that to purge the country of the Democratic Party's political opponents. 

So what do they really hate? Well, listen to them. They hate populist politics. They hate populist politics in this country far more than they hate Vladimir Putin. So they're using this opportunity, this war in Eastern Europe, to shut down domestic dissent in the United States and you're seeing it as always in our allies first.  

Several of them, including Canada, have banned journalists who don't agree with their view of the war. Again, if we're going to protect democracy, that should start at home and democracy is defined, literally defined, by the tolerance of the regime for dissent. But no dissent is allowed. So they've pulled RT off the airwaves in Canada, we did that long ago, and that led Mother Jones Magazine to ask this question today:  

""Both RT and Sputnik air in the United States, too."" Untrue, but whatever they don't know. ""Will Biden follow suit and crackdown on pro-Russia disinformation? If he does, U.S. cable companies will also need to scrutinize media outlets like Fox News, whose shows— Tucker Carlson's in particular— have parodied pro-Russia talking points."".

OK, so Putin invades Ukraine, self-evidently a tragedy bad for the United States, and we're using that as a justification because we care so much about democracy to shut down any news organization, any journalist who questions the Democratic Party? OK. How did we get here anyway? How corroded have these people become that they're calling for government censorship of dissent and telling us their defenders of democracy? That's just the beginning. Anyone who supports voter I.D. laws is a Kremlin agent, too. You're seeing how they're going to use this? Here's Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee to explain:  

You know, it's not even worth parsing the logic of something like that. You can only feel deep sadness that the people you just saw represent you in our Legislature, but by the way, as long as we're punishing people who are allied with hostile foreign interests, just to restate the obvious, China is now Russia's strongest ally in this war and that has real implications for people like, I don't know Nancy Pelosi, whose family has gotten rich from China or the entire American financial sector, or Hollywood, or all the people who are now profiting from . Will they divest of those investments?  

We'll see. But in the meantime, you should be very aware that there are partisan forces trying to use the war in Ukraine to accomplish political objectives here domestically and gain more power for themselves. It's not just about voting rights or shutting down Fox News.  

It's about shutting you up personally, your ability to express yourself and if you doubt that, you should know that Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia just wrote a letter to his donors, the tech monopolies demanding that they, ""restrict the spread of Russian propaganda."" 

He did not define the term ""Russian propaganda"" and as a show that has been accused of disseminating it repeatedly, we can tell you we're all sensitive on the topic and you should be too. So, Warner went on television recently to report that his donors and Big Tech quickly complied with his demand. 

So, contrast that with MSNBC. MSNBC is when dumb people do propaganda and tell you that Russia invading Ukraine is somehow about racism in the American South or something. I mean, it's nonsensical.  

Sen. Mark Warner is when smart people do propaganda. You'll notice that Ignatius said Russian state media or Russian propaganda. To just be completely clear, Warner is not talking about banning Russian state media. He's talking about banning Russian propaganda, a term that he gets to define. He's talking about censoring the opinions of Americans.  

Now, to be clear, that is not allowed in a democracy. In a democracy, citizens who rule have an absolute right to have any opinion they want. Period. That's not an ancillary freedom. That's not just some random thing that we have as an added bonus as Americans.  

That freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, is the central freedom we have. It's the whole point of the country and there is no point in supporting Ukraine if our leaders ignore our own bill of rights, and we should demand that they respect our Bill of Rights before they take a single step forward in defense of any other democracy.

611	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-kamala-harris-europe-worse-disaster	2022-03-03 23:59:00	Tucker: Harris is going back to Europe to see how much worse she can make this disaster | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the Russia-Ukraine war and Vice President Kamala Harris possibly visiting Europe on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Europe just lost a huge percentage of its energy supply, which is not a small thing. We're all being reminded of that. So, this situation appears to become more chaotic by the day, possibly even spinning out of control and that, we must be honest, is shocking to us. We've been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We're not the only ones who were, but we're willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren't. So, why didn't we see this coming, this total loss of control? Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, serious people would be involved in fixing them, but we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved, and that reassured us.  

Harris had just come back from Europe, where she'd been conducting ""diplomacy with our allies,"" and that appeared to be proof this could not really be a big deal. The situation in  had been legitimately serious. If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance as now so obviously it does, of course, the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it because that's not her job. Kamala Harris's job is to trot down to the Blue Room periodically to greet delegations of TikTok influencers or to cut occasional PSAs for the Children's Dental Health Awareness Month, which is in February. So, we assumed she'd be working on that right now. 

But averting war with ? Saving the civilized world? C'mon. That is absolutely not Kamala Harris's job. That was our assumption, but as noted, we were wrong. Why were we wrong? Well, we spend a lot of time watching Kamala Harris. You probably don't. Unless you are a junior producer at MSNBC, you're probably not that familiar with Kamala Harris. We should say, by the way, we didn't underestimate Vladimir Putin. We overestimated Joe Biden, but we knew that once Kamala Harris was involved, it couldn't really be that serious and we knew that because this is what she's like. 

This is just not a serious person, not surrounded by serious people, and yet we are in an extremely serious moment that demands seriousness. Of course, ""we must together, work together"" to see where we are going together, but also see it as a moment together. 

If you've taken peyote, you know what she means, otherwise you're probably baffled. Once again, it's time for us to do what we've been doing and that time is every day. It's like a ... poem, but the illiterate version, impossible to parse. When Kamala Harris speaks, you get the feeling you're either too dumb or too smart to understand what she's saying, but then within a few sentences, you settle firmly on the latter. What are our European allies to think of this? Well, of course, they've come to the same conclusion. 

Less than two weeks ago, as all of this was brewing on the brink, the Biden administration sent that person, Kamala Harris, to represent the United States at the Munich Security Conference in Germany and while she was there, she assured the world that she and Joe Biden had the situation completely under control. Yes, Putin would like to invade Ukraine. Of course he would, but not on her watch, not while Kamala D. Harris was on the same continent, this continent known as Europe. No way. Harris exuded what novelists call a steely resolve.  

Imagine being first in line for a shoe sale on Black Friday. Kamala Harris had that look. She knew what she wanted and she knew where to find it and here's how she expressed that resolve, and yes, this is a verbatim quote from the Munich Security Conference.  

""Perhaps this is a moment, as life does present us with those moments that challenge us, to ask: What is our reason for being? And I think we all know the history of NATO and its reason for being. The spirit behind this term we use, the transatlantic community. The word 'community,' meaning a collection, not a collection of individuals who see themselves as a collection, then as one. And that's where we are now."" 

So, if the vice president of the United States interrupts an adult security conference to talk like that, you conclude that whatever crisis they're talking about at the conference couldn't be imminent. They must have plenty of time to fix it, and that's why they could afford to send Kamala Harris in the first place, because actually, it's not as big a deal as it seems. Clearly the White House must see European heads of state as equivalent to TikTok influencers. This is some kind of photo-op. That's what we concluded. How could we not conclude that? And then there was this clue. The day after Kamala Harris said the words we just read, talked about her reason for being, the day after she said that, she explicitly encouraged Ukraine to join NATO.  

""I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy's desire to join NATO,"" she said that at a press event ... We saw that, we thought obviously the Biden people must have this under control in some way we don't know about. They must have some secret back channel to Putin. They must have been fully assured that saying something so unbelievably inflammatory is not going to push Putin to invade Ukraine. We assume that, I mean, how could it be otherwise? It's the United States. It's a real country. The idea that Ukraine might join NATO obviously causes crisis in the first place, whatever you think of it. We know because we've watched for years, the more Western leaders pushed the idea of Ukraine and NATO, the closer Russians came to invading Ukraine. It's not a defense of that, it's just observation of it. That's true. So obviously, no sane person would say something like that with Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border. You'd have to want an invasion of Ukraine to say something like that and at the time, we didn't think they did want that. So, we got it completely wrong and honestly, we've continued to get it wrong ever since.  

We assumed that once Kamala Harris humiliated the United States in Munich and jeopardized its core interests, that maybe her boss, Joe Biden, would realize maybe borders aren't her thing. Maybe if you want to keep the border between two countries from being violated, maybe you don't send Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris believes borders are racist or something, so obviously it's pretty hard for her to protect borders.  

So, it's always a strange personal choice. Biden has been around a while. You think, you know, the key to good management is matching the person with the job. Not everybody is good at everything. So, if you're looking for someone to date Montel Williams, well, maybe she's the person you would choose. You could be a solid choice that she's done it before. Dating Montel Williams, you know, it's something that's within her range of experience. Is she good at it? We can't say, but she's done it, but this new gig, deescalating a world-ending conflict with a nuclear armed rogue state? No, no, not when nuclear reactors are on fire, but they're doing it anyway, humiliating our country, jeopardizing our safety and the future of the world.

Kamala Harris is now the point person on Ukraine. In diplo speak, she's got the Ukraine portfolio. What's she doing with that portfolio? We'll start at the beginning, explaining things to the American public. If the world economy is going to collapse and you're not going to be able to afford meat for dinner, if Europe's not going to have power, you should probably know why, and it has nothing to do, they assure you, with the criminal negligence of people like Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. No, it's because of a place called Ukraine. Listen.  

If you are patronizing people to that degree in the middle of a crisis this serious, you should not be in a position of leadership. Translation: I've never read a book in my life. I'm assuming you haven't, either. Let's talk. 

""Ukraine is a country in Europe."" Right, OK, following you, Kamala Harris. Can you imagine? Watching this, maybe you're starting to understand what the whole point of this administration is. It's the equity agenda, and under the terms of that agenda, only the least capable are allowed to assume positions of authority in the United States. It's government by the dumbest.  

That's how Pete Buttigieg, a guy who can barely drive his own car, wound up in charge of all of our roads and so all these people got their jobs. It was intentional. Now, Washington has worked this way to some extent for a long time. It's just that under this president, the principle has reached its horrifying, but logical, endpoint. The last president hired Michael Cohen to be his personal lawyer, but the difference is Donald Trump didn't make Michael Cohen the attorney general of the United States.  

Biden absolutely would do that as long as Cohen was transgender, and you know that. So, it shouldn't surprise you, though it should horrify you and make you nervous that, according to The Hill newspaper, Kamala Harris is going back to Europe to see how much worse she can make this disaster. She'll be heading to Warsaw, Poland, and Bucharest, Romania, to ""show solidarity with Ukraine,"" which means to badly damage key American interests in inventive new ways you haven't yet imagined. That's what's going on: a crisis that gets more grave by the day, whose ramifications are clearly more serious than anyone expected, overseen by people who have no wisdom or foresight or restraint and fundamentally don't have the interests of our country at heart when they make their decisions and Kamala Harris isn't the only problem, but she's the most glaring symbol of it.

612	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-we-are-war-russia	2022-03-08 00:35:00	Tucker: We are at war with Russia, whether or not Congress has declared it | Fox News	"Fox News host reflects on the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Yesterday morning, Joe Biden's secretary of state, a man called Tony Blinken, went on to the Sunday show over at CBS News to announce new policy toward Russia. Going forward, Blinken explained, the Biden administration will use Poland as a cutout to send fighter jets to the government of Ukraine. Those jets will be used to fight the Russian military. Blinken announced this in a calm, even tone that suggested this was conventional procedure, business as usual, nothing to worry about, just another weekend at the State Department. But in fact, it's not typical. It's a very big step. It could turn out to be a pivot point in history and for that reason, we want you to know entire exchange. 

""Are you afraid that will escalate tension?,"" asks the scriptwriter, because even a CBS News anchor knows that sending fighter jets to a war usually does that. ""No,"" replies Tony Blinken, ""that gets a green light."" 

It's a remarkable exchange. What are we watching here, apart from a conversation between two incredibly shallow people who have limited contact with reality? What we're watching is the beginning of a war between the United States and . If that sounds jarring, what else would you call it? Now you may support everything that Tony Blinken just said. Maybe you do support it, but let's not lie about what's happening. Let's be as honest and clear-eyed as we can be, especially now, because it matters. The Biden administration just inserted itself with force into the middle of a hot war between two foreign powers. That means the United States is now an active participant in a war. We are at war with Russia. Whether or not that war has been officially declared, whether or not Congress has authorized that war, all of that is irrelevant. That war is happening right now as we watch.  

Why is no one in Washington saying anything about this? Because they support it. They always have. Almost five years ago, way back in 2017, Rep. Eric Swalwell of  came on this show for another Russiagate debate, one of many. He came to let us know how Vladimir Putin had gotten Donald Trump elected president. It was all as stupid as you remember, it until the end of the interview when Swalwell said something odd and interesting. Swalwell explained that because Putin had installed Donald Trump secretly in the White House, the United States should now ""do everything we can to expand NATO's role."" In other words, we should let Ukraine join NATO. That's odd. Why would he say that? Why would a policy so seemingly obscure— NATO, Ukraine, What?— Why would that be a priority for some forgettable congressman from the East Bay?  

Well, simple, because getting Ukraine to join NATO was the key to inciting war with Russia. We didn't get it at the time. Now it's obvious. Vladimir Putin just invaded Ukraine because he didn't want Ukraine to join NATO. Putin certainly had other motives as well. People always do have multiple motives, but that's the main reason Russia invaded. The Russians don't want American missiles on their border. They don't want a hostile government next door.  

Now that's true, whether you're allowed to say it in public right now or not, it has been true for a long time. A lot has been written about this over many years by serious people. No one who knows anything and is honest will tell you Putin invaded Ukraine simply because he is evil. Putin may be evil. He certainly seems to be, but he also has strategic motives in doing that, whether or not you agree with those motives, that's irrelevant. Those are the facts. So, with those facts in mind, the Biden administration's behavior in the days before the Ukraine invasion tells you a lot about what motivated them.  

With Russian troops amassed by the thousands on the Ukrainian border, Joe Biden sent Kamala Harris, the least capable diplomat in Washington, to explain America's policy to European heads of state. At a public press event at the Munich Security Conference, Kamala Harris encouraged Ukraine to become a member of NATO. ""I appreciate and admire President Zelenskyy's desire to join NATO."" Message: Up yours, Vladimir Putin, go ahead and invade Ukraine. And of course, Vladimir Putin did that just days later.  

So, the invasion was no surprise to the Biden administration. They knew that would happen. That was the point of the exercise. We watched all this happen. We missed it. How? Honestly, because it was insane and therefore very hard to take seriously. Why in the world would the United States intentionally seek war with Russia? How could we possibly benefit from that war? We still don't know the answer to that question, but it is obvious that permanent Washington has been fixated on war with Russia for a very long time.  

A couple of years ago, you may remember, we'd forgotten, they impeached a sitting president. Why? For threatening to withhold military aid to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Failing to back a proxy war in Ukraine was the one thing Donald Trump was not allowed to do as president. Again, they impeached him for it and no one said much about it, even in his own party, because, of course, they supported war with Russia too— maybe even more than the Democrats did. As far back as 2016, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina— hysterical little Lindsey Graham— was jumping around, acting out his war fantasies in front of foreign soldiers in Ukraine. If we saw this tape at the time, we don't remember seeing it - back in 2016, Ukraine seemed like a faraway place. We should have paid more attention. 

""Your fight is our fight."" That's a very strange thing for an American lawmaker to say to a foreign military. Why would the Ukrainian government's fight in 2016 possibly be our fight? On what grounds is it our fight? What does that even mean? We don't know. And yet now it is demonstrably true. Ukraine's fight is our fight. Ukraine's war is our war. It's here, but most Americans did not see that coming—yet permanent Washington certainly did. Permanent Washington understood that the second Vladimir Putin's forces rolled across the border into Ukraine we would inevitably be on a course toward war with Russia. They knew. Here's the president of the August Council on Foreign Relations on the day of the invasion.  

""Dead Russian soldiers."" At the time, that seemed a little bellicose right out of the gate. It had just happened. Maybe there's some way to deescalate this. The invasion is terrible, but isn't America's role as steward of the West to make things better? Wouldn't a prompt Russian withdrawal from Ukraine be the wisest course for everyone, including and especially the Ukrainians on whose behalf we claim to speak, but whose country would be leveled by a protracted war? You would think so, but that's not what anyone in Washington wanted. They wanted a war and now they have one.  

So, where's this going? That's the question for the rest of us who had no role in making these decisions. Well, it's worrisome. You should keep in mind that the U.S. government is currently run by the same people who planned the Afghanistan withdrawal, the ones who tanked the U.S. dollar, the people who run Baltimore, the ones who tried to send crack pipes to junkies, these are people with a long history of destroying things and no history at all of building anything. So, a lot could go wrong.

They tell us that Vladimir Putin is unbalanced. We'll take that at face value. We know that Putin has thousands of nuclear weapons. Putin has said that if he is pushed, he will use nuclear weapons. It could be wise to believe him.  

Harry Kazianis does believe him. Kazianis is a foreign policy analyst in Washington. Like a lot of people in his business, he regularly participates in government-sponsored war games. These are designed to map out what would happen if various countries fell into conflict with one another. A couple of years ago, not long ago at all, Kazianis participated in a war game predicated on a war with Russia.  

He wrote about this the other day in The Federalist. ""In the course of what we call the NATO-Russia War of 2019, we estimated one billion people died."" One billion. ""And if we aren't careful, what happened in a simulation could happen if a NATO-Russia war erupts over Ukraine."" 

That war has just erupted. The fact that no one in charge seems to worry about where this could go should concern you quite a bit, but nuclear war is not the only risk. The economic consequences of this war are already profound. They're history changing, actually and if you don't believe it, check out commodity prices. They're out of control. Wheat is up nearly 60% over last year. That's the highest price ever recorded for wheat. It's not good news if you plan to eat and it won't get better. Russia is one of the largest fertilizer producers in the world. So, for example, a ton of Urea fertilizer that cost American farmers $265 per ton last January now goes for $846 this year. And thanks to sanctions, that number will get much higher. No one who farms has ever seen anything like this. You probably don't farm, but you do buy groceries. It'll be obvious to you soon.  

In fact, thanks to Biden's foreign policy, everything you buy is shooting up in price and shockingly fast. Gasoline is now higher than it's ever been in the history of gasoline. In Los Angeles, it is selling for $7.29 a gallon. So if you make under $100,000 a year and most people in this country do, that qualifies as a crisis for you, but for the people in charge, it's not high enough. They'd like to make it worse. Their latest idea, that a lot of people seem to be buying, is that we have a moral obligation somehow to stop buying Russian oil. It's tainted. 

OK. What would happen if we did that? Well, needless to say, oil prices would jump likely to over a $150 a barrel, even higher prices for you, but then if that boycott spread and moral boycotts tend to and Europe joined it, buckle your seatbelt.  

We talked to someone in the energy business this morning, energy traders, to get a little perspective on this. He said a total boycott of Russian energy would cause ""an absolute global disaster."" That means recession, depression, uncontrollable inflation and the rest—economic devastation to us and our allies. And at that point, in fact, we're already there, we'd be forced to make up the difference by getting more oil from other countries because we need the energy. Batteries aren't going to supply it. So what would those countries be? Well, let's see. They would be pretty clear: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela. 

To repeat, in order to wage a moral boycott, we become more dependent on Saudi Arabia, governed by Sharia law; Iran, a rogue state; and Maduro's Venezuela because this is a moral statement we're making. This is a moral victory so feel good about it as you go bankrupt. That's the short term picture. The long term picture of war with Russia is even scarier than that. Thanks to Biden's policies, Russia and China now form a bloc against the United States. This was the nightmare scenario, now it's real. Just today, the Chinese foreign minister described Vladimir Putin as China's ""most important strategic partner."" So are we going to see a boycott of Chinese goods in the United States? They're making this war possible. Oh, don't bet on it, that would be racist.  

But we should prepare to lose our position as holder of the world's reserve currency. That is happening in slow motion. It's unmistakable. Now the Biden people seem to have no idea this is going on, or maybe they want it to happen. Joe Biden was up there at the State of the Union bragging about how he took 30 points off the Russian ruble in a single day. Hurray! Good for us, but once we stop celebrating our win, the destruction of the Russian economy, they deserve it, you got to wonder, is there a downside to this? Could it be a pyrrhic victory? Let's see. These policies have driven Russia, China, India, Turkey and other countries to accelerate their flight from the U.S. dollar.  

Now, to be clear, that's the majority of the global economy. This may be the most reckless and destructive thing any American president has ever done to the United States. If the war in Ukraine ended tomorrow, we would live with the consequences of that loss of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency for the rest of our lives. 

No one in Washington is even acknowledging this is happening. They're looking for more moral victories to win. And the companies love it, the woke companies, Apple, MasterCard, lots of other American companies, are taking victory laps for their role in punishing Russia. Great. Punish Russia. We're not against that, but you've got to wonder. You've just seen a handful of woke corporations crash a country and impoverished its citizens indiscriminately. Now that country is Russia, so most of us aren't even thinking about the precedent it sets. We're fine with it. It's Russia. Who cares? 

But is it possible these same techniques might be used someday against someplace or somebody that you care about? What if one morning you woke up and they decided that you're Vladimir Putin and you must be erased? Could that happen? Don't think about it. You probably aren't able to think about it clearly right now, even if you try. Why? Because there's a moral panic in progress.  

For the record, this is the third moral panic we have had in the United States of America in less than two years. You don't want to live in a country in which moral panics break out regularly, by the way. Moral panics diminish the people engaged in them and hurt the people who don't. They're degrading. They're crazy. They're the opposite of what you want. You want to live in a country where wisdom and restraint and rational behavior and decency determine the outcomes, not screaming. But we live in a country of moral panics.  

The first one began in May of 2020 with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. That changed America completely. The second moral panic was . You've lived through that. So for nearly two years, the shouting has not ended. Hysteria is now the official language of public discourse in the United States. That's not good for anyone, except those benefiting from it. Who is benefiting? Anyone who lies for a living. The liars have perfect cover. Ask yourself: How much of what you first heard about BLM, and then about the coronavirus turned out in the end to be true? How many of the first stories were true? Not many. It was almost all lies, but you didn't know that at the time because you were busy being yelled at. If you dared to point out that actually all lives matter, they denounced you as a racist. If you expressed concern about vaccine mandates, of course, they called you an anti-vaxxer.  

Sound familiar? The pattern never changes. Hey, maybe war with Russia is not a good idea for the United States. Say that out loud some time. It's not an extreme position. Most Americans would agree with you, but you will immediately be denounced as a tool of Putin. What is this? It's name-calling as a means of social control. The people in charge have decided their primary job is to decide who you should hate. In an environment like this, everything feels like propaganda and that's because much of it is.  

On Thursday, we told you that Russian forces had bombed a nuclear reactor in Ukraine. That seemed to be true. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine had said it repeatedly, but it was not true. No reactors were hit. An unnamed Ukrainian official claimed that radiation levels in the area had risen. That turned out to be untrue as well. In the words of Mark Nelson, who is a nuclear energy analyst, ""I'm afraid to say, this looks like a coordinated effort to induce panic."" Of course. It was what we call disinformation and it was designed to get you to support a war against Russia. Now, maybe you support a war against Russia anyway, but you should at least know that you're being lied to and manipulated, which you are. Read this from Good Morning America the other day: 

Miss Ukraine with a rifle defending her homeland. Is there anything more inspiring than that? It would be more inspiring if it was real. It wasn't. It was fake. Miss Ukraine was not defending her homeland. That wasn't a rifle. It was an airsoft gun. So the whole thing was not a news story, though you read it as such. It was a propaganda shoot. It was meant to deceive you. It was meant to make you want war with Russia. Sympathize with one side over the other. 

It works. That's why they do it. It's why the tech companies have censored so many news sites recently, including from Russia, but not exclusively from Russia. Now we're supposed to think this is a victory over Putin or something, but a victory for what? Less information? Fewer perspectives? If getting to the truth was the point of the exercise, we as American citizens would be able to read whatever we wanted to read. That was the rule for centuries in this country. It no longer is because truth is no longer the point.  

Instead, Twitter and Facebook are proudly censoring any information that might ""undermine trust in Ukrainian government."" Really? Since when are we required to trust the Ukrainian government or any government? Don't ask. 

By the way, over the weekend, because everything in America is unintentionally hilarious now, the New York Times attacked  for censorship. Turns out he engaged in censorship and tries to control his people can read.  

Lost in the relentless focus on war in Ukraine, by the way, is any perspective about the world or war, which is always lacking in D.C., but never more so than now. The fighting in Ukraine is terrible, of course, you're seeing it happen. No decent person could fail to be moved by the images, but it's not unique. It's not the only war in recent memory or even currently in progress right now.  

Many thousands died in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war that was between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ever heard of it? It ended less than a year and a half ago. No coverage. There's been a gruesome war underway in Ethiopia for a couple of years now. It's n progress as we speak. Tens of thousands, women have been raped by militiamen, many of them intentionally infected with AIDS. Can it get worse than that? How many people have died in the war in Ethiopia? We don't really know, because no one in our media cares enough to keep track. It's just Ethiopia. We do know that hundreds of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died in the war in Yemen. It's a war the Biden administration has continued to fund. It doesn't get a lot of attention. It's just Yemen. Who cares?  

All human life is equal. All of us are equal in the eyes of God. The death of someone in Ukraine is exactly equivalent to the death of someone in Yemen in its importance, period.

But hardest of all to ignore, though our media have pulled it off and ignored it, is the civil war that's underway 100 hundred yards from El Paso, Texas, right now: the Mexican drug war. That's what we call it. It's likely killed more than 100,000 people.  

In 2019 alone, close to 10,000 Mexican citizens just disappeared, most of them young men. More journalists are murdered in Mexico every year than in any other country in the world. The pictures are awful, but it's not a crisis. It's totally normal, says the Biden administration. Open the southern border. The border we care about is Ukraine's.  

Now, Republicans in Washington, to their eternal shame, have no problem with any of this. In fact, many of them are more for war with Russia than Joe Biden seems to be. That is a disgrace. It will hurt them in the midterms. It will hurt them on some deeper level because it does not serve the interests of this country, a war fought on behalf of democracy that ignores the will of the country fighting it? At some point soon, we'll explain exactly what's going on here, but it's enough to know Republicans are not representing their voters when they move to a position that's way more warlike than Joe Biden's, when they embrace the lunacy that could really hurt this country, that aren't representing people like Bryce Mitchell. Bryce Mitchell seems like a Republican voter. He's a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter. He is a cattle farmer from Cabot, Arkansas. The other day, someone asked him what he thought about Ukraine at a press event. Here's what he said: 

Tell us how he's a Putin stooge, Lindsey Graham and David Frum and Anne Applebaum, Liz Cheney. Tell us how he's immoral. When the war comes to Arkansas, he said, ""I will dig my boots into the ground and I will die for everything I love."" That's the American position. Fight to the death to defend what you love, your people, your family, your country, to defend it. That's why we call it the Defense Department. It is not called the Department of Nation Building or the Bureau of Trans Evangelism. Bryce Mitchell may not have good grammar, but he understands exactly what's going on here, even if the people who claim to represent him and our country have no idea.

613	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-its-hard-remember-betrayal-this-scale	2022-03-08 23:18:00	Tucker: Biden's response to the Russia-Ukraine war further proves he hates the middle class | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to Biden banning Russian oil and natural gas imports on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You may have noticed that Joe Biden announced today a new front in his ongoing war against America's middle class. Biden didn't frame it that way, of course, Democrats rarely say what they mean. They tell you it's about something else. 

In this case,  told us it was about Vladimir Putin. Biden explained that we're going to hurt Putin by making it illegal for Americans to buy Russian energy. This, he said, will amount to a massive moral victory for us. We're going to feel great about ourselves. And at the same time, it will be a crushing defeat for the Russians who of course, deserve it.  

So, it's one of those rare occasions when we could see the good guys win and the bad guys lose. Hurray. Around Washington, you could almost hear the feverish applause as Biden finished speaking. Every constituency loved it. The media agreed that Joe Biden had never seemed more presidential. Democratic officials seemed deeply relieved. For once, they could talk about something other than COVID and the southern border. They'd rather be on offense than defense.  

Republican leaders, meanwhile, seemed happiest of all. They barked like seals. Finally, a chance to sound tough and decisive without making CNN angry. Thank you, Joe Biden. We can all be John McCain now. You rarely see unity like this in a city as divided as Washington. The unity was so heady, in fact so delightful and intoxicating, that no one remembered to ask the most basic question: Why exactly are we doing this? What's the point? Is the point to bankrupt Vladimir Putin? That might be worth doing, but this won't do it.  

 already has ready markets around the world for his oil, starting in China, in India and Turkey. So that's not going to work. Maybe the point is to force Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraine. That would definitely be worth doing, but no, that's not the point, either. Joe Biden will typically say absolutely anything, but even Joe Biden didn't claim today that sanctioning Russian oil will end the war in Ukraine because it won't.  

So, who exactly are these sanctions aimed at? Think about it. If you want to identify the target of a penalty, consider who's going to suffer most from it. And in this case, the answer could not be clear. It's middle-income Americans. They're the ones who were crushed for two years under COVID restrictions. They're the ones who are about to be pummeled by shutting down more energy sources. Notice a theme here? The people in charge hate the middle class above all. So, it's not Vladimir Putin who's getting punished, it's American citizens. It's you. It's not speculation.  

Gas prices are already the highest they have ever been in history and they're about to get even higher—potentially much, much higher. So will the price of natural gas and the price of electricity and food and everything else you buy that has to be transported more than 100 yards from where it was made, which is to say every single thing in your life. This is not good news for you, no matter what Washington is currently claiming. You are about to get a lot poorer. That's guaranteed. You'll notice as you read this that is the one thing that somehow Joe Biden forgot to mention today.  

So, lying by omission is pretty simple. You just don't mention the truth. You heard Biden do that just there, but it takes something else very different—whether it's chutzpah, delusion or senility or whatever else, explains Joe Biden's behavior - It takes something like that to tell a lie like the one you just read at the end of Biden's statement, ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production."" 

Oh, but it simply is true. It's demonstrably true and everyone knows it. On his first day in office, Biden single-handedly killed the Keystone XL Pipeline. Then, just days before  invaded Ukraine, weirdly, Biden's administration shut down all new energy leases and permits on federal land. That happened. Vladimir Putin did not do that. Joe Biden did it. Biden's publicist tried to explain that actually preventing domestic energy production, which they have done, is very different from holding back domestic energy production.  

""Let me give you the facts here."" Now, when they say that, you know the lies are coming and indeed, in this case, they arrived promptly. Because oil companies have not used all the permits they've received, Jen Psaki told us, that means this is their fault. They're not trying hard enough to produce energy. They could, but they don't want to. But wait a second, Jen Psaki. What if there's no oil or gas underneath the permitted land? In that case, energy producers would want permits for land where the energy is. Turns out they don't want dry wells. They want wells that flow, but they're not getting them thanks to the Green New Deal lobby that completely controls this administration, they can't get those permits. And that's what's happening here and if you doubt it, ask anyone who works in the energy business.  

Jen Psaki just lied to you. They are all lying to you. You probably guessed that already, but you can't say it because if you wonder what these policies may be doing to your country or to your family, you are selfish and disloyal. In fact, you're unpatriotic because real patriotism is caring about Ukraine first. And by the way, caring about Ukraine means prolonging a bloody war on Ukraine until the entire country of Ukraine has been destroyed and millions of Ukrainians are refugees.  

We know we can do because we did it in Iraq. We can do it in Ukraine. That's patriotism. Once you spell it out, it all sounds kind of complicated, so we're going to hand it over to our late-night moral leader Stephen Colbert to explain:  

Well, it turns out a guy who makes $16 million a year is willing to pay a little more for gas if that's the right thing to do. He's willing to make that sacrifice, because that's the kind of caring, decent man Stephen Colbert is. Now it's true, as you just heard, that he doesn't actually use gasoline. He drives a $150,000 electric car, but he will do it anyway. He's the kind of man who will take you out to dinner and let you pay, and at the end, he'll let you leave a big tip because he cares about the server.  

Sometimes, as Stephen Colbert reminds us, life is about making tough moral choices and that's especially true now. If at the end of this project, this protracted exercise and social reorganization achieved through COVID plus a war with Russia, if at that point, whenever it is, we no longer have a self-sufficient middle class, if people who make under $100,000 a year are more desperate and demoralized and dependent on government than they've ever been, if the only Americans who remain truly free at that point are the oligarchs, well, at least we can say we helped democracy.  

When Mark Zuckerberg controls everything in America, you will know it's a truly democratic system. Justin Trudeau understands this. He ran over members of his middle class with horses because that's what it took to preserve democracy in Canada. And then he went further. He seized truckers’ bank accounts and then he shut down a coffee shop that serves people who didn't vote for him. That's what democracy looks like. 

Elizabeth Warren was excited when she saw this kind of democracy at work. Warren knows that if we're going to preserve democracy in America, if we're going to fight Russia, then Elizabeth Warren is going to need fingertip control of your family's finances now and always. And by the way, don't try and hide anything from Elizabeth Warren, say, in cryptocurrency, because if you do, Elizabeth Warren will know you are working for Vladimir Putin.  

Here's an idea: Let's keep dumb people and crazed partisan demagogues away from our financial system and our power grid. They can keep the sociology department. Have fun. But why don't you stay away from the fundamentals that keep the country running? How's that sound? That was the arrangement for decades, but no longer. You must submit to total personal control by irresponsible lunatics like Elizabeth Warren or you can serve Russia, as she put it, ""you can't do business in both."" And by the way, you better not complain about this. Good Americans love higher gas prices. They love suffering for a cause they don't understand. CNN looked into it and that's what they found. 

It turns out Americans are delighted to be poor and helpless. They love it because poverty means holding Russia accountable, not Putin's poverty, that's not going to happen, your poverty. 

Well, how exactly does your poverty hold Putin accountable? CNN didn't ask that question, but the polling company Rasmussen did ask. That's what they do. They asked this question, ""If a wider war breaks out in Europe, should the US military be involved?"" Pretty simple question. 

The answer was not simple, though. The answer varied by income. This may not surprise you. The people who actually fight our wars, the people making under $30,000 a year were overwhelmingly opposed to this war. Only 37% of them supported military action, and then it changed going up.  

The richer and more cut off from physical reality people got, the more ardently they supported war with Russia, and it turns out that's the subset you see. Those are the people on television, the people with fake jobs and inherited money. They're totally for it, and they’re for it because they are going to pay no cost, but they'll still get to feel virtuous about promoting it. Then they'll tune in to Stephen Colbert at night with a clean heart. As for the Americans who will do the actual fighting and then the suffering here at home, they don't count. Because in a democracy you can safely ignore the middle class and so our leaders are doing that. 

They don't care about you at all. They have complete contempt for you and your interests. Notice, they don't even bother to apologize to you for what they're about to do to you and your family, which will change your life. We're not overstating it. 

Now, who are they? The first two men were Democrats. The third was Lindsey Graham. We'll let you decide what he is, apart from utterly loathsome, obviously, but we have to tell you that virtually every elected Republican in Washington, D.C. is fully on board with this, which is another way of saying they are totally committed to screwing their own supposed constituency, which would be America's shrinking, desperate middle class. Those are the people who vote Republican and this is what they get in return. No apology. Shafted.  

It's hard to remember a betrayal at this scale and yes, we have been here before, by the way, we've been in conflicts with Russia for a long time. The United States traded with the Russians through the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union and United States had nuclear weapons pointed right at each other and we worried one might go off. We traded with Joseph Stalin in the middle of his terror at the very moment he was murdering four million, yes, Ukrainians. That happened. And then we armed Stalin. 

We armed the Soviet Army as he was killing Ukrainians and the New York Times endorsed all of it. But now, because Putin invaded Ukraine, effectively encouraged by the Biden administration to do that, which is true, because that happened, we are going to send billions of dollars to the Saudi theocracy and then to the Iranians and then to Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and at the same time, we're going to embrace green energy, which means giving the government of  complete control over a power grid here in America. That's our plan. Are you confused by it? Don't be. It's a moral victory. Let us know when you get tired of winning.

614	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-we-have-right-know-this	2022-03-09 23:13:00	Tucker Carlson: Someone needs to explain why there are dangerous biological weapons in Ukraine | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to claims that the U.S. is funding biological programs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you had told us just four days ago that the Biden administration was funding secret bio labs in Ukraine of all places, we would not have believed you. Yeah, I don't think we're going to put that on TV. No thanks. 

Then, if you told us that not only did the administration fund these secret bio labs in Ukraine, but that they then failed to secure the deadly contents of those labs before the Russian invasion—an invasion they knew was coming, an invasion they helped encourage—if you had told us that four days ago, we would have dismissed you as a nut. It was just too preposterous. We will not want anything to do with a story like that. There was no way it could be true. It was too far out. In any case, we already knew for a fact that that story was false. How do we know that? Because we read USA Today, America's newspaper.  

Within hours of the , USA Today published a rebuttal to all those crazies who were yammering on about secret Ukrainian bio labs. Here was the headline: ""Fact check: False claim of US biolabs in Ukraine tied to Russian disinformation campaign.""  

So, if you look carefully at the story—and we did because we were interested—you notice that this fact check was sourced to Ukrainian government unnamed officials and then  officials. These were not exactly objective sources on this subject, but still the story seemed definitive. It was totally emphatic. ""Russia has teamed up with China to further amplify the false claim of U.S. labs in Ukraine."" 

OK. USA Today says it's Russian disinformation. Maybe it is. On to the next story, but the fact checks didn't stop. That was weird. We kept seeing the same check again and again. It was almost like despite endless official clarification, some people refused to believe the Biden administration. They preferred Russian propaganda instead and we assume they must be QAnon members. We assume that because Foreign Policy Magazine told us that. According to Foreign Policy, QAnon, whatever that is, was frantically disseminating ""false claims of U.S. bio warfare labs in Ukraine."" 

Those labs obviously didn't exist. It was all just another lie from the Russians who lie for a living. Then the European Union... weighed in, throwing its credibility behind the same claim. These are conspiracy theories, the EU told us, they're lies spread by Putin. An EU spokesmen then reminded us that, ""the credibility of information provided by the Kremlin is in general, very doubtful and low."" That was good to know.  

""Russian disinformation has a track record of promoting manipulative narratives about biological weapons and alleged secret labs."" 

Yeah. We're not going to do a segment about secret labs in Ukraine. Last thing we want to do on this show is traffic in Russian disinformation spread by QAnon, so we took a pass on that story. And that's where things stood until yesterday when we happened to tune in to a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 

Toria Nuland was testifying so we were interested. Nuland was one of the people who brought us the Iraq War, never apologized for that and kept getting promoted because that's how DC works. Toria Nuland is now Joe Biden's Under Secretary of State in charge of Ukraine and she knows a lot about Ukraine.  

In 2014, Toria Nuland engineered a coup in Ukraine in the name of democracy, of course. So, she is a highly informed source about Ukraine. So, she was having this colloquy with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during her testimony, and at one point, Rubio took a tack that we were not expecting at all. He asked Nuland if Ukraine had biological weapons.  

We never imagined Ukraine would have biological weapons. Why would Ukraine have bioweapons? So, it seemed like a pretty strange question, but it wasn't half as shocking as the answer he got. Here's what Toria Nuland said.  

Does Ukraine have biological weapons? Ugh, Ukraine has biological research facilities. What? You mean secret bio labs like the secret bio labs that Ukraine definitely doesn't have? Ukraine has those? Yes, it does. And not only does Ukraine have secret bio labs, Toria Nuland said, whatever they're doing in those labs is so dangerous and so scary that she is, ""quite concerned"" that the so-called research material inside those bio labs might fall into the hands of Russian forces. 

Try not to use profanity on the air to describe our reaction. Our jaws dropped, let's leave it there. Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Nuland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral to believe is, in fact, totally and completely true.  

Woah, you don't hear things like that every day in Washington. Talk about a showstopper and a dozen questions instantly jump to mind. What exactly are they doing in these secret Ukrainian bio labs? Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe. It's hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We're assuming these weren't pharmaceutical labs, probably not developing new Leukemia drugs. From your answer, Toria Nuland, we would assume because you all but said it, that there's a military application to this research, that they were working on bioweapons. Again, your answer suggests that.  

Why would we fund something like that in Ukraine, and why didn't you secure the contents of these bio labs before the Russians arrived as you knew they would? And then why did you go out of your way to lie to the American public about all of this? If the ""research materials"" in these labs were to escape somehow and you seem very concerned about that, what would be the effect on Ukraine and then on the rest of the world? How can we prepare for the consequences of that, this thing that you're worried about? Shouldn't we be preparing? Because as it turns out, we've just spent the last two years living with the pathogen that began in another foreign bio lab funded by the United States government secretly.  

So, this question is on our mind. It seems fair. Now that's some of what we would have asked if we were U.S. Senators, which were not. Yes, there's a time limit. Time limit be damned because this is kind of important, but Rubio did not ask those questions. Instead, he changed the subject and told us once again that  is bad. 

OK, just get a pen. It's a classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they are planning to do themselves. That's what Toria Nuland said. We almost laughed out loud. So, what you're saying, Toria Nuland, if, for example, you were funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but wanted to hide that fact from the people who are paying for it, in whose name you were doing it, then you might lie about it by claiming the Russians were lying about it. In other words, you might mount a disinformation campaign by claiming the other guy was mounting a disinformation campaign. Is that what you're saying, Toria Nuland? It's pretty funny.  

What's not funny is that this is all entirely real. We invited Marco Rubio on the show tonight to tell us what he knows about these bio labs. He declined to come. That invitation remains open. In the meantime, let's review what little we do know about this. We're going to start with a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday. Now, we would never do this. We never played anything like this on the show before because of course, we're Americans and when we want to know what's going on we ask our own officials, the people we elect and whose salaries we pay, because it's our country.  

We don't go to foreign sources because we trust our own sources first. But when it turns out the people who represent us and run our government are lying to us and never apologize for it and doing horrific things in our names, then you have to open your mind a little bit and at least assess what other people are saying. So, here was the Russian claim.  

OK. So, that apparently—we hadn't seen that until this afternoon we started poking around—that may have been the root of the conspiracy theories that the fact checks told us were Russian disinformation. Let's quote it: ""Military biological programs are under development in Ukraine, financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry."" That's the Russian claim.  

Separately, a  spokesman said the Ukrainians were working on deadly pathogens, including plague and anthrax. Is that true? Now, obviously, we would not take Russia's word for that ever, but we don't have to take Russia's word for that. The U.S. Defense Department has a website that contains this media clip about the opening of a biological research facility in Ukraine in 2010.  

""U.S. Senator Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists. The level-3 bio-safety lab will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q Fever, as well as other dangerous pathogens."" 

Oh, OK. Then the National Pulse dug up 2011 report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences that also explained that the Odessa based laboratory ""is responsible for the identification of especially dangerous biological pathogens."" So, what we're doing—this is not the first time you've heard this story—we are funding the creation of deadly pathogens so we can study them and prevent people from getting infected with them. Maybe? There are lots of examples of this. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has a handy web page explaining that American and Ukrainian scientists have worked on a whole bunch of different experiments like this.  

Some of the projects include work on African swine fever virus, hemorrhagic fever virus, and various respiratory viruses. The interesting thing, the telling thing, is that the U.S. Embassy's website also contains links to fact sheets about America's support for biological research in Ukraine, but all those links are now dead. That's weird. It's our government. We pay for it. Again, they're there in our name, in the name of American citizens, but we can no longer read their web page. How does that work, exactly? They have no right to lie to us.  

The web page is archived, thankfully, and the fact sheets show Defense Department funding to laboratories in Ukraine. So that looks like proof. It's not Russian disinformation. It's totally real. Sorry USA Today, America's newspaper, it's real. You can look it up on the internet if you want. In the face of that evidence, the Pentagon is still lying about and in fact, they're repeating the same unbelievably stupid and now thoroughly discredited lies the fact checkers have told for weeks now. Here's the spokesman for the , John Kirby, today.  

If I were you, I wouldn't devote a drop of ink to it. First of all, you didn't get to make that decision, Mr. Bureaucrat. We have a free press in this country. You don't get to decide, but you'll notice at the end of that, Kirby refuses to answer the question. Has there been any relationship between the U.S. Pentagon and a bioweapons facility in Ukraine and if so, what is that relationship? That's Russian disinformation! What's the answer? We're not developing WMD in Ukraine right now! OK, got it, but why are we funding this and what exactly are we funding?  

We reached out to the State Department separately and they provided us with this very carefully worded statement: ""The U.S. Department of Defense does not own or operate biological laboratories in Ukraine."" Not that anyone said they did. Continuing the quote, ""Undersecretary Nuland was referring to Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories during her testimony, which are not biological weapons facilities."" What's the difference exactly? Continuing the quote, ""These institutions counter biological threats throughout the country."" 

So that means nothing. You could describe our nuclear stockpile correctly as defensive. Our nuclear weapons are not designed to preemptively kill anybody. They're designed to prevent other people from killing us, but they're still nuclear weapons. So, when you stop lying and telling us what's going on here and why don't you more specifically tell us why you didn't secure these materials? So, yes, we're funding secret bio labs in Ukraine, but they are diagnostic and biodefense laboratories that counter biological threats.  

OK, if these are purely defensive labs, why was Toria Nuland so concerned that Russians would get ahold of the materials from these facilities? Other world powers have come to the obvious conclusion. Again, we hate to do this, but under these circumstances, we asked our own spokespeople, they lied. We're going to the , a country we despise. Here's what they said today. They're calling on weapons inspectors to take a look at these facilities in Ukraine right away.  

Oh, they're putting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the screen! Yeah, we did. We also put U.S. government propaganda on the screen and the difference is we expect to be lied to by foreign governments. We're not globalists. We believe in one country. It's this country, the United States. We do not expect to be lied to by our government and we won't accept it. But let's get to the substance of what the Chinese government just said. We never agree with the Chinese government on anything, but in this case, they make a fair point. We now know that dangerous biological agents, whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant because they can be used as weapons. Is a gun a weapon? Not when you're quail hunting. When you're in a gunfight, it is. It's a ridiculous semantic debate.  

Dangerous biological agents remain, thanks to the Biden administration, unsecured in a chaotic war zone. At some point we need to know how that happened, who made those decisions. We have a right to know and let's hope someone in Congress, probably not Marco Rubio, but someone else, will get to the bottom of it, but in the meantime, we pray that somewhere, in the United States government, there as an adult who cares enough to get this situation under control immediately.

615	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-questions-biolabs-ukraine-everyone-asking	2022-03-10 23:37:00	Tucker Carlson: The questions about the biolabs in Ukraine that everyone should be asking | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to claims the U.S. has been funding biolabs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Wednesday, we told you that the Biden administration is funding a number of secretive biolabs in Ukraine, labs that are conducting experiments on highly dangerous pathogens. Now, that's not a story as we told you, that we wanted to do. In fact, we didn't think it could be true. It's so over-the-top and bizarre and in any case, the administration had repeatedly and very aggressively denied that they were doing anything like this and then they attacked anyone who has questions about it as a tool of Russia. 

We foolishly assumed that in this one instance, they might be telling the truth and then out of nowhere, the Biden official in charge of  confirmed the story. Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State, casually mentioned in a Senate hearing on Tuesday that actually, yes, the Biden administration does fund a series of biolabs in Ukraine and whatever is in these labs is so dangerous that she is deeply concerned these materials will fall into the hands of the Russian military.  

Now, that struck us as a shocking development. Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true. Toria Nuland's testimony raised at least two immediate questions. What exactly are these labs doing with our money and in our name? And why didn't the Biden administration secure the contents of these labs before the Russians invaded?  

So far, we haven't received any answer at all to the second question. We think we're the only ones who have even asked it. Whoever decided to leave deadly biological materials sitting in Ukraine as Russian troops massed on the border has not yet been identified. We hope that person will be identified. We'll keep asking. 

As for the first question, what exactly is going on in these labs? We've gotten several answers, all of them insulting. Initially, the administration claimed the labs were designed to help the Ukrainians fight tuberculosis, as well as various livestock diseases. That's what officials told members of Congress. It didn't seem plausible and, in fact, it's not plausible. And then after our show last night, the  released what it non-ironically called a fact sheet designed to make the biolab story seem small and ridiculous. Virtually every news organization in America, with almost no exceptions, repeated the administration's claim verbatim with no verification of any kind.  

Foreign Policy Magazine ran this version of it, which was identical to many other versions you saw if you follow the news today. ""FACT CHECK: DoD has worked with Ukraine to ELIMATE (in all caps) bioweapons left behind by the Soviet Union since 2005,"" said a senior U.S. defense intelligence official, ""but these are NOT (again, in all caps) weapons labs as Russians falsely claim,"" the official said.  

The Washington Post assured us of the same thing, so did countless other so-called news organizations. OK, so no big deal. This is not actually a story. The Pentagon's been doing it since 2005, working with Ukrainians to ""eliminate biological weapons left behind by the Soviets."" That makes sense, but wait. 2005 was 17 years ago. How long does it take to eliminate Soviet bioweapons? Seventeen years seems like a long time. If you had 17 years and ample funding from Congress, you could probably remove and catalog every grain of sand on Waikiki Beach and yet somehow, over that same period 17 years, the Pentagon has not finished removing test tubes from Soviet-era freezers.  

How does that work exactly? How heavy are these bioweapons? Do we lack the  capacity to get them out of Ukraine and bury them in the desert in Nevada? When was the Pentagon planning to finish this important job? In 20 years? In 50 years? Those all seem like very obvious questions, but not a single reporter asked any of those questions.  

Meanwhile, over at CNN, perhaps where the first explanation didn't make sense once you thought about it, offered a new alibi. According to CNN's site, the labs in Ukraine exist to ""secure old Soviet weapons."" Ok, secure, not eliminate, which raises the question: what does it mean to secure a bioweapon? And again, why has it taken 17 years to do it? And by the way, if these are really just old Soviet weapons, why is Toria Nuland so worried they will wind up in the hands of old Soviets who presumably already have these very same weapons—probably don't need more. It's absurd when you think about it. So, don't think about it and that was the point of today's coverage of the Biden administration's secret Ukrainian biolabs. Stop thinking about it. Start accepting what they tell you at face value. Otherwise, you are an agent of Russia. Here's CNN:

""These claims were debunked several years ago."" These facilities work on vaccines and reporting outbreak, and then they play Russian propaganda. The point is anyone who asks questions about this is repeating Russian propaganda. Got it? And the truth is, we're not interested in what Russian propagandists say about these Ukrainian biolabs. We're not interested in what the propagandists at CNN say about these biolabs. We're Americans, so we would like, in fact, we think we have a right to demand the Biden administration to answer simple questions, straightforward questions. These are obviously questions important enough to make Toria Nuland very nervous. But why? We don't know. They won't answer.  

So, instead, we did some digging of ourselves to see what we could find and here's we came up with. The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Robert Pope, the man who heads the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DOD, sat for an interview with the website Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Pope was the man in charge of securing or eliminating Soviet-era bioweapons, so he knows a lot about the subject, maybe more than anyone else, but it turns out that not all of these Soviet weapons are being destroyed or even secured, and Pope acknowledged that in the interview, which apparently CNN didn't see.  

According to his interview, Pope said the labs ""may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bioweapons program preserved in freezers for research purposes."" Pope said that ""scientists, being scientists, it wouldn't surprise me if some of these strange collections and some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that go all the way back to the origins of that program."" 

In other words, because as Pope put it, ""scientists are scientists,"" they don't want to destroy all the bioweapons. Instead, they're using them to conduct new bioweapons research. That's what he said and not just on strains left over from the Soviet Union. The second lie. In fact, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has acknowledged joint American and Ukrainian research on other pathogens such as hemorrhagic fever virus. Apparently, there's a lot of this going on in Ukraine funded by the United States. Did you know that? Why Ukraine? We don't know. We can only guess. 

We do know that in 2010, the U.S. government helped fund construction of a brand-new level-3 biolab in Odessa, Ukraine. The purpose of that lab was not to eliminate or secure aging Soviet weapons. No. That lab was designed for research a new and ""especially dangerous pathogens"" in Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe. Again, not a hotbed of biomedical research. Why Ukraine? We don't know. Someone should find out.  

We do know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact on television today and last night were an utter lie. Did the reporters, who repeated those talking points verbatim, know they were a lie? Maybe they did. On the other hand, how would they know? They didn't bother to do any reporting whatsoever. They got a text from some Biden administration flack and they just read it on the air like it was true. You shouldn't be surprised because that's what they do and it's possible they're afraid not to do that. They know if they stray from the script the White House has written for them, they'll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin. Here's Biden's publicist doing the very same thing today:  

Yeah, but no one denies that. That's the thing. No one denies that Russia has a chem bio program. That's bad. No one denies that Russia lies, of course, and has for a long time, that Russian propaganda is absolutely real, of course. That's not for debate. That's all true.  

The question is: Why is the United States funding these biolabs that are not doing anything close to what the Pentagon claims they are doing? Why is the White House press secretary from the podium contradicting what the director of the Pentagon's bioweapons control program has already admitted is true? Why is she doing that and how should we feel about all of this? Insulted, but also very concerned. There is absolutely a story here, a story that matters, clearly. That's why they're lying about it.

616	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-damage-president-biden-russia-ukraine-putin	2022-03-11 22:56:00	Tucker: This is the single-most damaging thing any American president has ever done | Fox News	" Fox News host slams Biden over inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You wonder if looking backward many years from right now, historians will notice the remarkable coincidence in timing. Have you noticed? Here it is. At exactly the moment when the emergency powers they awarded to themselves to fight COVID started to wane, our leaders began pushing for conflict with Russia, and then, on the basis of that conflict, they assumed historic war powers. 

Without even pausing, the Biden administration declared total economic war on a sovereign country. No American had been killed. The United States had not been invaded or attacked and yet, with no meaningful public debate or congressional authorization, the Biden administration destroyed that country's currency, then removed it from the international banking system that impoverished its population.  

Then the administration began seizing the property of people affiliated with that country without a trial or due process of any kind, without even bothering to explain exactly what crime they had committed. No American government had ever done anything like that before. If there was one thing the U.S. government long stood for, it was the rule of law. The integrity of the system was always the most important thing, but not anymore.  

That turned out to be an era, and that era is gone. Because the target is Russia, very few Americans have noticed any of this. They support it. Virtually no one has paused to ask him or herself where this might be going. How long until our leaders do something similar to their domestic enemies here in the United States? How long before they accuse you of collusion or disloyalty or some other hard-to-define crime, declare you an enemy of the state and then confiscate your bank account?  

Something very much like that just happened in . We don't imagine it could happen here. Mostly, we just don't think about it. What we think about is Ukraine and that's the other thing that's changed. The tech monopolies now exert a level of control over American public opinion that has no precedent in all of history, eliminating Section 230 or whatever piddling reform Congress is talking about at the moment. It all seems like a joke at this point. It's too late. The medieval church had less command over society's emotions than Facebook and Google and Twitter now do.  

For the past two years, you have watched these companies, above all, define who you, as an American, must hate. Depending upon their directive of the day, our citizens dutifully change their social media avatars from BLM signs, to mask-up slogans, to now Ukrainian flags. Each is a crisis and each new crisis is carefully stage-managed from Silicon Valley at the direction of the White House. How does the human brain compete with this? How does it understand it? Well, it doesn't. Clarity and perspective become impossible. In the hysteria, even the recent past just evaporates.  

The morning that Russia invaded Ukraine, you may have been talking about a lot of different things — COVID, or crime, or the southern border. Not anymore. Much to relief for the White House, all of those topics have been forgotten, maybe forever. No population has ever been more skillfully manipulated than our population is being manipulated right now, but even with the tech monopolies on the case full-time, there are limits, some topics cannot be hidden, and inflation is one of them.  

Google can delete all the search results it wants, but you still know what hamburgers and gasoline cost because you go to the store. You know exactly how bad inflation is, and it's bad. In fact, inflation is so high right now that even affluent people are worried about it, and not worried in some abstract sense, like about the long-term health of the country. Though, that too. People who make 250 grand a year are worried they will not be able to continue living as they do now. You may or may not feel sorry for them, but let's put it in perspective. Imagine if you made 50 grand a year or 30 grand a year, as many Americans do, you would be terrified in the face of this , and maybe you are.  

So, what's causing it? What is the root of the inflation? If you want to know the answer to that question, the fastest way to get it is to check to see what politicians are denying. Whatever they claim is not the cause of inflation almost certainly is the cause of inflation, and with that in mind, here's Joe Biden telling you that government spending has nothing to do with it.  

Now you can say, ""Well, that's just Joe Biden.  has never had a real job, even before he became senile, he was reputed to be a dim-bulb and he was."" Don't kid yourself. In the clip you just saw, Joe Biden knows perfectly well he's lying. ""It's simply not true,"" he squeaks. Really, Joe Biden? How is it simply not true?  

Notice he doesn't tell you how it's simply not true because, in fact, it is emphatically, unequivocally true. Inflation is a function of money supply. The more money you have in circulation, the less that money is worth. Even Joe Biden understands that. The month after Biden became president, the supply of U.S. dollars in circulation increased more than it ever had before in a single month, and then it kept going higher month, after month, after month as the administration and the Congress kept the money taps open, and that's why we have historic inflation now, because they printed too much money. It's not complicated, but it's not the whole story. It did not start with Joe Biden, to be fair.  

In the months after the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve assumed emergency powers to respond to the financial collapse. Now, if you're noticing a theme here, the people in charge giving themselves emergency powers in the face of a crisis they created, you may be on to something. But in any case, after 2008, the Fed dropped interest rates to near-zero and then began printing money. This was supposed to save our economy, and maybe it would have saved the economy if it had ended at some point, but it did not end. It went on to the present day. That's nearly 14 years and in the process, what was designed to save our economy destroyed our economy. 

Several times over the years, wiser heads at the Fed talked about dropping the emergency measures and reintroducing reality into the American economy, reintroducing market forces. Remember those? But each time they contemplated this, Wall Street revolted in very public ways. Wage growth and the productive economy had stalled, but the market for private jets was booming. So, asset inflation became the basis of wealth for many people at the top end. Buy things, then sell them for more. Make nothing.  

Now, no society can continue like that for very long because it's not inherently productive. It's a shell game, but ours did for more than 14 years, and in the process, this country became more lopsided economically than it's ever been. Fewer people owning more of everything. The Fed was fully aware of this. They're not stupid. They knew they were causing these trends and that most of these trends were dangerous and bad for America, but the truth is, nobody could stop it.  

Fed governors understood that markets would tank if they tried to pull back. So, it was really a classic Ponzi. It was criminal mismanagement of our economy, but nobody could stop doing it for fear the whole thing would collapse, and now we're at the end stage. The Fed is out of tricks. The problem with inflation — and some economists want limited inflation at certain periods, some people in Davos have been calling for it for years — but the problem with inflation levels like this is there is no simple way to pull them back.  

The Fed can not painlessly massage its way out of $7-a-gallon gas prices. So, when you reach a state as we are now, you really have only two options. You can pretend it's not happening, or you can blame someone else for it, and the White House is trying both. Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen trying the first.  

Now, you wonder as you stare into the camera and say something like that, if you imagine, if you can convince yourself there's a single human being who believes you. Things are great. You should be grateful for our wise stewardship of your economy. Keep in mind, the woman you just heard, Janet Yellen, was the chair of the Federal Reserve for four years, so not to be technical about it, but if anyone is culpable for the disaster we're living through now, it would be .

So, she knows she's lying, and she's not even lying very effectively, because once again, Americans understand the state of the economy because they live within it. They pay for things. So, if you're going to lie about its cause, you're going to have to do better than just pretending it's not going on. You're going to have to blame somebody else, and so the White House enlisted Joe Biden's publicist to make a video about Vladimir Putin. Watch this.  

I want to talk to you a little bit about why that's happening. What, do you work at NPR now? You don't know anything. You are a publicist. Please, stay in your lane. But she's telling us that actually oil companies, which we assume were very greedy and that was the problem with them, in fact, don't want to make money. That's their real secret, and that's why they're not drilling for oil anymore, because they just don't want the oil, because they're oil companies and their altruistic or something.  

She must have learned that in gender studies class at Oberlin. Now she's telling the rest of us. But really, Jen Psaki said, it's about Vladimir Putin. It's Vladimir Putin's fault that you're paying more for gas. Now, the truth is, Vladimir Putin did invade Ukraine. That's true. That's bad, but that's not why you can't afford to fill your tank.  

It was the White House, and we should say the Congress' reaction to the invasion, that is roiling our economy. That's true. So among many other things, the White House just banned Russian oil imports, for example. Oil prices immediately rose. That's what happens when you shake up a market like that. Americans immediately suffered. We were told, many people told us, it's worth it because this is a moral victory against Putin, and some people took solace in this, but you have to wonder, how exactly is this a moral victory against Putin? Think about it for a minute.  

Russia is a major oil producer. Jen Psaki said that in her interminable video a moment ago. That would mean that higher oil prices help Putin. They make Putin, and the Saudis, and the Venezuelans, and Iran much, much richer. Why? Because Russia can still sell its oil in global markets because the world has not joined our boycott. What does this tell you? It tells you that the loser in this policy is not Vladimir Putin. He's the winner. It's the United States, and it's not just oil.  

Thanks to the Biden administration's mismanagement, commodities across the board are up dramatically — potash, fertilizers, wheat — huge. Nickel went up 250 percent in two days. Who's going to pay for all this? You are. This is the biggest tax increase of your life, and, by the way, it could very easily get worse. Why? Because oil is traded in U.S. dollars. Ever hear the term petrodollars?  

Why would the rest of the world continue to trade oil in U.S. dollars, a fact that greatly benefits us, when there's uncertainty imposed by political forces on oil markets? There would be a huge incentive to trade oil in another currency. Maybe the Chinese currency? Maybe the euro? Maybe crypto? Who knows? But there will be new and competing markets in which oil is traded in something other than U.S. dollars, and that's a massive loss for us.  

Here's the bigger truth: Our global financial systems benefit us. That may not be fair, but it's true, and they're the basis of our wealth. So, if you destroy them in an effort to get Putin, who are you really destroying? You're destroying the United States, and that's exactly what they've done. When you attack and destabilize the global financial systems, to restate, you are attacking and destabilizing the United States, not Putin.  

You can't see this right now, because there's so much hysteria being ginned up by the media, particularly on social media, but when that hysteria lifts, when the cloud finally evaporates, it will be obvious that the Biden administration's response to the invasion of Ukraine is the single-most damaging thing any American president has ever done to this country and to the world — not to Putin — to us and to a lot of small countries that didn't deserve it.  

It's hard to see that now. All you're seeing are Ukrainian flag emojis on Twitter, but someday we will assess this moment with clear heads, and when we do, we will be horrified.

617	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-everything-tulsi-gabbard-said-true	2022-03-14 23:53:00	Tucker Carlson: Everything that Tulsi Gabbard said about biolabs in Ukraine is true | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take Zelenskyy's latest idea and provides insight on the biolabs in Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here's something we just saw. (We) wish we brought it to you earlier. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of , of course, gave an interview recently that didn't get enough attention in this country. Zelenskyy, needless to say, is currently engaged in a desperate fight for his country, his government, his life, and he has been since the Russian military invaded Ukraine nearly three weeks ago.  

So, you can assume there's not a lot Zelenskyy thinks about at this point, apart from getting the Russians off of Ukrainian soil. So last week, Zelenskyy floated the idea of accepting so-called Ukrainian neutrality, agreeing not to join NATO. In exchange for that, he will get a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.  

Now, there's nothing inherently controversial about Zelenskyy's idea. Ukraine was not on the cusp of joining NATO anyway. NATO officials have long said they don't want Ukraine to join. It's not clear whose interest would be served by Ukraine joining NATO. So, if accepting the status quo—going with the way things already were, and we're always going to be, if doing that convinces Putin to stop killing Ukrainians and spares Ukraine from total and complete destruction, maybe it's not a crazy idea. Maybe Zelenskyy is on to something. He certainly thought about it a lot.  

Maybe we ought to congratulate Zelenskyy for acting wisely on behalf of the country he leads. This could be a win for him and for the entire world. Probably not a lot of American media outlets will describe it that way, however. Indeed, by mentioning NATO, a topic that is completely off limits in American media, Zelenskyy may have gone too far. Daily, in every possible venue, we are told that NATO is paradoxically both of central importance to the United States and at the same time, irrelevant to what happens in Eastern Europe. 

So, years of talk about expanding NATO into Ukraine—we've watched those happen in public—that had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia invading Ukraine. Nothing at all. That's what they tell us. Putin invaded Ukraine because he's bad, end of conversation. And anyone who says otherwise, anyone who suggests there might be a way out of this disaster, short of total war, anyone who says that is immediately denounced as a tool of Russian propaganda. So, what does that mean?  

It means that by acknowledging that NATO expansion is what Putin seems to care about most, Zelenskyy is, by definition, at least in this country, repeating Russian talking points. That would make the president of Ukraine a Putin collaborator. Sound insane? Well, then you can still think clearly, but that's the state of play. How do we know this? Let's just say we've lived it.  

We've made the point repeatedly that forcing Ukraine into NATO will in no way serve the interests of the United States, and in fact could hurt us here in ways from which we will never recover. And, by the way, talking about it doesn't seem to have helped Ukraine either. For saying that, and that's all we've said, here's the reaction we've received, and this is just a small selection. We could go on about it, but here it is:

Oh, almost treasonous. Siding with Putin? Who is siding with ? I haven't seen anybody do that. I've seen a few people try to side with the United States and that, says Mitt Romney, a man who got four deferments to keep himself out of the Vietnam War, that is almost treasonous.  

What's so interesting—and we don't want to pick on Mitt Romney here, it's too easy—but it does seem like if you take a step back, the very same people who spent the last say two years telling us that this country, our country, is inherently sinful, and racist, and disgusting, and born in iniquity, those same people, the ones who lecture you about how there's something inherently wrong with you, if you live here, we're born here, those same people have been the very quickest, the very first to whip around and accuse anyone who wants to save the United States from yet another pointless war, a war that they would never fight in and nor would their children, accuse those people of being unpatriotic.  

Well, you don't love America enough, says the man who thinks America is racist. How does that work exactly? We're not sure, but in case you've forgotten, here's the very same Mitt Romney marching with the very same people who told us that this is a White supremacist hellhole and, by the way, we've got to do away with the nuclear family. That's never done anybody any good. Here he is:  

So, OK, it's just Mitt Romney, never a genius, obviously deep in the grip of some late life crisis, licking his wounds from being beaten by Obama in 2012. OK, but it's not just Mitt Romney. Imagine how you would feel if you were a business owner in Kenosha or Minneapolis or Atlanta or Louisville, if you were someone who, I don't know, used to go to St. John's Church in Washington, D.C., or someone who works in the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, before BLM torched all of it. You're long accustomed to knowing that your leaders don't really care about you, but when they reveal that they actively hate you, that's hard to take.  

So, of course, Mitt Romney is debasing himself, degrading himself, in order to be liked in Washington. Yeah, we've seen that, of course, but it's deeper than that. Needless to say, the people Mitt Romney wants to like him, his new masters, were not satisfied with him marching with BLM or denouncing his critics as almost treasonous. They want more.  

They won't be satisfied until every Republican in the U.S. Senate is wholly indistinguishable from Chris Hayes, and they're getting pretty close. On Sunday, yesterday, Mitt Romney edged a little closer. Here's what he wrote to Tulsi Gabbard. Now, Tulsi Gabbard is a former member of Congress who currently serves as lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve and, unlike Mitt Romney, has been deployed.  

""Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives."" Treasonous lies have cost lives, potentially. So, you're betraying your country and committing murder. So, what exactly did Tulsi Gabbard do? Did she call for a violent overthrow of the United States government? Does she come out and pledge allegiance to Putin? Did she get a Cyrillic tattoo on her neck? No, she didn't.  

What she said is, we have a problem, here's how we know. She cited publicly available information and said we should probably deal with that problem. But, in any case, here you have Mitt Romney, who was a consultant, for God's sakes, accusing someone who's been in the Army for nearly two decades of treason. People didn't used to talk that way. Treason is a death penalty offense. It's absurd on its face, but if you watch the video that got Mitt Romney to call a fellow American treasonous and suggest she was committing murder, it really makes your head spin. Here's what Tulsi Gabbard actually said that made Mitt Romney accuse her of betraying her own country:

  

Yeah, she hates our country because she's worried that a pathogen might escape from a biolab and hurt people. There's no recent precedent for that, so she's clearly listening to Alex Jones too much, and she's treasonous. Actually, everything that Tulsi Gabbard said, as you know, is true. It's not a Republican issue. It's not a Democrat issue. It's a factual issue and even in war, truth is a defense. In fact, it's the only defense. Is it true? And in a free country, you can speak the truth. That right can never be taken away or else it's not a free country.  

By the way, since we're speaking of facts, the director of the U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, a man who would know a man called Robert Pope, has confirmed that scientists are keeping Soviet-era pathogens for research purposes in Ukraine. They told us they were destroying them. They should have destroyed them, but they haven't. What could go wrong in an active war zone? And they knew that those pathogens existed and were being experimented upon, researched. And they didn't secure them before the Russians invaded, though they knew the Russian invasion was coming because they told us. And then, Toria Nuland, the Under Secretary of State who oversees this disaster, testified under oath that, yes, Russian forces might seize those biolabs in Ukraine, and we should all be very worried about that possibility.  

Over the weekend, CBS News reported that Pentagon officials have confirmed that these biolabs in Ukraine are, in fact, conducting research on anthrax and other ""deadly pathogens.""  

OK, so we're a little confused about what all the hyperventilating is about, and you just heard CBS say, you've heard many say that Russia may seize these biological agents in Ukraine and use them against the Ukrainians and who knows who else. You would pause and think, ""Well, wait a second. If these are Soviet era weapons, then presumably the Soviets—now called the Russian government—probably have their own. So why would they want to seize stuff they already have? It doesn't actually make a lot of sense, but whatever."" 

You'll notice that the reporter admits that these pathogens are in Ukraine. They're doing research on botulism and anthrax. So, any reasonable person would be concerned by that because there's a war going on and, by the way, why were they funding this in Ukraine in the first place? But that's really a secondary question. Maybe we can get to the bottom of that when the war's over, but Tulsi Gabbard addressed and only addressed the danger that innocent people could die because these weapons, apparently these pathogens, these agents, exist in Ukraine.  

She didn't blame it on Russia. She didn't blame anybody. She just said this is a thing. Unsecured bioweapons in a war zone are a bad idea. That's not reasonable now? That's treason? Reason isn't part of the way people are thinking now. Everybody in leadership has completely lost the ability to think beyond the next tweet. Who is thinking about tomorrow or next month or 20 years from now? Not one person and anyone who tries is an agent of Putin.  

""These supposed biolabs."" Well, the U.S. government says they have biolabs and told us under oath that they're worried that the contents of these biolabs, which they failed to secure, might get into the wrong hands, but it's right-wing Putin night propaganda.  

We're taking Nuland's remarks out of context. OK, what's the right context? We asked. No one told us. Robert Pope's remarks—were they taken out of context to? This is insane. There's a problem. Before we even assign blame to the problem, it might be worth thinking through how to fix the problem, but no. Anyone who mentions it should shut up and not just shut up, be shut up by force if necessary, with jail time. Now, we're going to do something we almost never do. We're going to play you a clip from ""The View,"" which is now calling for a Department of Justice investigation into this show and Tulsi Gabbard.  

Really? They used to arrest people for saying stuff like this. Hmm. When did they arrest people for saying stuff like this? And who was they, exactly? Well, the former Caryn Elaine Johnson didn't tell us. She kept it vague because that way it's a lot more threatening and maybe you will shut up. And again, we hesitate to highlight that show. It's an IQ killer, but we're making an exception tonight because The View is not alone. A lot of people sound like this and it's one of these processes where it sounds insane, I mean, for sure I can't believe they said that and then over time, what sounded crazy the first time you heard it sounds a little more normal and then three weeks into the war, it sounds like probably pretty necessary.  

Keith Olbermann is always at the cutting edge of things like this. He was watching The View today. He doesn't have a lot else to do and he responded to that segment by writing this on Twitter. ""They (us) are Russian assets and there is a war. There's a case for detaining them militarily. Trials are a sign of good faith and patience on the part of democracy."" 

So, we're at war with Russia. We must send you to the gulag because freedom. Because a democracy, the one thing democracies have patience for is dissenting views from its own citizens, particularly citizens who sincerely hope and pray for the best for their own country. Those people must be imprisoned militarily. That's what he's saying. And no one's disagreeing. All of permanent Washington, every orifice of the national media, all fully aligned to push a single message. When was the last time that happened? Ought to make you nervous.  

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who's leaving thankfully, said the other at the current moment is the most united this country has been since 9/11. Well, he's right in one way. It's certainly united the United States Congress. As of this afternoon, nine out of the last 10 tweets that Rob Portman sent have been about Ukraine. Oh, not a single tweet about the fact you're getting poorer by the day. Try to fill up your car. On Amazon, last night, a single jar of organic peanut butter cost $15. That's just one product. A retailer renowned for offering the cheapest possible, $15 for a peanut butter. Spread that across the entire grocery store and that's what you're looking at. 

Is that going to help with the fentanyl killings that are going on right now? 100,000 people died last year. No, Rob Portman doesn't care. What he cares about is Ukraine and he shares that concern with Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and of course, Liz Cheney. So, they are unified, but what's so interesting, if this is such a unifying moment, then why was their first instinct to denounce fellow Americans as traitors and call for them to be imprisoned? Really unifying?  

They don't care about Ukraine, a lot of these people, any more than they cared about George Floyd. They used tragedy, George Floyd's death, the tragic invasion of Ukraine, for domestic political purposes. This has unleashed something really dark in the United States. In order to make wise decisions, you have to be rational, thoughtful, forward-thinking and calm and they're the opposite of all of those things.

618	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-propaganda-real-crises	2022-03-16 00:01:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden's propaganda is meant to distract you from the real crises | Fox News	"Fox News host reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic two years later, China's new lockdowns and a cartel firefight on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We keep a detailed daily calendar. We checked this morning and believe it or not, this week is the two-year anniversary of the coronavirus lockdowns. Those are the first mass quarantines in American history and if you look back, you'll be struck by how much has changed since those lockdowns began. Think back to the America you grew up in. There were three things you knew about that country: It was a free country. It was a middle-class country. It was defined by small business and it was a constitutional country. Our politicians were limited by the guardrails in our founding documents. They couldn't go past that. So, it was a happy place.  

Unfortunately, none of those three things are still true about the United States and lockdowns are not entirely to blame for that. No single cause ever is, but there's no question that the coronavirus lockdowns accelerated the transformation of the United States. Just think of masks. So, we knew early on that paper masks were not going to stop the spread of COVID.  

A couple of studies, including a big study from Vietnam, showed pretty clearly that they were not effective and then we watched the behavior of our public officials. It turns out they didn't like masks any more than anyone else liked masks, despite the fact they had ordered you to wear masks. When they thought no one was watching, they often went bare faced. So, you saw that, and you had to wonder: If masks are so darn effective and lifesaving, why aren't our leaders wearing them?  

We made that point. We made many points like it. We made them dozens of times on the show and, needless to say, it had no effect at all. The mask mandates stayed. In some places, they still remain. So, as this unfolded, we started to realize that masks, in fact a lot of this, was not really about  or public health. So, what was it about?  

Well, recently we learned the answer because we watched it. Masks were a training exercise. Mandatory masking was a shock collar designed to teach Americans unquestioning obedience and, of course, it worked because shock collars do work. In a single day last month we watched, for example, our entire professional class dutifully changed their Twitter avatars from mask up to the now mandatory Ukrainian flag.  

There was no debate about doing this, no reflection. There was not even a real conversation. They just did it. Millions of people simply assumed reflexively a partisan position in a highly complicated foreign crisis, the next crisis, and as they did it, they moved in perfect lockstep. They were guided by their masters of the social media companies who were themselves taking direction from the .  

The whole thing was like watching synchronized swimming in Pyongyang. It was an amazing performance. Most amazing of all was seeing Republican leaders join the herd after two years of COVID training, they couldn't help themselves. The result was the largest political flash mob in American history—Republicans, Democrats, business titans and the media all on one side.  

So, of course, dissent of any kind was banned instantly and if you persist in asking questions about all of this found themselves censored and those who persisted in asking questions because they were lucky enough to have a rare, protected platform, found themselves threatened with something worse—maybe indictment, maybe arrest. Here's former Senator Claire McCaskill of , threatening this show just last night. 

Oh, so defending our country from your recklessness and unwise decision-making is treason? Declare your loyalty to Ukraine or you've committed a crime, right? Claire McCaskill, whatever you think of her, was not talking like that two years ago. No one in public was talking that way two years ago, before COVID. In a free country, you're allowed to say what you think is true. You can defend your country if you want, even if politicians disagree with you. That was the whole point of living in the United States, but not anymore.  

Now, if enough powerful people, that would be former senators, New York Times columnists, retired Intel chiefs working as contributors to MSNBC, if enough of these people call for you to be indicted, you probably will be indicted. If not for the core crime, then for another crime. They'll find something. That's our justice system now works. Those are the rules. This is a big change over what we had before for about 250 years. 

So how do we get this new system? Simple, we eliminated the guardrails. We got rid of the principles that set limits to our leaders' power. Those principles, in short, were personal autonomy and the sanctity of the citizens' conscience. And we surrendered both of those during COVID. They no longer exist. We let them go. Once we allowed political leaders to force Americans to take drugs they didn't want, the old arrangement where the citizen had as much or more power as the leaders was over. Our politicians now have effectively limitless power, and they know that. They know it perfectly well. That's why they did it and if you doubt that they know it, watch the way they communicate with the American population.  

They're giving you propaganda. They always have. What's changed is that their propaganda is no longer sophisticated or persuasive because it doesn't have to be. Instead, their propaganda is blunt and vulgar. They summon TikTok performers to the White House so that some 18-year-old, who has never had a job, can tell you that inflation and historically high gas prices are actually  fault. They just did that, in fact. Here's the result.  

OK, so nothing against teenage energy expert in Lycra you just saw, but that is not the way you communicate with a population in a democracy. That's not the way you talk to free people. That is the way that you command your serfs. You assume that they're stupid and so you serve them up stupid propaganda. You patronize them like you're speaking to a housekeeper at a hotel in Cabo. ""We call this oil. It costs very much now. Vladimir Putin, very bad man."" That's what they're saying and they're saying it for a reason, because when you no longer respect your own citizens, you can't be bothered to speak in complex sentences.  

You have TikTok influencers deliver your lines. All around this, this is happening even on former news channels. This is exactly what they're doing. That's their power, but it's not their main power. Their main power, the one they deploy most often, is the power to change the subject, the power to force you to ignore what actually matters to you and your family and your country, and focus instead on what matters to them. They call it democracy. Congress, at the moment, for example, is totally absorbed in the question of how to arm . How many MiGs should be sending to Zelenskyy and how do we get them there? 

 Now, that's not an issue that directly or even indirectly is related to the many, many...growing number of pressing problems the United States is facing domestically, but even on its own terms, even you think that's the most important thing that we could be talking about, they're not really talking about it in any complete sense and if you doubt that, ask yourself how you would handle it.  

You're the Congress and you're moved by the suffering in Ukraine. Every American is. Americans are kind people. They want to help. Civilians in Ukraine are being crushed by Vladimir Putin. That's true. How can we help? Well, why don't we send more weapons to Ukraine in the middle of a war? It doesn't sound like a bad idea, but if you're going to make that decision, you'd probably feel some kind of moral obligation to consider the ramifications. Like, what effect will this actually have? Is it possible that doing this, as well-intentioned as it is, (and it is) is it possible doing this will be counterproductive? Will it hurt the people I'm hoping to help?  

Will it, for example, prolong the fighting in Ukraine at the expense of the vulnerable civilian population in Ukraine? If I do this, could I inadvertently be doing to Ukraine what the West inadvertently did to, let's say, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan? You wouldn't want that. You'd hate to do something like that again, because that would be cruel. So, you'd want to make sure you weren't doing that. But not a single person in Washington, at least in public, appears to be asking that question. No one's allowed to ask that question. What are you a Putin defender? And in fact, as well-meaning as most Americans are—most of our lawmakers are well-meaning—you get the sense that the core figures in our foreign policy establishment don't really care. And in fact, never have cared about the effects of their policy.  

We can give you a million examples. Here's one: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright way back in 1996, shrugged off the documented deaths of half a million Iraqi children. Not a small number, half a million, because imposing sanctions on Saddam Hussein was ""worth it."" 

So, keep in mind that debate, that conversation, was about sanctions, which were certainly going to hurt Saddam Hussein. They didn't. He ended up invading seven years later because sanctions didn't work. When have sanctions worked exactly to achieve their desired outcome? Let us know when you find out, but in the meantime, a half a million children died, but it was worth it. Because, because why?  

Well, in retrospect, sadly, and it burdens the conscience of every decent person, it's hard to see why it was worth it, but you should know that these are exactly the same people who are now giving you more lectures right now. In fact, at this very moment on every other channel on television, 24 hours a day, about how we have a moral obligation to wade blindly into a war in Eastern Europe against a country that has not attacked us and if we don't do that, you're a traitor.  

What's going on here? High levels of aggression, that's for sure, but deflection too. Our leaders are a master of deflection. They yell so you won't notice what else is happening. What else is happening? Well, it turns out one of the biggest stories of the decade dropped this morning, you may not even be aware of it, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is considering accepting Chinese currency rather than U.S. dollars for its oil sales to China now. Why is that a big deal? Seems like some little financial story. Well, because it would spell the end of the petrodollar. The petrodollar is one of the keys to the United States' wealth.  

Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in U.S. dollars for nearly half a century and that is one of the key reasons the United States has the highest living standard of any big country in the world, despite the fact that our manufacturing sector long ago collapsed. You may have wondered how that worked. Why are we still so rich? Well, this is how. Petrodollars allow our government, in short, to spend money that we don't have and that money pays for an awful lot of what we have—healthcare, retirements, the military. We could go on—everything, essentially. 

As economist Gal Luft put it in interview with The Wall Street Journal today, ""The oil market and by extension, the entire global commodities market, is the insurance policy of the status of the dollar is the reserve currency. If that block is taken out of the wall, the wall will begin to collapse."" 

What's the wall? Well, it's the U.S. economy. Not a small story, maybe even a bigger story than the invasion of Ukraine. Weird that we're not talking about it. Meanwhile, at the exact same moment that happened there's this: The Chinese government has decided to wound our already teetering economy once again by using the pretext of COVID. So, the Chinese have ordered lockdowns in factory towns, towns that make Toyotas, Volkswagen, circuit boards, air conditioning units, batteries, televisions and, yes, iPhones.  

Now why are they doing this? Well, you're supposed to believe it's all about the coronavirus, which has mysteriously resurged in China in the middle of a war in which China is siding with the country that we are against, Russia. Can that really be true? Hard to believe. Is it really just the virus that's causing this behavior? Yes, say the propagandists of The Washington Post, it definitely is. It's definitely not a trade war brought on by the Biden administration's incompetence in international affairs. We're not suffering for the fact they don't know what they're doing. No, it's just a virus.  

A pundit called Catherine Rampell, for example, told us with a straight face that, ""Daily COVID cases in China have reached numbers not publicly reported since 2020...Thanks partly to low vaccination rates for the elderly in China, plus the relative ineffectiveness of Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines, the Chinese government has responded to outbreaks with an iron fist."" 

They should have gone with Pfizer like we did. Now none of that, of course, explains why cases are higher in China now that they were in the beginning of the pandemic, but The Washington Post doesn't want you to think about that. They want you to think about vaccines. It was all about vaccines. It turns out the Chinese have a pandemic of the unvaccinated too, and don't they deserve it?  

Speaking of news you may not be hearing about, a hot war is in progress 50 yards from Texas, which is an American state. No one seems to notice that either because we're focused on Ukraine. According to one report, a Mexican cartel engaged local authorities in a shootout for more than three hours. There were burning trucks with no one responding to them. That's a war.  

The U.S. Consulate has just warned Americans to avoid the area or secure shelter. That's our southern border, over which two million people flowed this year with no restraints whatsoever. Meanwhile, in our country, a convoy of American citizens dared to peacefully protest their own government as they assume the Constitution guaranteed them the right to do and yet they have been blocked unconstitutionally from entering their own capital city, Washington, D.C.  

It's not just truckers who are banned from entering Washington, D.C., it's everyone. D.C. police somehow were allowed to block off many exits yesterday to drivers for more than two hours. This is the same city that rewarded violent Black Lives Matter protesters with a mural.

So maybe you're for that, maybe you're not, but in normal times, that would be a big story because our constitutional rights are wrapped up in it and we should be debating what the limits of those rights are, how much power our politicians have, how much power we want them to have, but we're not because Ukraine, because you changed your Twitter name to the Ukrainian flag. 

It's the new crisis. You're not supposed to pay attention to any of the other crises, particularly here at home.

The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, addressed members of Congress today in a long and at times moving speech. Among other things, Zelenskyy demanded the United States shoot down Russian aircraft over his country.  

The White House has not yet agreed to do that, but things do seem to be moving very rapidly in that direction. Not long after Zelenskyy's address, Joe Biden announced the United States will send a total of at least a billion dollars of weapons to Ukraine just this week. Members of  from both parties then emerged to say they don't think that's enough. 

So, things are changing very fast. For weeks, leaders in Washington told us that an American-backed no-fly zone in Ukraine would be unwise because it would amount to an act of war against a nuclear-armed Russia. As you can see, those views have evolved a lot, but in fairness, Rep. Maria Salazar got there first.  

Salazar is a longtime news anchor from Miami, who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress as a Republican. She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. A week ago, a reporter from the GrayZone asked Salazar what she thought of a no-fly zone. Here's what she said:

I don't know what it will mean, but, you know, freedom is not free. Now, we made fun of that answer last week when we first showed you that clip, but now what we mocked is the consensus in Washington. 

We don't know what's going to happen. We've got to do it immediately. That's the argument you're hearing.  

At this point, no one wants to say it out loud, but it is true. At this point, a shooting war with Russia seems inevitable. How could war with Russia not be inevitable? Virtually everyone with power is for it. 

We remain against it. We think that joining a war in Eastern Europe will hurt this country, though to be clear, when and if that war starts, we will be praying passionately for America's total victory. Unlike so many in the foreign policy establishment, we love this country above all, and we mean it.

620	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-illegal-immigration-southern-border-worse	2022-03-17 23:35:00	Tucker Carlson: Illegal immigration across the southern border will soon get much worse | Fox News	" Fox News host voices his concerns over illegal immigration on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Houston, , is one of the rare, nice big cities left in this country. A little hot in the summer, but great people, very pretty neighborhoods and a lot going on. Thanks to the energy sector, biotech and aerospace, Houston has an enormous and still robust economy. It is hardly some dying mill town in the Northeast or the Upper Midwest. Your kids might want to move to Houston someday, maybe after college. It's not Baltimore. 

But all of a sudden Houston, Texas is starting to look a little more like Baltimore.  in Houston has gotten scary. The murder rate there has risen by more than 50% in just the last year. It's bad. Here's a local news report: 

I'm fearful just for my family to go outside the house. As you heard, that was the president of the police union in Houston, so he would know. It's amazing this is happening in all places in Houston, and what's so telling about this crime wave is how recently it began. 

Murders in Houston started to spike in a big way after  became president. Why is that exactly? Very simple answer: Joe Biden opened the southern border. Texas shares more than 1,200 miles of border with Mexico. There is a brutal cartel war underway in Mexico right now. It's been going on for a long time. Many of the combatants in that war have now moved north into Texas. They brought drugs with them. They've also brought machine guns. 

This fall, a felon opened fire on Houston police officers with a fully automatic rifle. You hear a lot about assault weapons. But the truth is authorities don't see fully automatic weapon weapons very often. They are heavily regulated, and typically they're owned by collectors. 

But automatic weapons are very common in war zones, and there is a war in Mexico. So, with no border in place, the cartels are bringing their armaments here. There are firefights in Houston.

That's automatic weapons, fire. It sounds like Syria or Mexico, but it's an apartment complex in Houston, Texas. We could go on if you know anybody who lives in Houston. Call and ask, How has your city changed recently? And they'll tell you. Open borders did this, Houston didn't do it to itself, this was done to Houston and not just to Houston, to so many places across this country where millions of illegal aliens have flooded in during Joe Biden's presidency. 

On Monday, for example, more than 100 illegal Haitian migrants landed in the  Keys in a single boat. Instances like this are no longer uncommon in the state of Florida. The world is coming to America's shores. Why? Because they're fully aware that the Biden administration is rewarding foreign nationals for violating our federal immigration law. It is an invasion. 

Huge numbers of Americans are dying as a result of that invasion. 100,000 dead last year of drug addicts. Most were killed by fentanyl that is trucked in from Mexico across open borders. Long term, there are massive labor market disruptions, there is evaporating social cohesion and so on. The costs of this have been beyond calculating, and this is exactly why no sane country opens its borders ever, ever, anywhere. 

What Joe Biden is doing right now has never been done, and it's about to get much worse. We're not guessing. Currently, a Trump era regulation called Title 42 allows the Border Patrol to turn illegal migrants back to Mexico on the grounds that there's a pandemic in progress, so we probably shouldn't let millions of people infected with COVID move here without permission. Seems sensible. But according to Democrats, this rule is racist because it might slow the human wave of migration. So for months, they've been demanding that the Biden administration suspend this rule. 

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: I urge President Biden and Secretary Mallorca's to immediately put a stop to these expulsions and to end this Title 42 policy at our southern border. We cannot continue these hateful and xenophobic Trump policies. 

REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE: In addition, a relic, Title 42, exists. It is a relic of the Trump administration. It was created to be mean-spirited. … Title 42, I ask for a suspension of it. 

SEN. ALEX PADILLA: I urge the Biden administration and my colleagues to remember the refugees who are waiting at our border, kept out by the cruel and unnecessary Title 42 policy. 

SEN. BOB MENENDEZ: Look, Title 42 is being used in a way that I think is indiscriminate and that violates the basic essence of our law. … But this process that the Biden administration has continued from the Trump administration in my mind is really inexcusable.

So, your kid has to wear a mask in school, but illegal aliens get to come here with no restrictions at all, despite the fact they may be infected with COVID because otherwise you're a racist. 

That's the case they were making, and so finally, inevitably, the Biden administration has caved. Turns out even trying to maintain basic public health standards is unacceptable if it gets in the way of increasing mass immigration. Title 42 is being nullified. 

A similar rule you should know will still apply to you. American citizens are not exempt to this day. You as a citizen are not allowed to return to the United States without permission from the CDC.  will sign off on that. So coming back to the country you were born in is no longer your birthright. But illegal aliens now face no barriers at all. And of course, they know it. Everyone knows it. It's not their fault. It's our president's fault. 

According to Axios, ""U.S. intelligence officials are privately bracing for a massive influx of more than 170,000 migrants at the Mexico border"" now that Title 42 is ending. 

So the wave grows, the total transformation of this country accelerates. So we've been very passive in the face of this, people make grumpy noises about it, no one's done anything. How should we respond? 

Well, the same way we respond to any other invasion. With the U.S. military. That's why countries have militaries to stop invasions, and this would not be a hard invasion to stop. Our military could seal the border with Mexico in days. That would save American lives. It would restore order. And it would end the invasion. 

Does that sound crazy like a misuse of the U.S. military? Well, keep in mind that  called in the US.. military to protect her from Trump voters at the U.S. Capitol. She treated our soldiers like her personal security detail. 

And then, of course, at this very moment, we are sending thousands of American troops and billions in military American military hardware to Eastern Europe to help Ukrainians restore their borders. So the obvious question is: Why not here? Why not take America's safety, your family's safety, as seriously as Nancy Pelosi takes her own safety? 

That seems like a fair question. Probably not  disinformation. Probably an honest question. We spoke to Rep. Maria Salazar in Miami last night, and we asked that question of her. She refused to answer. 

Oh, it's hypothetical. I've got a plan, right? How many plans have you heard about from Republicans for, say, the past twenty-five years? Many, many, many. 

To restate this is a highly dangerous situation that the Biden administration has placed our country in. Mexico, whatever its merits, is in the middle of a war, not a new war, a war that has raged on for more than a decade, a war that has likely killed more than 100,000 people so far. 

There are videos of trucks burning in the town of Nuevo Laredo. That's just feet from the U.S. border in the state of Texas. The video is the aftermath with three hour gun battle between cartels and government forces. The situation there is so chaotic that the trucks just burn in the middle of the road. No one comes to put out the fires to restore order to arrest anyone. 

So that's not a law enforcement action. That's a war. That's what wars are like. A few years ago, the Sinaloa cartel used heavy machine guns and armored vehicles to win a pitched battle against the Mexican military. That's a war, a civil war. Feet from our border. That's the country Joe Biden opened our border to. It's insanity. 

And yet somehow our Congress cannot be bothered to notice this, any of it, even as millions stream across. Murder victims in Houston, apparently don't have influential social media accounts, so Kevin McCarthy doesn't know that they exist. And that's a shame because when he sees that on Tik Tok, he acts. 

Here's McCarthy demanding we send military equipment across the world to stop the invasion of another country:

So McCarthy says of the Ukrainians, it's a war they didn't create, and that is certainly true. The Ukrainians did not create that war. The Ukrainians did not invade their own country. But we didn’t either. We didn't invade our own country. Very few Americans wanted to open our border to a narco state in the middle of a drug war. Joe Biden did that to us. 

And no one cares. So maybe we need our own Zelensky to get the world's attention and stop the invasion of America. Who will that be?

621	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-americans-poor-economy-inflation-biden	2022-03-18 23:43:00	Tucker: People are becoming poorer | Fox News	"Fox News host voices his concerns over inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

There are a lot of things going on around the world at the moment, but we thought we would begin tonight with a report from your own country just to give you something a little different from what you've been watching every moment of every day for the past three weeks.  

On your screen are pictures from Brooklyn, New York. These are people waiting in line at a food bank. The queue stretches for blocks. It's what we used to call a bread line. Most of these people are not homeless or not addicted to drugs. Some of them have jobs. They just can't afford enough food. Very few living Americans have ever seen anything like this. It's been nearly 100 years since the United States experienced widespread food shortages. That's long enough that most of us have forgotten what it means.  

Here's what it means. If you want to make a society volatile, not just angry and divided, which is where we are now, but revolutionary and explosive, then you threaten the food supply. More governments have fallen to rising food prices than to any other cause by far. Hungry people are dangerous.  

The Biden administration doesn't seem to notice this is happening or acknowledge it. Like all neoliberals, they treat unchanging truths about anything as heresy. They censor them and shut them down. They live in an entirely ideological world that they created. They believe reality conforms to their theories, not the other way around. And why wouldn't they think that? If you can change your sex just by wishing it so, you can probably eliminate inflation simply by pretending it doesn't exist. When you're God, there are no limits.  

The problem is they're not God. They're not even very capable economists. More than a decade of reckless fiscal policies have devalued the U.S. dollar to the point that middle-class people can barely survive in the United States. Now, the suffering of regular Americans doesn't have the thrilling imminence of, say, war footage from Ukraine, but it's real and it matters. Here's what it looks like in number terms.  

This year, according to a new estimate, rising inflation will cost the average American family $3,500 in extra post-tax income. Now, that might be bearable if you make $250,000 a year, though you would notice it, but if you make $35,000 a year, that's a disaster. You will radically change the way you live. Your standard of living will plummet, and that's exactly what millions of Americans are facing right now. It's not a talking point. It's real.  

Americans for Tax Reform found that between November of 2020 and November of 2021, ""The bottom 20 percent of earners spent $309 more on food, $761 more on energy, $476 more on shelter, $390 more on other commodities, and $224 more on other services."" Those are the numbers from November. They've risen dramatically since then, and they're continuing to rise.  

Nationally, meat, poultry, fish, eggs — up 13 percent. In San Francisco, a dozen eggs is almost $5. Orange juice in Miami is over 4 bucks, so is a chicken breast in Boston. A pound of ground beef hamburger in L.A. is $6.34. A pound of bacon in New York City is $7.28.  

In Chicago last year, green grapes cost $2.50 a pound; now they're $4. The price of chicken wings in the Catskills went from $8 to $20. Order something else. If you tried to drink a pint of Guinness in California yesterday to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, it cost you $8.55 for a pint of beer. Prices of everything are rising far faster than wages are — a lot faster — and that means that in very real terms, the most real, people are becoming poorer, and not just people who buy things (consumers), but also people who sell them (retailers). This is a disaster for small business.  

Did you catch it at the end? Prices changing every three days. It's like Weimar or Zimbabwe. That is not the picture of a stable economy, and it's not just food that's moving fast. In the city of Baltimore, the cost of electricity has risen 18 percent in a single year. That does not happen with utilities, but it just did. In Philadelphia, the average utility bill rose from $477 a month to $651 a month.  

According to the National Association of Home Builders, building material prices increased almost 21 percent year over year. Overall, lumber prices alone have added almost $19,000 to the price of a home in the past six months. That's one of the reasons housing prices are so high, and then, of course, there's gasoline. In Los Angeles, it now costs about $180 to fill a Chevy Suburban. One tank of gas, $180. Nationally, gas is up nearly 40 percent, and here's what that looks like.  

Rising gas prices make people desperate. You wouldn't know that from watching television because most people who bring you the news don't know what the price of gas is, and a lot of them don't care because they don't drive themselves. But the rest of the country cares very deeply what the price of gas is, and in some places, the problem is so bad, gas prices are so expensive, that thieves have taken to drilling holes in gas tanks to steal it.  

Contrary to what you may have learned from Sandy Cortez's TikTok feed, the internal combustion engine is not a sin. It's not the basis of a moral crisis. It is a miracle upon which all civilization rests. Your Amazon package arrives because of gasoline, so does your Uber Eats. You can fly to see your relatives across the country because of gasoline. So, when the price of gasoline rises, everyone is affected — no matter who they voted for and no matter whether they notice it directly or not. Here's how people in the state of Texas are reacting to the rising gas prices.  

Will the capital of Ukraine fall to the Russians? We certainly hope not. Americans care about that. How high will gas get? Americans care about that even more. They care deeply because it affects their lives so dramatically, and yet the coverage of this is not proportionate. You almost never hear anybody ask, ""What do you think of the price of gas?"" But if you leave the TV studios of New York, Los Angeles and Washington, you will find people really do care.  

Every product in this country, with some exceptions, but not that many, is delivered thanks to gasoline, and that means with rising gas prices, all products become more expensive. The cheapest washing machine you can buy at a, say, Best Buy in South Carolina right now — $450. Furniture and bedding across the country is 17 percent more expensive than it was a year ago.  

Twelve months ago, a 28-cubic-foot Samsung stainless steel fridge was selling for $1,700 bucks at Home Depot. It's now $2,000, and so on for everything, and particularly for vehicles. The average price of a used car is up more than 30 percent nationally. It's up 35 percent in Massachusetts and Tennessee. It's up 38 percent in Florida and Maryland. It's up 40 percent or more in Louisiana, New York, Montana and North Dakota.  

That means the average cost of a used car in the state of Montana is now more than $42,000 — for a used car, some with high mileage. By comparison, last March, the average used Toyota sold for $20,000. The average used Toyota now goes for $28,000. These are real numbers with real effects. To restate: The standard of living of Americans, who for almost 100 years have enjoyed the world's highest standard of living in any big country, is plummeting. So, what's the administration doing to fix this? What are they doing to help? Well, of course, that depends upon whether or not you're Ukrainian. If you are, they can help you. If you're not, our transportation secretary recommends you take the bus.  

Take the bus? Yeah, homeless schizophrenics have been doing it for generations. Why shouldn't you? You can't afford to drive. That's the transportation secretary. So maybe the first question would be: What are you going to do about gas prices, pal? The roads are falling apart, maybe you could fix that. No, one of the tools in our toolkit is you can ride the bus with the crazy people and you'll like it. That's not their only plan to fight inflation. Their other plan? Blame others.  

You just heard from someone who's a sitting United States senator, whose total reservoir of knowledge about the world is smaller than the sink in your powder room. This is someone who knows literally nothing about how anything works. The meat industry? What would that be, Sen. Warren? She has no idea what she's talking about. She has no interest in learning why the dollar is less valuable than it was 10 years ago, and she has no interest whatsoever in improving your life.  

So, the question once again is: How long can this continue? It's one thing to pretend that boys can compete in girls' sports, and that's totally natural; it's always the way it's been. That may be offensive to people, but when they can't afford to buy groceries, boy, you are really teetering on the edge of something awful. They should wake up, soon.

622	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ukraine-leaders-lying	2022-03-21 23:49:00	Tucker Carlson: We have a right to know what's going on in Ukraine, but our leaders are lying | Fox News	" Fox News host discusses whether Ukraine is a democracy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

What exactly is democracy? Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion they want to have. They can express any opinion they want in public whenever they care to express it, including through mass media. If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, they can challenge their leaders for office. Now, all of these things are true in every free country, in any period, always.  

These are not just features of democracy. These are prerequisites for democracy. So, with that in mind, you should know about a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Platform for Life. With 43 seats in parliament, it is the largest opposition party in that country. Over the weekend, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, banned that party. Opposition Platform for Life is now prohibited from ""all activity within Ukraine."" 

So, with a single command, Zelenskyy made it impossible for anybody to run against him for president. He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, but to ten other political parties that he believed were insufficiently loyal to him. They're all illegal now. Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine, and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law, but we must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. 

Opposition Platform for Life, for example, denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, just like everybody else. But Zelenskyy took the opportunity to turn Ukraine into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. So having banned all opposition, he then seized control of the country's media outlets. Zelenskyy signed a decree that combines all national television channels into a single platform that he controls. He described this as a ""unified information policy,"" and it certainly is unified. 

So, if all of these details seem shocking to you, if this is not the Zelenskyy you've heard about on the Today Show, then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been solidifying complete control over Ukraine for a long time, since long before the Russian invasion and the war. Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested and his assets seized by the state. At the same time, Zelenskyy shut down three of Ukraine's most popular television networks—channels that, not coincidentally, had criticized him.  

So, how should we as Americans assess this? Well, first and most obviously, by admitting this is authoritarianism, it's not democracy. Then second, by acknowledging that actually it's pretty common around the world. Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. Most countries are still governed by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it, and that includes close American allies. The kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, but there are others. We're not moralizing about this, by the way. Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere in every country, but as Americans, it's probably a waste of time to get too involved in the internal affairs of other countries. They're hard to change.  

What we care about, what all Americans should care about is what happens here in the United States. The United States is, despite the fact it's also a bumper sticker doesn't make it untrue, is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. How do we maintain that inspiring position? Not simply by sending people missiles, but by remaining free ourselves. The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, of light, in the world if we are not free.  

So that's the first thing we do if we want to inspire and change the world, Ukraine included, is make sure that we stay free. And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried by your leader's response to what's happening in Ukraine, the growing dictatorship there, and that's the word for it. What's another word for it? If you have ideas, send it to us.  

On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar and Atlantic Magazine pundit David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim: ""Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that, under the pressure of war, is becoming 'more' tolerant and 'more' liberal."" 

Right, so when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, that's called tolerance. It's called democracy. Don't take the word of a single Canadian warmonger, propagandist. David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that. All of Washington is telling you that. Watch. 

These people. So, the man who just declared himself king is actually the world's newest George Washington. OK, so you could be deeply concerned and deeply saddened, outraged by what's happening to Ukrainians without saying things like that, because it's absurd. It's a lie. That's the word from Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Republican. And again, on one level, you can understand why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy when they talk about Ukraine. Why wouldn't they be? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. It was wrong. The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. We're watching it on TV. It's horrifying.  

So, it's entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians to expel the invaders, and obviously we are rooting for them to expel the invaders, Russia. But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people and all the people you saw on TV,—""we care so much""—you wouldn't want them to live under a dictator, so you'd be highly upset about what Zelenskyy just did, but our leaders are not upset in the slightest. They're cheering it on even when they know better. So, some of it is too dumb to know, but some of them do know.  

Michael McFaul, for example. He's Barack Obama's ambassador to Russia. Unlike shallow gasbags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe. He has lived there. He knows exactly who Zelenskyy is and exactly what he's doing. So, here's his assessment of the Ukrainian government, not the people, the government, as of this afternoon. ""If Zelenskyy remains in power, Ukrainian democracy is preserved."" 

That guy teaches at Stanford. But that's not true. So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, and we oppose that, we should oppose that, but that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. It's not and we shouldn't tell Americans it is because that's a lie. We should tell the truth, but virtually no one is telling the truth. Everyone is lying.  

So why? Why is everyone lying? Why not just say, ""Look, it's outrageous that Russia did this and....we like Ukraine better. We're going to support Ukraine."" Fine. Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine is a model democracy when it's not at all? Why are they doing that? Maybe because Ukraine now has exactly the sort of democracy they'd like to see here in the United States. They hate to think that could be true. It's scary to think that's true, but ask yourself. Play this word game. If they can find a ""national security pretext"" for a war, for example, do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second before banning their political opponents for running for office in this country? Do you think they would hesitate before pulling this show off the air forever? No, of course not. They'd do it in a flash. Then they call it democracy.  

So, maybe you're starting to conclude these people love Zelenskyy, not because he represents the Ukrainian people, but because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint. Maybe that's what's going on. It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. Now, of course, we pray they never have the power to do any of that in this country, the last free country in the world. We should not let them do that because freedom in America is not just important to us, our children and grandchildren. It's important to the globe. Again, we are the last free country. We must remain free.  

In the meantime, a war is being waged in America's name with our money, so it's fair to ask how the side we are backing is doing. Clearly, there are an awful lot of heroic Ukrainian citizens. We see them all the time on television. We applaud them. We admire them, but how is the government doing? How is it behaving? Again, we have a right to know, even if state-controlled media in Ukraine won't report it, even if our sort of state-controlled media here downplays it, dismisses it. Here's a man called Gennadiy Druzenko. Druzenko was a medic in charge of a field hospital in Ukraine. He's appeared on CNN. Here, he casually announces that he has ordered the castration of captured Russian soldiers. Watch. 

Cockroaches, not people. Now again, that doesn't mean the broader Ukrainian cause is unjust. It is just. They were invaded. They have a right to fight back and expel the Russians from their country and for the fifth time, we're rooting for that. But we're paying for this. So, we have a right to know exactly what's happening. We have an absolute right to know. In fact, we have a constitutional right to free media. We don't have that. That video, by the way, disappeared. People on the internet managed to get a copy of it. You may hear it dismissed as Russian propaganda, just like Hunter Biden's laptop was or the 2016 presidential election results in this country were, but it's not Russian propaganda. It's real.  

The man you just saw speaking has confirmed the video is authentic. He apologized for it. So murdering POWs is a war crime, so is castrating them. We're not shocked by this. This happens that a lot of countries. Ukraine is not unique. Atrocities happen during war, every war, always, no matter what the neo cons may tell you, but this is a war that we are paying for.  

This is a war with moral implications. This is a war the White House is involved in at every level. So, when the Ukrainian government does something, we have an interest in knowing exactly what it is and what it means, but more than anything, we have an overriding interest and a moral obligation to keep the United States free. So, when you see them admire someone who's shutting down any opposition to him, you should pause.

As if this country's core institutions have not been degraded or diminished enough with pregnant flight suits and an FBI that behaves like Nancy Pelosi's pretorian guard, as if that weren't bad enough, Joe Biden announced in January his plan to choose the next Supreme Court justice on the basis of appearance. The Supreme Court. You never thought that would happen. The sociology department, maybe. Your company, perhaps. But the Supreme Court really matters.  

What does appearance have to do with ability or fealty to the Constitution? Joe Biden never explained. He did indicate, to be fair, that he would prefer a lawyer for the job, maybe even a clever one, but mostly he said he wanted a Black woman—genetics being the single most important factor in we used to call judicial temperament.  

How does that work, exactly? How did genes determine your ability as a Supreme Court justice or a surgeon or an airline pilot or anything else? We would love to hear Joe Biden explain that, but he didn't. Instead, he embarked on a predictably short nationwide search for such a candidate and located in the end, a person called Ketanji Brown Jackson. Her confirmation hearings continue today for the second day. Not surprisingly, given how she got this job, most of the talk in Washington was not about what she's done, how she thinks, what she's like as a person, but instead about how she looks. It's not shallow or anything. Here's the shallowest of all: Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. 

""I grew up in a small, Black church."" No, you didn't. Another lecture about the Black experience from a blue-eyed Yale graduate who, in fact, grew up in an all-White town, the son of IBM executives. Is there anyone on this planet phonier than Cory Booker? Ketanji Brown Jackson doesn't seem quite so fraudulent. That would be impossible, but she does, and this is the key, share a resume that is strikingly similar to Cory Booker's—daughter of academics, graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, on the board of the single wokest day school in Washington, D.C., etc. You know exactly how that story turns out, because in the end, when they tell you you're getting a Black nominee, they're not talking about the son of a maid and a farm worker from Pinpoint, Georgia. In fact, we already have a Supreme Court justice like that. His name is Clarence Thomas. He's a great man, even if no one in Washington will acknowledge that.  

No, what they mean when they tell you you're getting a Black Supreme Court justice is that you're getting yet another Democratic Party robot with the same rigid and totally predictable views as your average professional class White liberal, but who happens to be tanner than Joe Biden. So identical, identical to everyone else in power, just a different shade. And the shade, to be fair, does make all the difference. That's the whole point of the exercise. Because of the way that she looks, Brown Jackson, who again is just a garden variety White liberal in what she believes, but because of the way she looks, this nominee will get nowhere near the vetting of a typical Supreme Court justice and that, whatever your politics are, is a shame.  

As Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post put it four years ago, when Democrats were baselessly accusing a Republican nominee of rape, ""when a Supreme Court seat is on the line, the court and the country deserve the benefit of the doubt, not the nominee. "" All right. We're kind of on board with that, actually, but that was yesterday's standard. Today, not surprisingly, that same newspaper, Jeff Bezos' personal newspaper, announced a new position. 

The Post, put it this way in a headline: ""How low will the GOP go in taking on Ketanji Brown Jackson?"" 

Pretty funny. It's low to ask questions of a Supreme Court nominee, but we're not deterred. We believe in standards on the show. The Supreme Court is, of course, one of those powerful institutions in the world. Joe Biden did not create the , previous generations did, hundreds of years ago. He does not own it. He merely inherited it for a short time and so the rest of us have an interest in who sits on it and who interprets our Constitution. Joe Biden, sounding maybe a touch defensive, has described Ketanji Brown Jackson as one of this country's great legal minds and we certainly want to believe that for real, given that she's probably going to be confirmed no matter what we think.  

The question is: Is it true? Is she really one of this country's great legal minds? One way to know, one indication, would be her LSAT scores. The LSAT is not a knowledge test. It measures logic and reasoning ability, and no one doubts it's an accurate measure of those things, which predict legal skills and that's why top law firms, law schools, have long used that test. So, how did Ketanji Brown Jackson do on the LSAT? Sorry, you're not allowed to ask because asking is racism. 

""It's repugnant."" ""It's incredibly offensive."" ""She's a top legal mind."" Shut up. We don't have to show you proof. You're not allowed to ask for proof. It's hilarious. So, here you've got Mazie Hirono, the Senate's dumbest member. We don't need to ask for her test scores. We know we know what they are. She's infuriated that anyone would suggest that Judge Jackson was nominated because of a race and sex after Joe Biden bragged repeatedly that Judge Jackson was nominated for her race and sex. It's too funny. They demand that you listen to them very carefully, but they become apoplectic if you dare to repeat what they say. What's the message here? Shut up. You're not allowed to talk. No more insulin, surf. 

Sorry, not playing along. Thankfully, in the hearings today, a few senators did manage to ask relevant questions. Here's Josh Hawley: 

Hmm. Well, that's pretty serious. Why did you do that, Judge Jackson? Well, here was the response:  

Now we'll just concede upfront, we are not world-renowned legal minds, or even technically lawyers on this show. But we're going to try to understand what the judge just said. So, Congress has passed a law saying possessing a lot of kiddy porn is a very serious crime and then an invention, the internet, comes along and makes it easier to collect a lot more kiddy porn. So, according to noted legal mind, Ketanji Brown Jackson, that somehow makes the act of possessing a lot of kiddy porn less bad. In other words, since the internet makes it simple, we're not going to punish you as much. Maybe we're misinterpreting what she said. That seems to be what she said. Does that make sense?  

If not, it helps to understand in the clip you just saw that Judge Brown was not articulating some legal principle related to the Constitution that we could generalize across our code. She was instead constructing a carve out for a narrow and specific group of criminals, sex offenders. It's not the first time. It's one of many such carve outs she has argued for during her career. In 1996, for example, Ketanji Brown Jackson argued in the Harvard Law Review against sex offender registry laws. Here was her reasoning: ""If a community notification statute deprives the (sex) offender of his right to mobility or bodily integrity, and if it makes him the target of widespread community rejection, antipathy, and scorn"" then according to Ketanji Brown Jackson, that would be unconstitutional.  

Hmm. Why is it unconstitutional? She didn't explain. Is that a sound legal argument? And why is Judge Jackson so fixated on defending sexual predators? What does the FBI think of that? Well, funny you asked about the FBI. This show has just obtained an email from the FBI's Los Angeles Women and Black Affairs Committee. 

It was sent out to every FBI agent in the FBI's L.A. field office on March 11th, this month. It is an invitation to ""a nomination party for Ketanji Brown Jackson."" Join us for ""lots of celebrating,"" the invitation reads. Now, the party was set for March 23rd in an FBI conference room. 

Kristi Koons Johnson, the assistant director in charge of the L.A. field office, is the featured speaker. Huh? This is a nominee. This is someone who doesn't have the job, whose nomination is, by definition, a political question. The Senate votes on it, that's in the Constitution, by the way. And the FBI is weighing in with both feet on their choice, which is Ketanji Brown Jackson. So, we should tell you the next day, the FBI's Diversity and Inclusion Office issued what it called an update. ""The FBI must remain neutral in all political nomination and confirmation processes. Accordingly, a party for any nominee in FBI space would be inappropriate. (We) apologize for any misunderstanding surrounding the publicity for this event. "" 

Misunderstanding surrounding publicity. Not that we did it, but that you somehow misunderstood the publicity. Right? No, there was no publicity, we just read the invitation. The update included a new flier for the same party that removed any mention of Brown Jackson. 

It's not a misunderstanding. They just said out loud what everyone already knows. The FBI is a political force and has decided they're on the side of Ketanji Brown Jackson. So, if you've got the White House and the Congress and the FBI, our three main power centers behind Ketanji Brown Jackson, she'll probably get the job. Sorry. But we'd still like to see her LSAT score.

624	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ketanji-brown-jackson	2022-03-23 23:45:00	Tucker Carlson: Answering this question should have been simple for Ketanji Brown Jackson | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson not defining what a woman is on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

In the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee asked Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Jackson, what should have been the easiest question ever posed. Can you define what a woman is? Now imagine. Put yourself in her position and imagine how relieved Jackson must have been when she heard that question. Here, she stayed up all night trying to memorize obscure case law from 19th century and court precedent and when she finally gets to the hearing room, all the Republicans want is a recap of day one of ninth grade biology. What's a woman?  

For a world-famous scholar like Ketanji Jackson, that should have been effortless. Talk about slow and steady right down the plate. ""A woman,"" Jackson might have said, looking incredulous, ""That's simple. A woman is a human being with two X chromosomes. Ask any geneticist. It's detectable in a blood test, but if you're still confused by what a woman is, you can ask a doctor. Women have wider pelvises and different bone structures from men, not to mention very different genitalia. It's usually pretty obvious that women, just by looking at them, women are built differently because their bodies are designed to do different things. Nature is real. Women, menstruate. Women give birth and then breastfeed. Men do not do these things because they can't. Not a single man in all human history has ever had his period or delivered a baby and I know this, senator, because I'm a woman myself. In fact, that's why I'm here. Joe Biden nominated me to the Supreme Court because I am female, and he has said so himself many times. The president knows exactly what a woman is. If he didn't know, he wouldn't have picked me, obviously. So please, Senator Blackburn, do not waste my time. With all respect, that is an incredibly stupid question."" 

Imagine if she said that, what an answer that would have been. Do you know a single person wouldn't have cheered? We would have. Honesty is a wonderful thing to watch, no matter where it comes from, but that is not what Ketanji Jackson said. Here was her actual answer:  

""Oh, I'm not a biologist."" You following this? So, only a biologist is allowed to tell you what a woman is and Ketanji Jackson, incredibly impressive as they tell us she is, is not, she just reminded us, a biologist. Not that would make any difference if she were a biologist because no one the Democratic Party cares what biologists think about biological sex. Biologists have been banned along with a lady who writes Harry Potter novels.  

In 2022, the power of science and literature crumble in the face of the trans lobby. So, actually, Ketanji Jackson's academic credentials are not, strictly speaking, all that relevant here, but still pause for a second and marinate in the awe-inspiring stupidity of her answer. ""What's a woman? I don't know. I'm not a biologist."" Oh, we see how this works.  

Hey, Ketanji Jackson, is it raining? I don't know. I'm not a meteorologist.  

How would you respond to someone who said something like that? You'd probably give up and find someone else to talk to. That person was not capable of conversation. So, last night we said we wanted to see Ketanji Jackson's LSAT scores. That's no longer necessary. We can say with certainty she is clearly a sub genius and probably shouldn't be on the Supreme Court. What's a woman? Definitely the most revealing question ever asked in a Senate confirmation hearing and one of the many things it reveals is how utterly the Democratic Party as an institution has changed in just four years. 

It's a mile marker that tells us the evolution of the party. So, during the last Supreme Court nomination, you'll remember, we were commanded to believe that all women must be believed regardless of whether or not they were telling the truth. They're women, therefore in the name of social justice, you must accept whatever they say at face value. A woman's word is like a sworn affidavit. You can take it to the bank. Here's Kamala Harris to explain:  

How amusing is it to see Kamala Harris say, ""let's speak the truth."" Throw a beer can at the TV if you agree. So, to recap, in 2019, it was ""a sham and a disgrace"" to doubt a woman's word because, by the virtue of their biology, women did not lie. That's what it was to be a woman—utterly truthful all the time. Joe Biden agreed with this. Women were very different from men inherently. He told us so and that's why you weren't allowed to hit them. 

All right, so we mocked him. ""Keep punching at it."" Domestic abuse it is. We made fun of him, but he was on to something. Actually, what he said was entirely true. Ask yourself: Two men get in a bar fight, one of them punches the other in the face. What's your response to that? ""Come on, guys. Take it outside."" A man and a woman get in a bar fight. The man punches the woman in the face. What's your response to that? Well, if you're a normal human being, you're horrified. Punching a woman in the face is not just a felony—though it is—it is a moral crime. Decent people don't punch women in the face, period. A man's best instinct is to protect women. That's nothing to be ashamed of. It makes a civilization civilized. That's why we don't send expectant mothers into battle. Got that, you degraded freaks?  

Pregnant flight suits are an attempt to make us deny our most basic instinct, an instinct that we should not be ashamed of. Joe Biden had this instinct. He noted it. He was absolutely right. Why was he right? Because men and women are not the same. We're not saying one is morally better than the other. They're morally equal, but they're different on the deepest levels, beginning with biology. Every person on Earth knows this is true. We are born knowing it, but now they're commanding you to pretend otherwise, to deny nature and suppress your most basic and valuable instincts.  

They're telling you, you have no right to be more upset when a woman is injured or a woman gets her ear bitten off in a bar fight than when a man does. Are you ready to suppress those instincts? Are you ready to live in a society that won't acknowledge them? What happens to our justice system if we pretend men and women are exactly the same or don't exist? Ketanji Jackson's claim that we can't say who's a man who's a woman will transform the way we administer justice, starting with our vast regime of anti-discrimination law.  

If we can't say for certain who's a woman, how are we going to enforce Joe Biden's famous Violence Against Women Act? Why do we have such an act? Who would care? How can we set aside a huge percentage of federal contracts for women-owned companies if we don't know what a woman is? Oh, I guess that scam is going to have to end tomorrow because it no longer makes any sense and, by the way, how is sexism even a meaningful category in a world in which sex has no meaning? Well, it's not. Why have Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in schools? If we don't have biological sex, how can we have discrimination on the basis of biological sex? Thinking this through?  

The Trump administration thought it through. Actually, they saw this coming. We should tell you that. The Trump White House tried to preserve Title IX by arguing that the concept of sex as defined in that law derives from biology, not from how you're feeling about your personal identity on any particular day. That's the case they made. In response to that, they were denounced right-wing lunatics. The ACLU declared that, ""The Trump administration is trying to erase trans people."" 

Really? Maybe it was bigger than that. Now, the Biden administration is in charge of everything, and in less than a year, the worst, most fervent predictions have come entirely true. Female athletes are losing NCAA championships to men dressing up as women in order to cheat their way to victory. Every person in America sees this happening. Very few are brave enough to say a word about it, but here's one of them. This is a woman who happened to be watching an NCAA swimming championship in which a male swimmer going by the name of Lia Thomas dominated every woman in the pool:  

We'd love to have her on. ""I'm not a vet, but I know what a dog is."" Yes, you do. We all do. Even Ketanji Jackson knows she's had a few children of her own. She probably learned exactly how the process works. The point of the trans movement isn't to convince anyone that biology isn't real. They're not even trying. That's an impossible case to make. You would sound ridiculous if you tried to articulate that, much less explain it.  

The point of this exercise is very different. The point is to make the rest of us repeat a lie, to say something we know perfectly well is not true. ""Yes, Lia Thomas is a proud, beautiful woman who won the swim meet because she practiced harder than the other girls. Lia Thomas deserved to win. Her victory wasn't cheating and no, I don't notice her bulging swimsuit. I have no idea what you're talking about."" That's what they demand you say, not because they care about Lia Thomas or any other trans person. They couldn't care less. Making you pretend to believe something you don't, that's the point, because if they can make you pretend to believe something you know is untrue, they've won. They control your brain.  

So, this isn't about trans people. It's about all of us and the stakes are very high and that's why the censorship is so intense. Have you noticed? Our national conversation about transgenderism is completely defined by censorship, by making you shut up, not allowing you to notice the obvious is why they're doing it. There's no attempt to persuade you. There's no fact-based argument. You can't respond, ""Oh, so men can become women just by wishing it. So, tell us how that works. Can I stop male pattern baldness the same way? Can I grow six inches? Please explain how this remarkable new power the trans community has discovered might apply to me. Can I do it too?"" 

The power of positive thinking! Well, that's a fair question. They'll never answer it. They'll just make you be quiet. Their first move always is censorship and their second move, inevitably, is punishment. We learn that again last night when we were suspended from Twitter. ""We have determined that this account violated the Twitter rules specifically for violating our rules against hateful conduct,"" Twitter wrote to us. The only way out of Twitter jail was to delete our tweet, to pretend we never said it, to cleanse America's conscience by just whiting out the past.  

What was our crime, by the way? Well, we dared to highlight two accounts that Twitter has banned: Charlie Kirk and the Babylon bee. There was nothing hateful about either one. We'd say look them up, but you can't because they're gone now, but both merely noted that biological sex is fixed at birth. This has been universally acknowledged by those homo sapiens for at least 300,000 years. So, it was a factual statement, but on Twitter, as in our public life, truth is no defense.  

Twitter is now run by a man called Parag Agrawal, who has said plainly he does not believe in free speech. Agrawal came to this country as an adult to get a degree from Stanford. Now, Agrawal controls the single most important forum for America's political conversation. That is a big and important job. It's such a public company. It's much more than that. It's a kind of public trust that allows us democracy to function. So, you would think you'd want a guy like that, in a position like that, to have some respect for his adopted country's core institutions, beginning with and primarily the First Amendment, but Agrawal has no respect for First Amendment or our Constitution. He explained that openly in a 2020 speech. 

Oh, so the new standard isn't your right as a citizen to say what you believe is true. The new standard is achieving something called healthy public conversation. By the way, this is not one man's opinion. You grew up in a country where people are free to say what they wanted, but now that political speech, in fact, all speech is disseminated to other citizens via social media, this is the guy who actually controls what you're allowed to think.  

So, what is healthy public conversation? What does that mean, exactly? We're interested, so we texted Parag Agrawal very first thing this morning and then we emailed his office and then him personally, all to find out. Agrawal was too cowardly to respond to us. So, we're going to have to assume that a healthy public conversation is whatever Parag Agrawal wants it to be. He decides the meaning.  

In other words, a single man who has total and undisguised contempt for America's most basic values gets to decide what Americans are allowed to talk about. Parag Agrawal doesn't think you should know about Hunter Biden's laptop. That's unhealthy. So, he censors the story. You don't get to see it. He doesn't think you should be allowed to discuss basic biology in public. We're erasing all science because it's unhealthy. So, now you're not allowed to talk about it. In fact, you're banned, silenced, censored. 

We can't control Parag Agrawal, but we can't ask: how do you feel about this new standard?  

Not so long ago, this was a free country. Now Parag Agrawal and nine other billionaires, whose names you might not even know, who certainly were not elected to anything, get to determine the limits of your conversations. Are we okay with this? What happened to all the Liberals and the self-described civil libertarians we used to have in America? They don't seem to be fighting the power anymore. They seem to have joined it.  

How about Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and everyone else who's constantly lecturing the serfs about democracy? Is this the kind of democracy they're talking about? A democracy in which a tiny sliver of very rich people control everything, including your mind. Doesn't sound like democracy. It sounds suspiciously like oligarchy. Don't you think? They can let us know. All those people are welcome on that this show any time, including and very much including you, Parag Agrawal. We promise a healthy public conversation.

625	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-cory-booker-slobbered-all-over-supreme-court-nominee	2022-03-24 23:03:00	Tucker: Cory Booker just slobbered all over the Supreme Court nominee | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the the confirmation hearings of Ketanji Brown Jackson on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We're trying to find things to be happy about and actually, if you look hard enough, there are a lot of them. One of the best things about, say, a Supreme Court confirmation hearing is that you get to see the U.S. Senate in action and this is new. If you're like most people, you know, the Senate has 100 members or two from every state, and you know that they're somehow important. They're in the Constitution. So, they wear dark suits and red ties to work. They talk about laws. Every summer, they fly to foreign countries and act like they're president. Some of them you may even know by name—the famous ones like Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, obviously, the publicity addicts like Lindsey Graham and of course, the ones you see on your own ballot every six years.  

So, that's what you know. But do you really know these people? Who are they, really? What are they like? Well, unless you happen to live next door to one or you watch an inordinate amount of C-SPAN, it's hard to know what they're like and that's why confirmation hearings are so great. You get to see U.S. senators in their natural habitat. It turns out there are confirmation hearings underway right now, you may have heard about them, for a Biden appointee called Ketanji Jackson. Jackson is a world-renowned legal genius who, for reasons that are still not clear, cannot determine what a woman is. We told you about her last night. But so far, the star of these hearings has not been Ketanji Jackson. It's been a junior senator from New Jersey called Cory Booker.  

Now, like Ketanji Jackson, Cory Booker is also a world-famous legal scholar, hence his seat on the Judiciary Committee. Booker attended not only Stanford and Yale Law School, but then went all the way to Oxford University in England on the coveted Rhodes Scholarship. He has quite a resume. If academic credentials still had any connection to ability or achievement, Cory Booker would be a very impressive person, but in his case, we're going to have to grade on a curve because Cory Booker has come a long way. 

Cory Booker is from a world you have never been to. He's from a hard, unforgiving world of crime, decay and raw urban authenticity. Cory Booker is from the streets of . He once described his world in an interview, ""I still remember my first month on the street,"" he said. ""I walked up to this charismatic Black guy my age called T-Bone, who was one of the drug lords. I said, 'Yo, man, what's up?' And he leaped up and for me, looked me right in the eye and said, 'Who the blank do you think you are? If you ever so much as, look at me again, I'm going to put a cap in your a--."" 

Now, T-Bone, as you probably concluded, was one of Newark's most notorious drug lords. As Joe Biden might have said, he was a bad dude. But Cory Booker is a bad dude too in his own way and the two became close. The Rhodes Scholar and the crack slinger, united by a common love of the street. But then inevitably, tragedy struck. Cory Booker learned that T-Bone was on the lam from the law. By this point. Cory Booker was the mayor of Newark, so the friendship couldn't last. As Booker later recalled with sadness, ""that rift between me and T-Bone was inches. We sat there, but I felt so alienated that there was a gulf is why is the Grand Canyon between us and I could not reach out to save this young man, and we drove back to a housing project called Brick Towers, and I've never seen him again since that day."" 

It's a poignant story, but Cory Booker isn't alone. No one has seen T-Bone since that day. In fact, no one has ever seen T-Bone at any point ever because T-Bone doesn't exist. As we later learned, T-Bone is a fictional character. Cory Booker made him up entirely, but Cory Booker didn't stop there. He also invented his own identity.  

It turns out that Cory Booker is not a product of the streets of Newark, not even close. He is, in fact, a blue-eyed rich kid from an all-White suburb. His parents were IBM executives. Now you can judge, but you have to concede that whatever else he is, Cory Booker is a remarkable actor. He is the Jussie Smollett of Democratic politics. A fraud? Yes, but a deeply committed one, a man who has honed his skills and those skills have been on full display this week as Booker has imploded all over Ketanji Jackson. Now Jackson is an oppressed member of the professional class too. She went to Harvard and Harvard Law School. So, the two of them have a lot in common. Watch their solidarity.  

Did we make that up? Do we create that? That actually happened in the United States. "" Service, Service, Service."" That's what we call hard edge striving, though. ""It's service,"" but the best was at the end, ""Don't worry my sister."" Wait a second. They're related? Well, apparently they are, at least in some hard-to-define spiritual sense. They have definitely seen each other at Whole Foods or on the flight to Edgartown.  

For decades, these two pioneers have followed virtually identical paths. Both grew up in white-collar families. Both went to multiple elite schools. Neither one has ever left the tiny world of credential mongering NPR listeners who run this country. Now, it's been a struggle for both of them, but they've made it. At this point, they're just sick and tired of being sick and tired. Cory Booker chokes up thinking about the journey. 

That's not Jussie Smollett? Did you see the footage from the sentencing? That's not Jussie Smollett? It's exactly Jussie Smollett. Now you could say, ""I'm offended by it,"" but you can also acknowledge that's art. The best part is that Cory Booker and Kamala Harris share a knowing glance, as they have for years. It's the mutual recognition of the totally fraudulent. A faker knows a faker. ""Oh, you're pretending to be someone, you're not? Me too."" 

It's easy to enjoy all this. Imagine if you worked at, say, CNN or MSNBC or NBC News, and you had to pretend that that was an authentic scene that meant something, that was rooted in some observable physical reality that people who went to Ivy league schools somehow are oppressed. Huh. So, you wouldn't want to acknowledge any of that. You would want to point out that rather than ask a single actual question during the confirmation hearings, Cory Booker just slobbered all over the nominee. You wouldn't be able to say any of that. So, you'd have to figure out a way to ignore it and...our media dutifully did.  

You should know that not one of the people you just saw is a poor person. Not one of them is oppressed. Not one of them has anything at all in common with the people they claim to speak for. So, they are to a person every bit as fraudulent as the people on stage, telling you from the peak of the fake meritocracy that they're somehow fighting against the current. Of course, the opposite is true, but you're not allowed to say it, but imagine the reserve of energy it takes as a newsman to pretend, having shown the clips that we just did, that that was anything but horrifying, anything but so fake that the hair on the back of your neck goes up at the fraudulence.  

That's honestly like telling you that, Lia Thomas is it deeply accomplished female swimmer who's winning because she just practiced harder than the other girls. A lot of the Black women who watched that loved it, said one NBC journalist—a person who can't define what a woman is. The problem with all this is easy to make fun of, but the problem is they are praising a sitting United States senator (Remember the Judiciary Committee) for asking zero questions during a confirmation hearing, during which we're choosing the next Supreme Court justice.  

They're saying it is immoral because of the way that she looks, to ask her real questions, to know what we're getting before she takes the seat for life and of course, this was the whole point. It's the Greta Thunberg play. You throw someone up there who represents your views, who can't be questioned because anyone who questions the person is, of course, mean or racist or sexist or whatever. You know, pick your attack, but the person is immune from sincere questions.  

That's foretelling and yet somehow it gets even more nauseating. The Washington Post Editorial Board saw that groveling and decided it didn't go far enough, so they published this headline yesterday, ""Republicans boast they have not pulled a Kavanaugh. In fact, they've treated Jackson worse."" So, if you read The Post piece, and you shouldn't, obviously Jeff Bezos' newspaper is utter garbage. You will find that The Post Editorial Board is aghast that Republicans ask Ketanji Jackson about kiddy porn, about the sentences she handed down, sentences that fell far beneath federal sentencing guidelines. Ketanji Brown's explanation for her low sentences with the guidelines were written before the internet. Now, that people can amass huge amounts of kiddy porn, the guidelines are too strict. That was honestly her explanation. Maybe you agree with that. Maybe you don't. Tell us the legal principle behind that, if you would, judge.  

Yet even if you agree that because the internet makes acquiring kiddy porn easier, we shouldn't be as tough on kiddy porn. Even if you think that's a fair standard, it's certainly fair to ask about it in a  hearing, no? For comparison's sake, and we didn't want to go here, it's just too obvious, but we can't control ourselves. This is how the emotive, weepy Cory Booker treated the last nominee to the Supreme Court, someone whose politics he doesn't agree with. He told us at the time that Brett Kavanaugh was so odious, so morally filthy, so satanic that anyone who could vote for his nomination was guilty of a mortal sin. 

And the fake priestess in the fake clerical collar nods. It's just so funny. If you were to take a survey of the people most likely to give you a moral lecture about your own moral shortcomings, they would be the people whose personal lives could withstand the lightest scrutiny, if you know what we mean. That is a very consistent standard. Anyway, no one has used language like that to describe opponents of Ketanji Jackson, even though she let, to restate, industrial scale pedophiles out of jail with three-month jail sentences. Nor has anyone subjected her to questions about her high school drinking habits. Remember that? Hate to bring it up, but here's what it looked like.  

That's the guy lecturing you about God. And like all phony people, you see a little glimpse of cruelty and meanness beneath. ""Did you have a beer? Answer the question."" And what's funny is that Brett Kavanaugh actually had to answer the question, not that it mattered in the end. It wouldn't matter what he said.  

Ketanji Brown Jackson, meanwhile, still is not explain what the meaning of the word woman is. Are women even real? Turns out that question is now above the pay grade of the U.S. Supreme Court. Maybe we're meant to think of women as an archetype, a pastiche. Maybe they're like T-Bone, the baddest drug lord in Newark. One minute women are here, fully female and authentic filling you in the gritty details of womanhood. The next thing you know, you drop them off at a housing project and they're gone forever.

In retrospect, Joe Biden's first-term policy agenda seems very optimistic, almost comically optimistic. Shortly before his inauguration, Biden announced something he called the Build Back Better agenda. Of course, we mocked it at the time, but looking back, it was in some ways a hopeful document.  

America must have been a very rich country back then. By ""back then"" we mean last year. There weren't a lot of essentials in Biden's agenda. The first three things that any normal nation needs and thinks about obsessively are food, water and energy. That's the standard. In China, for example, every government policy, foreign and domestic, is designed above all to secure adequate reserves of food, water and energy and that makes sense.  

The Build Back Better agenda was the opposite of that. It did not suggest any concern at all about whether Americans might have enough to eat or could afford enough heating fuel to keep from freezing to death over the winter.  agenda was focused on the kind of added extras you get to when you've fixed everything else and then still have trillions left over. Build Back Better promised us something called ""environmental equity,"" whatever that is. It demanded amnesty for millions of illegal aliens because, at the time, the American economy seemed robust enough to share with the entire world. Universal health care for Honduras.  

Biden called for free solar panels for everybody and taxpayer funded pre-K for all American parents and so on and on. Build Back Better was the neoliberal version of flying cars. It was a dreamy Christmas list of luxuries that, for a moment in time, seemed almost within reach. A lot has changed. Nobody's talking about flying cars anymore. Here's Joe Biden from yesterday: 

Food shortages, Biden said, ""they're going to be real."" Once again, in case you missed it, to repeat: food shortages—not in Sudan— in Cincinnati, Reno, Spokane, Norfolk and of course, in our big cities too where not a single person who was born here has any idea what a food shortage is. Our problem has always been having too much food. Now we won't have enough.  

We know that because the president of the United States just told us that on camera. So, what it this going to mean? How do food shortages affect the country? Well, if you're interested, go online and read about it. All of recorded history will answer your question. A food shortage is not like deciding to skip dessert. It's not a diet. It's not voluntary. A food shortage is different. It's scary. Food shortages topple governments. They turn moderates and revolutionaries. A  shortage is a big deal. You don't want one, but now we're getting one just a little over a year into Joe Biden's presidency.  

Think forward. If the traditional calendar holds, we've got 1,032 left of the Joe Biden administration, and you wonder what things will look like by then. We're already speeding toward dystopia, not the White House seems aware of it or to care in any way. Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from this morning, for example, letting you know it's time to stop whining about gas prices because actually, they're not very high.  

Yeah, it's not a big deal. Settle down and there's a reason for it. As Joe Biden explained, you're paying more for gas because we have slapped sanctions on Russia and sanctioning Russia is the right thing to do. So, shut up and feel virtuous as you slowly go broke. Now, for some people, particularly those who don't drive cars, this might seem like an adequate answer, but others in good faith may ask, ""OK, I'm not against sanctions in theory, but since they're clearly not hurting Putin and they clearly are now hurting my family, what is the point of sanctions? Is there a point? Let me know. Make me feel better."" 

The answer is, ""Yes, America. There's a point to sanctions. Sanctions are designed to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine."" We know that because not so long ago, Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, told CNN that, ""the purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,"" and then Jen Psaki, the president's publicist, backed him up. ""Our intention is to have a deterrent effect with sanctions,"" she said. 

Kamala Harris agreed. The difference, she said, the deterrent ""effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one."" So, sanctions work, except they didn't actually work. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. The sanctions failed. So, what's the response? Admit they failed, try something new. No. Joe Biden is pretending that the administration never claimed sanctions would deter Russia from invading Ukraine. Here's the new line.  

What does that even mean? ""Sanctions never deter. Why do you keep saying that?,"" he said. Well, because you kept saying that. Your White House press secretary, your vice president, your secretary of state all said that verbatim, but they're not acknowledging that hoping that our memories have been so damaged by the iPhone, we'll be as forgetful as Joe Biden himself. Now they want us to believe that sanctioning  can force Putin into withdrawing from Ukraine. Is that true? Can Putin be sanctioned into retreat? Well, we certainly hope it's true, sincerely, but there's no evidence that it is true. There's not even really an expectation that it's true. 

Even Joe Biden didn't claim that was going to happen. So, what is the point? We're not sure. That's a topic for another show, but in the meantime, this country, we know this for sure, is being badly hurt by those sanctions. As Reuters recently reported, ""Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertilizer is key to keeping corn, soy, rice and wheat yields high. Growers are scrambling to adjust."" 

Are you following this? Those ingredients are necessary to put food on your table, any price you can afford. If you don't have those ingredients, what do you get? Food shortages, which are a direct result of policy from the White House, a policy whose intended effect is still not clear. What is the point of this? If there's a good point, people will put up with it. Why don't you tell us what that point is? Fertilizer bills are expected to jump around 15% just this year, and they could go higher. Some farmers say they are already seeing fertilizer prices go much higher than that. 

So, sanctions have thrown American agriculture into profound turmoil and will cause again, as the president has told us out loud, food shortages, which are maybe the most destabilizing trend you could ever have in a country—not just to the politics but to the social fabric. It's scary.  

But it's not just sanctions. There are a lot of reasons. It's not just the war in Ukraine. In response to energy and food shortages, the Biden administration is shutting down domestic oil and gas production. That makes food more expensive. It makes everything else more expensive. And as the pressure on American farmers rises and as food becomes scarcer and more expensive in this country, that same administration is allowing the government of China to buy up this country's farmland.  

According to Politico, and this was two years ago, Chinese investors own nearly 200,000 acres of U.S. ag land, valued at least two billion. Now they're doing this, in part, with the help of subsidies paid for by U.S. taxpayers, and Chinese investors are continuing to buy more every single year. Again, food, water, energy. That's what you need for a country. The Chinese understand that. As Rep. Dan Newhouse put it, ""the current trend in the United States is leading us toward the creation of a Chinese-owned agricultural land monopoly."" In our country, the most productive farmland in the world now owned by what we used to call our main global rival and I think we can now say with a realignment in progress is our main global enemy, owned by a country that seeks to displace us and punish us.  

It's insane. Would the Chinese government permit American investors to buy its country's farmland or water resources? That's not even a real question. Of course not. No sane country would do that, and no foreign entity should be allowed to control America's critical natural resources. So, how long till the Chinese start scooping up the Great Lakes, which are our largest reservoirs of fresh water? Food, water, energy. Don't laugh. That's where we're headed, and it could happen much sooner than anyone seems to realize. Fishing companies are paying such high costs, they're running out of business. Here's another Fox multimedia report. 

All part of our food supply now imperiled through a remarkable combination of negligence and terrible decision-making, not just by this administration, by previous administrations, but brought to the point of crisis by Joe Biden and, by the way, it's not just a question of what it costs to fuel a commercial fishing fleet. The oceans themselves are being depleted of fish, entire species by the Chinese government.  

You hear a lot about the environment and saving the planet, by which they mean don't drive an SUV. But the actual planet, its actual resources, its oceans, the most important resource the planet has. It's not about climate. It's about the oceans and increasingly, they're polluted and bereft of fish and China is doing that. We're not and no one saying a word about it. 

  

So, instead of addressing any of these problems, our leaders are responding in the one way they know how. They're throwing more money at the problem and in the process devaluing the U.S. dollar that we're going to desperately need to stay solvent. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, just announced he's about to give his residents another free credit card.  

So, if the hands and the hair and the teeth distracted you and you didn't actually hear anything that Governor Newsom said, what he's saying is tax prices are really high, so we're going to give you a tax refund, whether or not you pay taxes. It's welfare. And that's going to solve the problem. What he doesn't say is that California has the highest gas prices in America because it has the highest gas taxes in America—seven bucks a gallon in Los Angeles—seven bucks.  

He did that. But instead of fixing it, he's making you more dependent, and this is a trend. For the second time in two years, politicians are sending out welfare checks to compensate for economic crises that they caused. So, if you wanted to increase inflation, if you wanted to make the population weak and dependent upon you, this is what you'd probably do. Free bread next.

Joe Biden announced he was running for president again in April of 2019. It was Biden's third or fourth attempt at the office, depending how you count. So, at that moment, most Americans thought they knew who Joe Biden was. After 50 years in office, they were familiar with his face, but it turns out they weren't familiar with his new face.  

Two months later, Biden appeared on stage in Miami for the first Democratic primary debate and he was hard to recognize even for people who had known him. Extensive plastic surgery made him look like a different person, but most jarring was the fact that he did not sound like the old Joe Biden. You probably remembered Biden as blustery and jovial, Irish charm by the bucket load. He was famous for that. And yet, on stage, Biden came off as remote and muted.  

He seemed to be at times afraid to speak for fear of tripping over words or forgetting them. Several times the camera caught him just staring out into the middle distance. He was apparently absorbed in memory. When Biden did manage to focus his attention, he seemed highly annoyed. Whatever the cause, Democratic primary voters were not impressed by his performance. Joe Biden's numbers dropped 10 points overnight. Now, the Biden campaign has never explained what exactly happened to Joe Biden that night in Miami, but whatever it was, it never got fixed. It continues. From that day until now, probably the most authentic feature of  public performances has been his anger. It seems to come over him in waves. 

So you know exactly what that is. You've seen it in people around you, people you love. It has nothing to do with politics. What you just saw is a man who is losing the ability to regulate his emotions. Uncontrollable flashes of anger are common among people who are aging, particularly among men, and they often accompany senility. Losing it is a very frustrating experience and your heart goes out to anyone who is. 

We have deep sympathy for anyone in that position, including Joe Biden, but Biden is the president of the United States, and this is the single most volatile moment in the recent history of our country. Biden is leading the U.S. toward war and so it's fair to assess the effect on the rest of us of his mental and emotional conditions, not simply about age, Biden is 79. Biden is clearly unable to speak with precision and when you're president of the United States and the world hangs on your every word, when your words constitute American policy, when you can change American policy, particularly America's foreign policy, simply by saying so, it is essential that you speak the words you intend to speak, that you not get carried away because you're mad and say something you don't mean that might threaten the long-term interests of this country, threaten the families and the children of the rest of us and our future, but he is. 

That's exactly what he's doing. That's not a partisan attack. It's true. If you doubt that it's true, watch his performance just over the past week. On Thursday, for example, Joe Biden was asked how the United States would respond if the Russian government used chemical weapons in Ukraine. Now that's a hypothetical question. Presidents at the podium often get those. Presidents rarely respond to hypothetical questions for a very simple reason. They don't know the circumstances ahead of time, so there's no reason to risk American prestige or to terrify the rest of the world by saying the wrong thing. So, they don't. Biden had no obligation to answer that question. Very few presidents would have answered it, but Biden did answer it and here's what he said.  

.  

So he's closing his eyes trying to remember what the cue card says. What's our policy? And when he comes out with is if Russia uses chemical weapons, the U.S. will respond in kind. If Russia uses new chemical weapons, the United States will use chemical weapons. 

So, no American president has said anything like that in your lifetime. You grew up assuming the United States would never use chemical weapons because the United States is not a rogue state. In fact, our role globally is to suppress rogue states. They tell us that's what we're doing right now and yet in a flash of pique, because he couldn't remember the correct words, Joe Biden, the president of the United States, reversed 100 years of American security policy in the middle of a war.  

This did not escape the attention of his own national security adviser, who instantly responded by restoring the status quo or attempting to, ""The United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances,"" said Jake Sullivan, flatly contradicting his boss. No one who works for the president wants to do that, but Jake Sullivan had no choice.  

He works for a man who cannot even pronounce his own vice president's name consistently and yet is in charge of the United States at the most delicate moment in our lifetimes, but Biden didn't slow down. He kept going. The next day, his advisers allowed him to fly to Poland to ""rally the international community in support of Ukraine,"" and while in Poland, Biden met with soldiers from the 82nd airborne. They're currently stationed there. As cameras rolled, Joe Biden informed these soldiers that they would soon be sent to Ukraine. 

So the previous president was often criticized, sometimes with justification, for not using words precisely. You're the president, you can't just tweet out anything. That's the case you heard for four years and again, it was often rooted in truth, but the last president never said anything that even approaches the crazed recklessness of what you just heard.  

""You're going to see when you're there."" Where? In Ukraine. So, the 82nd airborne apparently is going to Ukraine. Their commander-in-chief, just told them that. Of course, they had no idea. Neither did their families. Neither did anyone in the United States until Joe Biden said it live on Friday. The White House didn't even know. Fox News reached out to Biden's spokesman after those remarks and no one there, no one in the White House, seemed aware that those remarks have been caught on tape. 

So, how to explain this abrupt change in American foreign policy? ""The president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, and there is no change in that position."" So, for the second time in three days, the administration has to flatly contradict the commander-in-chief and not on a minor question. These are often written off as a gaffe. No, a gaffe is when you mispronounce somebody's name. Telling troops they're going to be sent to Ukraine, pledging the United States is going to use chemical weapons--these are not gaffes. These are something else.  

They're dangerous, that's for sure. So, the best the White House can do is telling us, ""Well, the president, by saying he's sending American troops to Ukraine, is reaffirming our policy of not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine."" Thanks for the clarification. What else could they say? And it got even weirder from there.  

On Saturday, once again completely out of nowhere, with no warning whatsoever and apparently no forethought, Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia. Watch this.  

Doing his Churchill routine, fine. When things aren't going well at home all presidents seek solace abroad, where they're taken much more seriously than they are by their own voters, but he couldn't stop himself. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Joe Biden said of Vladimir Putin. Now, set aside how you feel about Putin. You probably don't like him and for good reason. Our policy, according to the president of the United States, is to take Putin out, to remove him as head of state.  

To be clear, regime change in Russia has never been American policy, and this is hardly the first time we have tangled with Russia. We've had far more threatening circumstances than this one. The United States, you'll recall, waged a proxy war against the Russian government for 11 years in Vietnam. Nearly 60,000 Americans died in that war, and yet no American president mentioned regime change at the Kremlin. Why? Because they were soft on the Russians? No, because Russia has about 6,000 nuclear weapons.  

So, let's say we eliminated the Russian head of state and of course, that country's central government. What would happen to those weapons? Well, let's see. In Iraq, Saddam's weapons stockpiles, all conventional, wound up in the hands of militia that use them to kill Americans. So, Russia has a large and restive population of Islamic extremists. Do we think it's possible that with no one running the country, because of course, we have no chosen successor to Putin, is it possible, if we did that, that one of those 6,000 nuclear weapons might wind up in the hands of some anti-American terror group and be used against our civilian population here? A nuclear weapon! 

Well, that's not just possible, it's likely and that's if we were to succeed in killing Putin. What if we don't kill Putin as apparently is now our policy? The president of the United States just informed the Russian government that he seeks its overthrow. So, you have to ask yourself: Does hearing that make Vladimir Putin more or less likely to use a nuclear weapon against the United States and Western Europe? Hmm. How to trapped animals behave? Well, they lash out with fangs and claws. Desperate people are dangerous people, of course. 

So it would be in the interest of the United States, and that's the only interest that matters from our perspective, to cool the rhetoric a little bit. Or when you employ overheated rhetoric, to do it for a reason, in the service of a clearly articulated goal that helps the United States and not just because you're old and pissed, which is exactly what you just saw—a guy who just lost control of what he was saying because he was too mad.  

It's all pretty obvious. No one in Washington has spent 30 seconds thinking about what would happen if we knocked off Putin or if we talk about knocking off Putin. In fact, our foreign policy establishment spent the weekend congratulating Joe Biden on saying the wrong thing. They compared him to Ronald Reagan. Washington loves regime change. It's what comes after regime change they'd rather not consider and have no track record of pulling off, but for now, they were thrilled.  

Bill Kristol compared Biden's threat to Reagan telling Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall"" because everything in D.C. is cliché based. Rick Wilson agreed, ""Biden did 'tear down this wall' for our era."" Again, the cliches. Dumb people speak and think in cliches because they have no other terms at hand. Former White House correspondent CBS News Mark Knoller said Biden was even better than Ronald Reagan, ""tops Reagan's 1987 'tear down this wall' speech."" 

OK. To its credit, for once, the White House did not run toward the applause they're apparently still unadultered to working there and they immediately try to tell us that Biden hadn't actually meant what he told us on camera. He didn't really mean it. Any statement that begins this way is a lie. ""The president's point…"" OK, we can discern his point, he said it, but the president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change. Right.  

Well, that's of course, not true, but at least it's reassuring to know our policy remains the same. Neocons in D.C., of course, were highly distressed. CIA operative Rodney Faraon, for example, wrote ""This would have been Biden's 'tear down this wall' moment, but for White House staffers watering down his meaning afterward."" A few hours ago, Biden once again stepped in front of the microphone and reaffirmed that the words that had accidentally slipped out of his mouth over the weekend because he was mad and he has no self-control are actually officially U.S. policy.   

""I'm not walking anything back."" So, regime change in Russia is now our policy. That's what the president of the United States just told us, and as he did, he rebuked the people who worked for him, which is fine with us. They spent all week correcting statements that he makes up on the fly and hasn't thought through in any way, purely reactive.  

Hey, Joe Biden, what would be the long-term effect in the United States of what you're doing? No idea. Don't have to think about the future now, when everything is suddenly at stake. There's never been recklessness at this level in the White House and yes, that includes the last president who was often attacked for being reckless. Nothing he said compares to this. Fox's Peter Doocy asked for clarification and response. Joe Biden revealed that he is completely unaware that his staff has been continuously updating American policy all week as he changes it on the fly. Watch Joe Biden: 

What's getting walked back? To be clear, he's not fit to lead, particularly right now. Bernie Sanders scared the hell out of the banks. Democratic Party short-circuited his campaign and installed Joe Biden. Biden seemed kind of passive for a lot of voters. That was a welcome respite from the last president, who seemed kind of loud.  

That's what actually happened. No one anticipated at that moment that we would be on the cusp of a war with a nuclear armed power in less than two years, but that's exactly where we are now and under those circumstances, to have someone who was literally no idea what's going on doesn't even know that he's changing longstanding policies that adults have thought through when he does it. Does scary describe that? No, it's worse.  

So, Biden just said everything that he has said for the last week is true and none of it has been corrected by people who work for him. The truth is, Joe Biden has no idea. Joe Biden has no idea what his publicists say when he goes to sleep, that midway through his answer, Biden starts walking back his own comments. He does that just minutes after saying he would never walk back his own comments. ""None of that occurred,"" Biden said. Look, it feels almost like we're being mean to the guy by quoting him, and no one wants that. No one is making fun of his age or his diminished condition, only trying to defend the country. Then moments later, Biden declared that no reasonable person would think he wants regime change in Russia. 

All right. Joke's over, too much is at stake. If there was ever a time, if there was, in U.S. history, ever a time, to invoke the 25th Amendment, it is now. As Joe Biden himself put it, ""For God's sakes, this man cannot remain in power,"" for all of our sakes.

628	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-media-lying-florida-parental-rights-education-bill	2022-03-29 23:09:00	Tucker Carlson: Democrats and the media are lying about Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on educators discussing gender with children on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

For decades and decades, the Human Rights Campaign has been, by far, the most powerful gay rights lobby in Washington. You may have just heard of them recently, but they've been around for over 40 years, and for most of that time, HRC's central goal, and they said it many times, was winning the right of gay people to get legally married.  

Then, in the summer of 2015, they finally succeeded. They reached their goal. The Supreme Court issued a decision in a case called Obergefell vs. Hodges and overnight, all 50 states were required by law to recognize same-sex marriage. So, for the Human Rights Campaign, this should have been a moment of unbridled celebration, a dream come true, but it wasn't. It was a crisis and if you don't understand why it was a crisis, then you don't live in Washington surrounded by non-profits.  

So, by this point, the Human Rights Campaign had evolved from a scrappy little lobby into a prominent arm of the Democratic Party. It had a huge annual budget and an enormous headquarters building right 17th Street downtown. So, the Human Rights Campaign may have outlived its reason for existing. On the other hand, it couldn't just disappear. There was a party to help, but there was a fundraising problem. Why would you give money to a group whose purpose has become obsolete? That was the dilemma and they're not the first. 

The Women's Christian Temperance Union faced the same problem after prohibition passed in 1919 and you don't hear a lot about the Women's Christian Temperance Union anymore. HRC desperately hoped to avoid that fate and here's the point of this story: Amazingly, through clever rebranding, they did avoid that fate.  

So, in 2014, just before gay marriage became law, HRC's annual budget was about $57 million. That's a lot. But, by 2021 last year, that same budget had expanded to $65 million. In other words, seven years after reaching its stated goal, its reason for existing, the Human Rights Campaign was raising even more money, a lot more money. It's like magic. How did they do that?  

Well, they did it by changing their mission. So, immediately after the Supreme Court's decision on marriage, HRC began aggressively promoting the idea that the so-called transgender community was being gravely oppressed by American society, by you, and needed their help. In other words, all good people needed to send more money to HRC right away to help the transgender community. So, the Human Rights Campaign's 2014 annual report, which we read today, barely mentions the word transgender. There's no reference at all of any kind to the idea that a person can change his sex just by wishing it so. That was during Barack Obama's second term, but even then, that seemed like a pretty farfetched claim, but not anymore. It's at the center of our national conversation and at the center of the Human Rights Campaign. 

Their annual report this year promotes transgenderism on virtually every single page. There's a long write up on the organization's transgender justice initiative and a prominently displayed photograph of Joe  latest admiral, Rachel Levine. So, the rebranding worked terrifically. HRC now raises millions and millions from companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, Raytheon, Morgan Stanley, etc, every power center in the American economy, all of which fully support now the transgender project.  

So, if you're wondering why the moment that same-sex marriage became legal in the United States, at that exact moment, your kids' teachers began to deny the reality of biological sex, now you know why. It was all part of a fundraising campaign from Washington. If you've ever felt you're caught in the middle of somebody else's fundraising campaign, guess what? You are. And as a result of that fundraising campaign, here's what elementary schools look like now.  

So, every emotionally marginal young woman with a nose ring now teaches at your kid's school. ""I teach my elementary school students about gender identity,"" said one on TikTok, of course. So how is a parent supposed to respond to this? We learned this weekend if someone tells an insulting joke about your wife, you're now allowed to smash them in the face and you get an award for it.  

So, what are you allowed to do if some unionized teacher starts talking to your six-year-old about her genitals? Well, nothing is the answer, not one thing. You're not allowed to do anything. You have to sit back and allow that abuse to continue. Then you have to allow the medical establishment to profit from that abuse. On its website, to name one among many examples, St. Louis Children's Hospital now advertises for ""puberty blockers, also called hormone blockers."" These, it explains, can ""help delay unwanted physical changes that don't match someone's gender identity. Delaying these changes can be an important step in a young person's transition."" 

These changes are called biology. It's called puberty, which is naturally occurring. What happens when you stop it? Well, we don't know because there are no studies on it. Probably nothing good. In the short term answer to that, is definitely nothing good. So, this is not medical care. It is ghoulish experimentation on children being abetted by schools and cheered on by the Human Rights Campaign so it can raise more money. 

The attorney general of  correctly calls all of this child abuse because of course, that's what it is, and he's launching an investigation into it and into hospitals that give children puberty blockers. Now, puberty blockers are not even, to be clear, FDA approved for children who suffer from gender dysmorphia. So, why is this being allowed? Well, asking questions about it has outraged the monsters who prescribe life altering drugs to children for profit. The CEO of Children's Hospital in Canada, for example, complained that what the state of Texas has done was an ""ugly assault on the basic dignity of trans youth and an obstacle to gender affirming care."" 

So, you notice what's going on here. Corporations have seized the language of the civil rights movement in order to sell more products. Too bad they didn't figure out this scam earlier. They'd be selling all kinds of products. Thalidomide would probably be on sale your neighborhood pharmacy if they figured this out in the mid 60s, but they now have figured it out.  

So, this is the environment, an environment in which health care corporations are proudly performing ghoulish experiments on the reproductive systems of children, that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis just signed a bill, a defensive bill, really, it's called HB 1557, the Parental Rights in Education bill. No matter what you have heard about this bill, it is a popular measure. Two thirds of Americans support it. In Florida, the majority of Democratic Party primary voters, the most liberal voters in the state of Florida, support this bill—52% to 36%. That's why, as you would expect, HRC and its corporate allies in the media have lied about the bill and what it does. They have to because if they explained it, you'd support it. Here's the governor of Florida yesterday:  

Imagine if you pack your third-grader off to school to learn to read and do math and be prepared to be a citizen in a functioning democracy and while you're at work, that child, that third grader, is being taught by his or her teacher, the one with the nose ring and the emotional problems, that actually you're the wrong gender and you need to transition. How is that not child abuse? If a stranger on the bus or in the park talked to your third-grader about her genitals that would be a crime, but it's not when the emotionally marginal chick with a nose ring does it in the classroom. Well, it is a crime and the bill in Florida specifically bans it. 

The bill bans any classroom instruction on ""gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K through three"" kindergarten through third grade. That covers ages five through nine. In doing this, Florida has moved away from the experiments underway in many other places. In states like California, for example, the state's official policy declares that ""children as early as age two are expressing a different gender identity. It is strongly suggested that teachers privately ask transgender or gender-nonconforming students at the beginning of the school year how they want to be addressed."" 

What it does in effect is cut parents out of their children's childhood and hand parental powers to people who aren't even qualified to teach English or math and they're certainly not qualified to counsel your child to change his or her sex and almost everybody understands that. This is lunacy. The Florida bill stops it and that's why Americans overwhelmingly support Florida's new bill. So, what do you do with the bill that has overwhelming support in a democracy if you and your donors don't like it? Well, of course you have to lie about it and that's exactly what they're doing. They are claiming that this new bill somehow prevents anyone from using the word ""gay"" in school. Watch: 

Just a little tip to our viewers at home wondering how to lie more effectively. As you do, look straight ahead, adjust your coat, look down a little bit like that and say, ""a new bill in the Florida Legislature."" Once you establish that tone, it seems like you must be telling the truth. Of course, you've read the bill, you wouldn't be talking about it on TV like some kind of knowledgeable expert, would you? Well, yeah, you would. You might be lying completely.  

Nothing in the bill reflects your description of the bill, but because you have no shame, in fact, you're working for a political party and not your viewers, you'll say anything. So, they're telling you that no one is allowed to use the word ""gay"" in the state of Florida because of this law.  

""In Oregon, we say 'gay',"" said Gov. Kate Brown, who announced she's horrified and outraged by this. Meanwhile, Oregon falls apart. Walk through downtown Portland recently and ask yourself, is using the word ""gay"" the most important problem in the state of Oregon right now? Probably not, but at the Oscars the other night, actress joined together to scream ""gay"" repeatedly to remind us that yes, it's the most important issue. 

Such robots and then they cut to people in the crowd are so proud of being gay, they hide it. What's the best part? Celebrating gay rights but pretending not to be gay. Right, love it, and they're saying this to a country on the brink of war that is growing poorer by the day from inflation, but here are your culture leaders, who are so far up their own butts, they're leading chants about silly lifestyle liberalism that no actual person support. ""Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay."" OK, feel empowered?  

Meanwhile, back to the schools, which is the whole reason bills like this have to be passed. On MSNBC, one teacher talks about how he yearns to go into details about his home life with a captive audience of kindergartners. Ron DeSantis, the bigot that he is, is standing in the way of this teacher's self-expression. 

Alright. Less about you and your partner paddleboarding, more about educating the kids. This is not some canvas for you to create your personal expression art. You are paid by the state to make people's kids competitive in an economy that is going to need more competitive Americans. So, why don't you stop talking about yourself and do your job? Of course, that's the last thing they want to do. Some of the most powerful corporations in this country, through groups like the HRC, have decided to push this propaganda as hard as they possibly can.  

They don't care what you think because it's not about democracy. It's not about what parents want. Disney, for example, is a major donor to the HRC and has been pretty explicit about this point. ""Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay Bill,' should never have passed and should never been signed into law,"" Disney said in an official statement.  

This is the company you also hand your kids over to. Woohoo, not creepy. ""Our goal, as a company, is for this law to be repealed by the Legislature or struck down in the courts."" So, let's just think about this for a minute. Here you have a law passed in a democratically elected state legislator, signed by a democratically elected governor, supported by the majority of Florida voters, but it must be struck down because the oligarchs at the mouse company don't like it.  

Oh. So, shouldn't you get back to making kids movies propagandizing for China? Shouldn't you get back to wrecking the state of Florida with your pollutants, you environmental criminals? Yeah, well, they've got other business and their main ""goal as a company"" is now to teach kindergartens in Florida that they can, in fact, change their gender just by wishing it so. 

It makes you wonder if kids in Florida can consent to chemical castration with no parental involvement. It that can be true, what exactly can't be consent to once we set that standard? Disney didn't say, but maybe there's another agenda here. Nor did they explain their fixation on the sexuality of children, but it's worth pointing out that four Disney employees were just busted in a major human trafficking sting, including one employee who allegedly sent sexually explicit texts to a detective posing as a 14-year-old. That bust occurred, as you may have guessed by now, in the state of Florida.

When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us.  

""It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,"" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. ""The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated."" 

That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of . They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane.  

""The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious,"" wrote National Review. In other words, there's a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He's irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis.  

In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this? It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential. You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us.  

They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. So now is the moment to ignore the people who've been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage.  

Nobody would call Farage a stooge of , just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He's devoted his life to it. In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country. 

The U.S. has never had a president as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seem prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place. Read this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding. Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.

So, something's going on with Joe Biden. His poll numbers are absolutely tanking, but it seems like elements within the Democratic Party are turning on him. We're not going to pretend we understand exactly what's going on here, but something definitely is.  

Here's this example and you remember this very well. Just for the last election, the New York Post ran a story about the contents of . It was a huge story, but Big Tech censored it immediately. CNN and dozens of other former Intel officials told us that laptop was Russian disinformation.  

So, it turns out when they accuse people of Russian disinformation, they're not always sincere. Of course, they're liars. They'll say whatever they need to say. That was before the election. They needed to get Biden elected. They did it, but now they're telling you something very different. Now they're telling you, in fact, the laptop is real. 

Here's CNN yesterday.  

What a freak show that channel is. Good luck to their new subscription service, but now they're telling you, ""Yeah, it's all true, actually,"" and that's not the only story about Russian disinformation that has fallen apart this week. The Federal Election Commission just fined the DNC and Hillary Clinton, her campaign, more than $100,000. The FEC determined that the Clinton campaign tried to hide its role in funding the Steele dossier. The Steele dossier is the false document that claimed, among many other things, that Putin got Trump elected. Turns out, the disinformation was, in fact, paid for by the campaign. It was coming from the DNC.

631	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-democrats-benefitting-biden-energy-crisis	2022-04-01 23:00:00	Tucker Carlson: Democrats are the ones benefitting from Biden's energy crisis | Fox News	"Fox News host provides insight on U.S. energy policies as gas prices rise on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Pretty much everybody in America feels awful about what is happening right now to average Ukrainians. They didn't ask for this war and they're really suffering so your heart goes out. You feel compassion for tragedy no matter where it is, whether it's a landslide in Sri Lanka or a war in .  

So, you feel compassionate. On the other hand, you may have, at some point over the last month, asked yourself: ""Why is the invasion of a faraway eastern European country suddenly the single biggest thing that ever happened in our country, in America?"" It's kind of strange, especially given everything we've got going on in the U.S. right now and what is it with Biden's response to this war? That's weird, too.  

Biden keeps telling us these energy sanctions are going to crush Putin, but they haven't. That's clearly not true. Putin's fine. The ruble has almost completely recovered since the day Russia invaded. So much for destroying the Russian economy and getting the Russian military to withdraw from Ukraine and yet we in the U.S. are paying higher and higher gas prices thanks to these sanctions.  

So, Biden is not hurting . Biden is hurting American citizens. Why? What exactly is this about? Well, the first thing you should know and never forget is that nothing changes a society faster than a war, even a war in another country. If you want to reorder a society, you're going to need a major crisis in order to do it. The democratic process is not going to work for you. The democratic process will never get you to total transformation because voters almost never want systemic change. They prefer incremental improvement and that's why they tend to elect the very same people to office year after year.  

They do that because radicalism—big change—scares them. They are not looking —and they are never looking —for massive, abrupt changes to the way they live. So again, if you want a revolution, you're going to need some kind of emergency to justify it.  

Let's say, for example, that you wanted to change a country's 250-year-old system of voting in order to make that system much more vulnerable to mass election fraud, which you would commit. How would you go about doing something like that? You couldn't do it by referendum. No. You might need to declare a public health emergency and then institute vote-by-mail in the name of fighting a pandemic. You should try that because that might work.  

Or, for another example, how would you go about taking full control over an economy built on fossil fuels? Well, you'd first have to break the existing economy because if you gave people a choice over how to power their vehicles, homes and businesses, not many of them would choose windmills. No, they'd go with what they have, which is oil and gas. So, you'd have to take that choice away from them. You couldn't let them choose and you couldn't do this by democratic means because no legislature would ever vote for a change like that because they know voters don't want it.  

So instead, you might use a war underway across the world to declare an energy shortage in your country and then make fossil fuels unaffordable for the average person and that way, people would have no choice but to switch over to the new system, which, not incidentally, you and your friends and your donors would control.  

So that'd be one way, maybe the only way to get a Green New Deal, without having to get it through Congress because it never would go through Congress. Hmm. Do you think that's what's happening here? You'd hate to think so. You wouldn't want to think that your government would intentionally exacerbate the suffering of millions of Ukrainian civilians in order to take over America's energy grid, but that seems to be exactly what is happening right now and we know this because the administration has essentially told us up.  

As of tonight, the vast majority of electricity that we use in this country for everything but 80% of our electricity comes from just three sources—natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. The Biden administration has pledged to get rid of all three of these things. There will be no more coal plants, Joe Biden said during the campaign.  

John Kerry, our climate czar, agreed. No more coal plants operating in the United States by 2030, he said—no clue in how we're going to power the cities that are totally dependent on coal fired electricity. Here's Joe Biden explaining that electricity for your home, your city, electric cars, all of it pretty darn soon is going to come from heat pumps and solar panels.

Wow. So, we just need to completely change the way that you power your home. We're going to get rid of coal, gas and nuclear energy and you can save on average some more $500 a month. You just have to power your house with solar panels. It's simple. So, where will these solar panels come from? Well, as it happens, they will come from China. We can be certain of that because the Chinese make more than 80% of all the world's solar panels, which is to say, all of them.  

So, we're going to be even more reliant, far more reliant on Chinese manufacturing than we already are. Offend the Chinese and no more electricity. So that's a risk, considering they despise us, but it's going to be worth it, Joe Biden says. We're going to upend the entire U.S. economy and make ourselves completely dependent on a country that seeks to displace us. But you're going to save 500 bucks a month on your energy bill - $500 a month, not a small thing, but it's not actually true. 

Shortly after Biden spoke, in a ritual we're becoming very used to, the White House issued a clarification. It turns out that Biden meant to say—and if he wasn't senile, would have said—that you're going to save $500 a year. So, that's one-twelfth of what he promised if we turn over our electricity production to . So, $500 a year, not a month. So, he was only off by about $5,500 bucks. On the other hand, $500 a year is still something. It's enough to fill your SUV maybe three times. 

Oh, it's just $7.50 a gallon, not a big deal. It's always been this way. Oh no, it hasn't. Pretty soon they'll tell you that, but we just want to say, for the record, that that's not true. In 2018, which is not ancient history, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the state of California, most expensive for the country, was $3.60 per gallon. Now it's double that. How did that happen? Does it have anything to do with the current president's pledge to ""phase out fossil fuels forever?"" 

Gasoline is a fossil fuel. He wants to phase it out. It shouldn't surprise you that it's more expensive. Or could it be Vladimir Putin's fault? Did Putin do it? Here's what PragerU found out when they spoke to people who are actually buying gas. 

That's a pretty interesting response. People know it has something to do with Russia. They've been told it's all Putin's fault. The kind, you know, there's a connection between the sanctions against Russian energy and our own rising gas prices. What they don't understand is it's much deeper than that. They're blaming Russia. So, there's a reason the people pushing this war love this war. It's an all-purpose excuse for the disasters they have made, the disasters that benefit them, but if you take a look at the numbers you see, there's a lot more going on here than just a war in Ukraine, no matter what they tell you.  

In February of 2021, a year after the corona pandemic began and a month after Donald Trump left office, the average price of gas the United States was about $2.50. Since then, the price of gas has continued to rise. By last November, months before the Russian invasion, the per gallon average was $3.39. So, no, the war in Ukraine did not do this. Putin did not do this. Putin didn't, by the way, sanction himself. 

Energy inflation is a direct and intended result of White House policies. The whole point of these policies is to make it impossible for you to use fossil fuels because you can't afford it and then substitute those fossil fuels, which you could afford with new green energy that you have no choice but to use. They're saying that essentially out loud. Here's the Speaker of the House, third in line to the presidency, Nancy Pelosi. She explained that even though we probably could fix this problem by producing more of our own energy in the United States, which we own, which is the root of our prosperity, we're not going to do that because cheap oil would devalue her family's investments in renewable. Sorry, we didn't mean to say that. We mean cheap oil would destroy the planet. 

Did you read that? ""Everything we're doing to save the planet."" Now these are the people who preside over the dirtiest state out of 50—California — who don't go outside except in their own walled gardens, who know nothing about the environment, who couldn't care less about the environment, who are trashing the environment and who were raising your gas prices in the name of the environment, so their families grow rich. 

""We can't stop what we're doing."" She's just saying it, right up there in English, ""We're doing this,"" which they are. So, this is a lady with huge estates all over the country who brags that she has a $30,000 freezer telling you, you're just have to suck it up and be poor for the planet she doesn't care about at all. 

So, who's benefiting from this? China's benefiting from it. We already told you that. That's obvious, but the Biden administration's donors are benefiting from it, too, and one of them is now the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm. Thanks to reporting from the Washington Free Beacon, which we are grateful for, we know that Jennifer Granholm held millions of dollars in stock in so-called green energy companies while she was serving as the secretary of energy.  

So, you hold energy stocks while you're the secretary of energy? Hmm, where's the Justice Department? Jennifer Granholm did not sell these equities, even after she took office. Is that a conflict of interest? Of course, it is. It's criminal, but Jennifer Granholm didn't seem bothered. She knew she would never be charged with anything. The Biden administration isn't bothered, either. This is the whole game. Make your donors rich by saving the planet. Jennifer Granholm is still running the Energy Department. Here she is explaining that her stock portfolio would really benefit if we ""decarbonized the fossil fuel industry.""   

It does kind of answer one enduring mystery. Why would they put someone in as secretary of energy who knows nothing about energy, never been in the energy business, has no idea what the energy grid is, has no clue how your iPhone is charged overnight—none at all—and yet she's the secretary of energy? 

Oh, because it's an investment scam and they're all in on it. Check investments right now in renewable energies since the manmade energy crisis that Joe Biden and his sanctions set off and you'll see it's quite a robust market right now. Who's benefiting from that? Right, people like Jennifer Granholm. She wants to force you to subsidize her investments. That's the medium to long-term strategy and no crisis in the last decade has given them better cover than the invasion of the client state of Ukraine that Jennifer Granholm can't even find on a map. There's a reason they're focused on Ukraine and it's to give you the Green New Deal, whether you want it or not.

It's a good day in America, maybe a rare, good day. We're going to celebrate no matter what. Here's the context for why it's good—censorship. Censorship is essentially the hallmark of neoliberalism. Have you noticed that? Our leaders seem to spend a lot more time trying to control what we say and think than trying to improve our country and that means that anyone who orders the wrong words, even accidentally, gets fired or banned or ostracized or even charged with a crime. We've seen that, too. We don't need to give you more examples of it. They are literally everywhere.  

If you live here, you're deeply familiar with it, but censorship now defines America's public conversation. We spend an awful lot of time complaining about that on the show. We probably don't spend enough time asking, what is this all about? Why are the authorities suddenly so intent on controlling our words? Why are they so afraid of free speech? This is a new thing and the answer is pretty simple. It's an act of self-preservation.  

If voters were allowed to think for themselves, the entire system would teeter and possibly collapse. Sound like an overstatement? OK. Consider the ideas of the people in power used to justify their power and the rule over you. Here are some of their slogans, not one of which you're allowed to disagree with. 

Here they go: ""America is a racist country."" ""White supremacy is our biggest threat."" ""January 6th was a coup."" ""Ukraine is a vitally important ally."" ""Gender is a social construct."" ""Climate change is an existential crisis."" ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" And so on. 

These phrases are so common now that you might not even think about them anymore. You hear  or Pelosi repeat them for the fifth time in a single day and you just start to go numb, but take a break from the numbness, pause and think about it.  

Consider each of these slogans on its merit. Are the words actually true? Do they correspond to reality? Observed reality? No, they don't. None of them do. In fact, they're ridiculous. They're laughable and that would be very obvious to all of us if we were allowed to think about it, but we're not allowed to think about it. Effectively, all rational scrutiny of the regime's claims have been banned with the help of so-called news organizations. Our social media platforms, which once promised to give every American a voice, now function like the North Korean State News Agency. They're organs of propaganda. This crept up on us and it caught a lot of people by surprise, particularly conservatives.  

Conservatives were taught from a very young age to support big business because big business was a bulwark against government overreach and that made sense and it was true for quite a while, but very few imagine what it would look like if big business harnessed monopoly power and then joined that power with government power to strip us of our constitutional rights. 

Again, this happened incrementally, but now it's here. So these aren't really free market companies. They resemble repressive governments. They're too big. They're too powerful for you to do anything about. You can't resist. So, if you want to talk in public in 2022, you have to submit to their censorship. It's depressing. It doesn't seem like there's a solution. That's what America looked like when we woke up this morning, but thankfully and it's very nice to be able to say this on a Monday, things are changing and they appear to be changing fast.  

Elon Musk, who's the head of Tesla and SpaceX, famously a billionaire, just announced he has bought an almost 10% stake in Twitter. That makes him the largest shareholder of Twitter. So why does this matter? Well, because Twitter matters, whether you want it to or not. Twitter is hardly the largest social media platform, but Twitter sets the tone for all news coverage, for all information.  

Twitter is where a professional class goes to learn which opinions are acceptable and which are forbidden and the effect is obvious to everybody. If our public conversation suddenly seems stilted and one-sided, it is because in part Twitter itself is so stilted and so one-sided. Anyone who dares express a heterodox opinion, even if it's true, gets banned. We found that out last week the hard way.  

So, whatever you think or think you think of Elon Musk, he certainly understands that. ""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square,"" he wrote recently, ""failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy."" That is true. Twitter shares surged nearly 30% on the news of Elon Musk's purchase, so for him, it turned out to be a pretty good buy, but it's hard to imagine that Musk bought Twitter shares for the investment. He's already the world's richest man. He does not need the money.  

Could this be the first move in a hostile takeover of Twitter that transforms Twitter into a platform for free speech? Seems that way. Elon Musk is not an Orthodox conservative, but he sees the people in power with devastating clarity. A few months ago, he described wokeness, that is to say, the ideology at the heart of Twitter's business operations, as ""one of the greatest threats to modern civilization."" 

When was the last time you heard a crisper and more precise definition than that? ""Wokeness gives mean people a shield to be mean and cruel, armored in false virtue."" Not a lot of CEOs talk this way, in fact, none. They're not allowed. The fact that a CEO who does talk this way may take over one of the most important communications platforms in the United States is cause for celebration, real celebration.  

Censors are powerful, but it turns out they may not be all powerful. So, what happens next? Let's be very clear, this is not a business transaction. It's much bigger than that. Elon Musk is a massive threat to the way things are. So, by definition, it will not be long before they are calling him a racist. You can mark your calendar, Tonight, there are Democratic operatives studying everything Elon Musk has ever said in public. They're preparing one of the nastiest campaigns of character assassination in memory. They have no choice but to do this. 

Restoring free speech to Twitter is the greatest possible threat to the people in charge. They have to control the information. If they don't, they fall. So, you're going to be hearing a lot about Elon Musk in coming days, and all of it will be negative. At some point, they're going to unearth this clip from the Babylon Bee's podcast back in December. They'll tell you this is some kind of fascist talk or dangerous ethno-nationalism. We'll let you judge for yourself.  

OK, so the first tip that what you just heard is forbidden, is that it's real. He's not talking about something ephemeral. He's not talking about the Academy Awards. He's talking about perpetuating the species, something that has inherent meaning that we ought to be thinking about, but that by design will not. ""Have more children,"" he said. That's one of the things you're no longer allowed to say in public.  

Now, Musk himself has already ignored that order. He's got eight kids. The problem with people with eight kids is they're hard to control. Why? Because they're apt to love their own kids more than the corporation they work for or more than the government they live under. 

So neoliberal leaders hate the idea of big families in the same way they hate the idea of religious faith because both are a challenge to their power. That's one of many reasons they despise Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, whose pro-family policies are the most comprehensive in the world. Because of those policies, we went to see Orbán last summer and here's how he described to us what he's doing in Hungary.  

A world leader who reads books and talks like it. So, he's essentially arguing that Hungary is hated by the leaders of other countries because the contrast is so stark. Hungary is conservative. Let's be clear what we mean by conservative. Hungary is conservative in pretty much exactly the same way the United States was conservative in 1998, not old-fashioned, repressive, conservative, whatever that is, but just sort of normal people conservative--the conservative you remember very well before the lunatics took over.  

So, Hungary has stayed that course thanks to the man you just saw and as a result, it has turned out to be much more successful, by which we mean much more stable and much happier than most of the liberal countries that surround it. That's true and that's why they hate Viktor Orbán so much. He is a living rebuke to their ideas. And yet, and this is our second piece of good news tonight, Viktor Orbán was reelected yesterday for the fourth time in an electoral landslide.  

In his speech, Orbán described the victory as a win for sensible nationalism, which it certainly is, as well as a rebuke to ""the left at home, the international left, the Brussels bureaucrats, the Soros Empire, with all of its money, the international mainstream media and in the end, even the president of Ukraine."" We should tell you all of those forces and people bitterly opposed Viktor Orbán's reelection and you can see why. He does the one thing you're never allowed to do. Orbán says the obvious things out loud. Last summer, for example, he told us that in order to protect families, you first have to secure your national borders. 

""Families, history, tradition, language."" Find five people who are against those things. People who are against those things are people who hate the idea of countries, who would like to eliminate all distinctions between countries because that would make them more powerful, but take three steps back. So you just watched the guy who runs a nation of 10 million people in Central Europe and he's got a slightly different, not a radically different, but a slightly different way of doing things. Why is it so threatening that he's running a country that looks like America in 1998? Why are they so mad about that? Because it's a challenge to their monopoly.  

They're mad at him for the same reason very soon they will be every bit as mad at Elon Musk. He's challenging their monopoly and their monopoly power is the only advantage they have. If there's competition in the marketplace, they lose because their products are terrible. So immediately, you won't be surprised to learn this, our media set out to slander Viktor Orbán. Must stop Orbán in the name of democracy, a guy who just got elected!  

CNN today reported that, ""Viktor Orbán, Hungary's authoritarian leader and key Putin ally, calls Zelenskyy an 'opponent' after winning reelection."" They don't know, none of that's true, by the way, expect the last line, but they don't even explain. It's just prima fascia. He's terrible. He criticized someone you're not allowed to criticize. So, he's a Putin stooge.  

A couple of questions here: No one in Hungary is pro-Russian, by the way. Almost all Hungarian energy comes from Russia. So, probably best not to pick a fight with Russia, which is much bigger than Hungary, much bigger than Hungary, multiples of the size of Hungary, but in what sense is he a Putin stooge?  

Orbán was one of the very first leaders in Europe to denounce the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Oh, that wasn't in the CNN piece. By the way, how is it that an authoritarian just won a landslide in a nationwide election? Why is Viktor Orbán an authoritarian, a proto fascist and not just an unusually popular prime minister elected for the fourth time? So to answer that question, Orbán's critics have to make stuff up.  

EU officials, for example, are reportedly upset that—and this is the greatest ever—that ""Mr. Orbán has used his majority in parliament to rewrite election laws, redraw voting districts and permit mail-in ballots without identity verification."" 

So Orbán, so it turns out if you're authoritarian, you might let people vote by mail and that cannot be allowed in Hungary. He's an authoritarian for doing that. Unbelievable. Now, Jason Stanley, a confirmed non genius, who apparently teaches at Yale University, offered this assessment, which is equally hilarious. Savor this. ""Hungary shows that if you control the education system, the media and the courts, you can rule forever, enriching your family and friends."" 

Really? What's interesting is that media in Hungary are far less controlled by one party than they are in the United States. There's much more diversity of view allowed in Hungary than in the United States, much more. Just count the publications, their partisan affiliation and you will see it's much more diverse in Hungary. So there's not a lot of self-awareness on display ever on the left, particularly not today on the subject of Viktor Orbán.  

A senior correspondent at Vox offered this assessment on Twitter, ""For the whole country to be dumbed down by propaganda, it's crazy. They literally brainwash people in the countryside. They just repeat the state media stock lies. There are only a handful of independent media outlets, and they are hard to find."" 

It's just too great. They're always talking about themselves. Meanwhile, back in the United States, Silicon Valley CEOs openly admit they suppress any speech the Democratic Party doesn't want to hear. Here's, for example, Twitter's new CEO.   

Oh, so that's how it works. So, you show up in our country as an adult, become wildly successful, take over one of the most important institutions in American life, the nexus through which all of our ideas flow, and then you announce without shame that you couldn't care less about our Constitution and you seek to strip us of our constitutional rights and you don't seem embarrassed as you say that. What are we watching here? We're watching someone who has an unassailable monopoly. That's what people with monopolies talk. They don't care what you think because they have a monopoly. Here's the good news and that's why we're celebrating tonight. That monopoly is ending.

633	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-replace-joe-biden	2022-04-06 00:44:00	Tucker Carlson: Democrats have decided to replace Joe Biden, we don't know who with | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to the president's blunders on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It's hard to remember now because history is pretty hazy, but it was just three years ago that Joe Biden was considered too decrepit, too corrupt, too out-of-touch ever to be president. And that wasn't just the view from the right, by the way. They mostly stayed out of it. That's what faithful Democrats were saying. 

In 2019, three separate neoliberal news outlets, the Guardian, the Week and CNN, all published op-eds with the exact same headline: ""Why Joe Biden Shouldn't Run for President."" Other publications made the same point with equal vehemence. ""I really like Joe Biden, but he shouldn't run for president,"" said a columnist for USA Today.  

 '

""Joe Biden is not helping,"" declared Rolling Stone as if the goal was to help. And actually Biden's family agreed with this. This is true. They did not want him to be president, either. Some of Biden's closest relatives assured friends that Biden was running merely to work off the grief from his son's death two years before. It made a kind of sense. He needed to get out on the road and clear his head and a campaign was the way to do that.  

He knew he wasn't going to win. And for months, it seemed all but assured that he wouldn't win. Biden's first debate performance in June was widely written off as a disaster. It seemed pretty obvious he had zero chance of the nomination and then Bernie Sanders started to win primaries. For the second presidential cycle in a row, Sanders proved to be the only Democrat in the field with legitimate grassroots support. Donors saw this and they panicked. The guy who hates billionaires! What's he going to do to Wall Street?  

So, Sanders was unacceptable to the people who fund the Democratic Party, but there was a problem. What were the options? Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke? No. Both had turned out to be lighter than air. Elizabeth Warren, double no. Kamala Harris was horrible on every level. Absolutely nobody liked Kamala Harris and for good reason. So, it turned out to be Joe Biden by default. ""Get out of the Biden signs. We're all in,"" and of course, the media got the message immediately. By the time he was inaugurated, here's what the Press Corps was telling you about Joe Biden. 

These people. Never an original thought among them! ""He's an adult. It's glorious."" Well, half true. Biden is certainly an adult. He'll be 80 this fall, but no one in Washington thinks the Biden presidency is glorious anymore. They think it's a disaster. Polls show that voters strongly agree. Joe Biden is now the most unpopular person in virtually any room he enters. If you doubt it, watch the scene at the White House today. You've never seen anything like it.  

It's the president United States in his own house, shunned. Nobody would talk to him. So Biden wandered off, looking vacant as a crowd formed around a former president, Barack Obama, who was obviously deeply grateful for the attention. And then it got worse. It got much more poignant than that. Biden tried to horn in on the conversation swirling around Obama. Everyone involved in that conversation, including Kamala Harris, who supposedly works for Biden, ignored Biden completely. Biden desperately tried to get Obama's attention. He puts his hand on Obama's shoulder. He even calls him ""Barack"" like they're friends, but Obama blows him off. He acts like Biden is not even there. Ask yourself if you have ever in your life, seen anything sadder than that?  

It's awful. Now it's true that Barack Obama has never liked Joe Biden. For the eight years they worked together, Obama mocked him relentlessly as an old White guy. He did his best to keep Biden at the periphery. That's where he got the Ukraine account fatefully, but even someone as arrogant as Barack Obama can pretend, if he has to pretend, and that's the point of the video. Obama no longer has to pretend. He can tell the world in the clearest possible terms that he has no respect for Joe Biden because at this point, nobody has respect for Joe Biden. Even Biden's most faithful supporters in the Press Corps have turned on him. Watch this. 

Wait a second. Correction! Breaking news. It looks like inflation is real. It's not transitory. It's actually making us poorer. Crime and disorder in the cities are real, too. And guess what? It looks like a totally pointless war with Russia is not as popular as we thought it was. You're not a traitor for not wanting it. All of a sudden, they're admitting all of this. For months, Biden's been telling us that every bad thing you notice around you is, of course, Vladimir Putin's fault and the media have backed him up, but suddenly they aren't backing him up anymore. Ready to be shocked again? A group of liberal toadies demolished the Biden White House's favorite talking point. 

What? Now they tell us. Is your head spinning yet? Yeah, OK, just one more. Here's Sandy Cortez, who has finally turned on Joe Biden. That was just a year and a half ago that Sandy's job was to use all the street cred she earned growing up in the leafy suburbs of Westchester and then heading off to Boston University, to use all of that urban credibility to convince the young people that actually Joe Biden was OK. Yeah, he's old and White, but go ahead and vote for him anyway. He's got Sandy's seal of approval. 

Selling Joe Biden was her job, and of course, she did it. She's always been more, much more, a dutiful party apparatchik than a revolutionary, but not anymore. Sandy Cortez sees change coming. If there's one thing she's good at, it's knowing the prevailing wind, so she's happy to attack Biden.  

Oh, so Sandy's out? That means everyone's out. What's going on here? Well, exactly what it looks like. The Democratic Party and its media wing have decided to jettison Joe Biden. There was never an official order to do this. What you're watching here, as always, is the hive mind at work. Democrats have the same reactions because they have the same instincts, ""Biden is week, we must get rid of him.""

Now, to most people, that sounds harsh and unforgiving, but in the animal kingdom, it's an entirely natural response. It's the first rule of dog packs. For example, if a single dog wavers or lags behind, the other dogs will kill him, even if they're from the same litter. Yes, it's fratricide, but it's nothing personal. It's a matter of group survival and that's exactly how the Democratic Party operates.  

Individuals are irrelevant to the party. The group is all that matters. No one at the DNC actually cares about Joe Biden or ever has, or for that matter, cares about George Floyd or Greta Thunberg or David Hogg or anyone else they tell you is an irreplaceable hero. All people are expendable. What matters is the party and the party matters because in numbers, there is power. And of course, on some level, Joe Biden knows this. He's spent his life in the Democratic Party. He's never worked outside of the Democratic Party, so he understands how this ends. Inevitably, after 50 years, it is his turn to be eliminated. Will he scream for mercy like Beria did or will he take it like a man? That's the only question. 

Biden can't lead, therefore, at some point soon, he won't be allowed to lead. It's that simple and if you doubt it, watch Biden talk sometime. Biden the other day told us that Jill Biden was, in fact, once Barack Obama's vice president. 

You know, it feels mean even to play that, but it's not a unique example. We see examples like that every single day and his fellow Democrats see them too. So, they've decided to replace Joe Biden, period, but how will they do it and who will they replace him with? That's what we don't know.

634	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-republican-lawmakers-red-states-betray-voters	2022-04-07 00:21:00	Tucker Carlson: Republican lawmakers in red states continually betray their voters | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on lawmakers in red states going against their constituents on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

When you think of American states that have fallen right off the ledge into the deep end of vacuous lifestyle liberalism, and we do think of them from time to time, you probably think of Vermont. Vermont's a place that banned fracking, despite the fact it has not a single oil or gas well in the state. Or maybe you think of Massachusetts, where virtually all human pleasure has been banned for decades, if not centuries, and of course, you think of California. California, a place where one city is now paying people to be transgender. All of these are famously liberal places, so you're not surprised. 

But Utah is not a liberal place. When you think of Utah, you imagine big, happy families and an even bigger salty lake and a couple of very good ski mountains. You think conservatism because Utah is conservative. It always has been. It still is. Utah has the highest rate of church attendance in the country. It has one of the lowest crime rates. The birth rate of  families is fully 25% higher than the national average.  

In the last presidential election, Donald Trump took nearly 60% of the vote in Utah. So, Utah is definitely not California and yet some of its most prominent politicians would very much like to change that. If you don't believe it, watch them talk some time. They sound like they're running for city council in Santa Monica. That doesn't make sense. Talk about a misalignment, a highly conservative state with extremely liberal leaders. How did that happen?  

Actually, it's not as unusual as you'd hope it would be. Across the country, some of the most liberal Republicans represent some of the reddest states. Why? Well, maybe it's the result of corporate influence and corrupt party leadership. That's true. Maybe voters in those states don't feel threatened, so they're not paying close attention to who they vote for. Whatever it is, it's very obvious. By contrast, the most energetically conservative governor in the country is not from Alabama, he's from Florida, which to this day is split almost evenly along party lines. 

So, Ron DeSantis has to earn every vote and he does that by representing his constituents. It tells you a lot. Meanwhile, bright red Utah is now led by a cut-rate Gavin Newsom imitator called Spencer Cox. Spencer Cox is a former telecom executive who always seems like he's auditioning for the title of ""America's guiltiest White guy."" He's beyond belief. In one virtual town hall with high school students last year in which Spencer Cox announced his preferred pronouns to a young girl in the audience.  

What a creepy guy! ""My preferred pronouns are he, him, his,"" Cox tells a room full of children. So, we've got that cleared up. Spencer Cox identifies as a male, at least to some limited extent. Now, Cox could have cleared up that mystery a lot more quickly, simply by declaring, ""I'm a man."" Instead, he went full hostage video, ""My preferred pronouns are he, him, his."" Just in case you had any doubt that neoliberal interest groups control Spencer Cox's brain. Now, you know, for certain, because it's never about gender. It's always about obedience.  

Spencer Cox is obedient, if nothing else, but not obedient to his voters. That's the weird thing. What exactly is the market for superfluous pronouns in Utah? Pretty limited, you would think. Most people in Utah don't need to be told yet, somehow, Spencer Cox is their governor. In a piece today, a really good piece, Nate Hochman of National Review reports that the very first document Cox signed as governor of Utah was something called the ""Utah Compact on Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion"" and it's everything you'd imagine and more.  

The document describes racism as, ""more than just an individual character flaw."" No, racism instead is a system that you participated in, Mr. and Mrs. racist, a system that can only be stopped with ""bold anti-racist actions and policies right now."" Whoa, whoa, whoa, you know you're in trouble, Mr. and Mrs. Utah voter. What are these policies? We'll let Spencer Cox explain. Spencer Cox, wearing his little obedience mask during a Zoom interview, explained that he supports excluding White students from an academic scholarship program purely because of their skin color because that's anti-racism. No, it's not racism, it's anti-racism.  

So, here's this moist, little guy sitting alone in his gilded room with a mask on, telling us it's not racist to exclude people from a scholarship based on their race. Does anyone else in Utah believe this? We'd like to meet them. There can't be many of them. Most people in Utah have more sense than that. Racism was when you hurt people based on their skin color, right? Right.  

Most people in Utah, by the way, still believe in biology—also, gravity and photosynthesis. The state of Utah is pro-science and we know this because Utah State Legislature just passed a bill banning men from competing in women's sports because men, it turns out, are not women, but Spencer Cox disagrees. He vetoed that bill. Fortunately, two thirds of the legislature overrode Spencer Cox's veto and finally got the bill passed.  

This has been going on for a long time in the state of Utah. Spencer Cox previously threatened to veto a proposed ban on gender transition surgeries for minors, which once again most people in Utah say they don't want. 

So here you have a perfectly normal state, filled with perfectly happy normal people, somehow run by a low IQ, weakened MSNBC anchor. That doesn't seem fair to the state of Utah, but it's not just Spencer Cox.  

Utah's junior senator Mitt Romney has also decided he's tired of representing the people of Utah. So instead, he's speaking for his neighbors in the state of California, where he lives a lot of the time. Less than a year ago—this is an amazing example. It was just June of 2021—Mitt Romney voted against the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. OK. He thought she wasn't qualified. Now, this week, Mitt Romney announced that he is supporting the same person's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Huh? She was unqualified for a lower court, but a perfect choice for the Supreme Court? How does that work? 

Here's Mitt Romney to explain: 

Oh, so she's now in the mainstream? She wasn't less than a year ago, but now she's fully in the mainstream. So, here's what it took for Mitt Romney to finally support Ketanji Brown Jackson: He learned, in the course of Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that she gave lenient sentences to child pornographers. Mitt Romney apparently didn't know that last year, hence the vote against her. Now that he knows that Ketanji Brown Jackson has disregarded sentencing guidelines to benefit kiddy pornographers, it's a yes from Mitt Romney. That's the junior senator from the state of Utah and as with Spencer Cox, this is not a one-time aberration.  

Reporter Greg Price summarized Mitt Romney's past few weeks this way, ""confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson, voted against repealing TSA mask mandate, didn't show up to vote defunding Biden vaccine mandate, accuses Tulsi Gabbard of treason for opposing the war in Ukraine."" Amazing. So, Tulsi Gabbard has betrayed her country—in uniform, by the way, she's still serving in the U.S. Army—but BLM? BLM, which torched American cities for nearly a year? They're not treasonous, not according to Mitt Romney. 

Oh yeah. ""Mitt Romney took to the streets ""-- probably the greatest line ever uttered on cable news and like all the great lines, nobody laughed. ""Mitt Romney took to the streets""—to watch BLM burn down cities, shoot people and defraud donors to buy $6 million mansions in L.A. Oh, but guess who the traitor is? It's Tulsi Gabbard. That's what Mitt Romney is telling us. And Tulsi Gabbard is a lot worse than Tony Fauci, who funded the production of a virus in China that killed millions of people. Is that treasonous? No, it's not treason. It's not, according to Mitt Romney. 

So, that's what Mitt Romney learned. ""Back from the streets."" So, the concern here, of course, is democracy and that's a word on the lips of every concerned person on television. What about our democracy? Every day you hear that. So, just a quick civics recap. Democracy is a form of government in which elected representatives represent people who elect them. They do what they ask. The people rule.  

So, with that in mind, and given our strong commitment to democracy, you have to wonder where Mitt Romney is coming from. Is he participating in the system called democracy? Because the majority of Republicans, the people who put him in office, would like Tony Fauci to leave his job immediately, but not . He doesn't care at all. Mitt Romney is not alone, of course, neither is Spencer Cox. It turns out a lot of Republicans in red states serially betray their voters, give them the finger day, after day, after day. The question is: How long will Republican voters put up with this?

635	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-media-russia-ukraine-reckless-biden	2022-04-07 23:40:00	Tucker: Media's treatment of Russia-Ukraine war is reckless | Fox News	"Fox News host provides insight on the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Weeks before the Russian military invaded Ukraine, a chilling story began to appear in a number of American media outlets. Unnamed sources in the  administration warned that  was preparing what they called a false flag attack. The point of the attack was to be a pretext for war with Ukraine.  

The suggestion was that Putin would stage a mass killing and then accuse the Ukrainians of doing it. So the Pentagon warned Americans to expect ""very graphic propaganda,"" including footage of ""corpses and actors that would be depicting mourners in images of destroyed locations, as well as military equipment in the hands of Ukraine or the West."" 

It was a pretty complex story, but the media accepted all of it at face value and then repeated it uncritically. One of the very few who dared to ask questions all about where the story came from was an Associated Press reporter called Matt Lee, and for asking that question, the  flack all but accused him of working for Vladimir Putin. So, that's what happens when you ask uncomfortable questions. The media caught on quickly and stopped asking them. 

But for weeks, the administration continued to release more of what it called declassified intelligence about Russia's plans. Officials said that Putin was about to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. Joe Biden himself repeated that story and that's why, Biden told us, we needed to send another $14 billion in tax dollars to the Ukrainian government. Everyone in Washington accepted this at face value and the U.S. government sent the money. But Biden was not telling the truth and weeks later, the administration admitted that.  

According to NBC News, multiple Biden administration officials have confirmed that there is ""no evidence Russia has brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine."" So, that wasn't true, but it wasn't the only lie. NBC described this fiction about chemical weapons as just one of a ""string of examples"" of unverified information the Biden administration claimed was real. So, they weren't just lying to us about what was happening in Ukraine, they were lying to us at scale, but amazingly — and this is the telling point — NBC was not bothered by that. In fact, they celebrated it. NBC described the lies the Biden administration had told as a ""bold and so far successful strategy."" And then NBC sent out one of the many intel agency puppets it employs to let us, the viewers, know we should be grateful the Biden administration is lying to us.  

Oh, it's all very clever. So, the Biden administration used disinformation to manipulate American public opinion, but NBC wants you to know that's OK because it was for a good cause. It was virtuous. So how should we feel about this, a news organization that celebrates lying to the public? Well, on one level, it's bewildering. Reporters exist to tell the truth. That's their entire job. Learning this is like hearing a doctor brag about killing people. It gives you the chills. 

If news organizations are eagerly promoting lies about a war, then what can the rest of us believe? What can we know is true? And honestly, it's hard to know what is true. We can be sure that Russian soldiers have committed atrocities in Ukraine. There are countless pictures of that. Some number of them must be real. But we can also be dead certain the war is not, despite what they tell us, a childish tale of good versus evil. This is Eastern Europe, after all. Everything is a lot more complicated than it looks on American TV.  

According to The New York Times, a recent video, for example, shows Ukrainian soldiers killing captured Russian troops. It happened last week. ""These are not even humans,"" says one Ukrainian soldier on camera. Ukraine's Defense Ministry later boasted about these killings, calling them precise work. So that happened. It's awful. Now, does the fact it's awful justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine? Of course it doesn't. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was wrong, and the results of that invasion have been a tragedy for everyone around the world. But at the same time, since our leaders have insisted on placing this country, the United States, in the middle of that faraway war for reasons they still haven't explained, we American citizens who supposedly run our government have a right to ask where our money is going and what is being done in our name, but that's the last thing anyone who covers the White House plans to do. Instead, here's what they're doing. 

So that was an NBC reporter, and in case you couldn't hear him speak beneath the obedience mask, here it was: ""Why should Putin be allowed to stay in power?"" That's what he said. Now it's hard to believe that anyone could pack that much ignorance into a single question. Let's unpack it for a moment. Where does this reporter imagine that Joe Biden gets the power to decide which world leaders should be ""allowed"" to govern their own countries? Is that a constitutional power that he possesses? If not, where does it come from? And what does this reporter imagine Joe Biden can do about it exactly?  

He may not like Vladimir Putin. Most people don't like Vladimir Putin, but Vladimir Putin has the largest nuclear stockpile in the world. So, let's say, for the sake of argument, that Vladimir Putin doesn't feel like resigning today. What next? Well, the genius from NBC News didn't suggest ""what next."" Over at CBS, meanwhile, they're a lot more specific about ""what next."" Watch this CBS News ""reporter"" demand that the United States go to war with Russia immediately.  

Ever notice it is the very same people who are so personally afraid of a flu virus that they're still wearing their little masks in public — those same people are the same ones who are encouraging other people's kids to go die on a battlefield. So, the question was, why shouldn't these pictures we're seeing on television justify a war with Russia? That's what the reporter asked, and for once, the president's publicist, as you just saw, seemed at a loss for words.  

""You mean a military war?"" she asked. ""Sure,"" says the reporter. Sure? And with that, the bombing begins and some huge number of Americans die. It's that simple. Sure, let's start World War III. This is demented. It's so completely reckless and crazy, so utterly nihilistic that you'd like to think it's just one overheated kid in the White House briefing room failing to get his emotions under control after watching too many particularly upsetting news segments from Ukraine — and they are upsetting, but it's not just one emotionally incontinent reporter in the briefing room. It's everyone in Washington. All of a sudden, they're all like this. They're all ready to push Western civilization off the cliff after watching too much cable news.  

Here's yet another wacko in the press corps suggesting that Putin is in league with unseen White supremacist forces in the United States. So, we have here, ladies and gentlemen, a fifth column in our midst.  

How is it always people like that who go into the news business? Stupid, awkward, the last people you want to have dinner with. It's enough to make you rethink your career choices in middle age — trust us. But what he's saying here is that could it be that Putin controls his own secret White supremacist forces here in the United States and there will be a — searching for a word — insurrection at Putin's command? Is that, in other words, a nexus between Jan. 6 and the war in Ukraine? It's self-discrediting. It's literally lunacy and these are White House reporters. And it's not just reporters covering the White House. Here's an MSNBC anchor telling you if we don't declare war on Russia immediately and risk nuclear annihilation, then something called democracy will end forever.  

The mixture of total self-assurance, utter ignorance and self-righteousness is dangerous. Ukraine is not even in NATO, tough guy — but doesn't matter. ""The world can't stand by,"" says Ali Velshi. That raises the obvious question: So, what should the world do other than be horrified, which is the natural and just reaction? Journalist Aaron Maté asked Ali Velshi for verification. He asks, ""How do you propose the West and NATO act? What are you calling for?"" And Velshi was at least honest enough to say it: ""Direct military involvement."" 

Oh, what would that look like? How many people at MSNBC would die? Well, let's see zero. How many people in America would die? Potentially many thousands, but it's not just Ali Velshi who's talking this way. It's all over cable news, all over cable news, and certainly all over MSNBC. Here's a retired army major called John Spencer calling for American troops to start shooting Russians right away.  

So the misconceptions here are really deep. So, here's a guy who after 25 years of telling us with a straight face, he served in the U.S. Army to ""protect the innocent,"" but no, you didn't, actually. You served in the U.S. Army to protect the United States. That's your job, period, and anybody who told you differently was lying to you. But he's telling us that his wife is currently serving, but he wants war. So, here's a guy itching to send his own wife into battle against nuclear-armed Russia. Let's hope his wife never sees that tape. Let's hope he's never on TV again.  

This is serious. War is the most serious business, obviously, any government conducts or couldn't conduct, so you'd think in a moment like this, we could get some clear thinkers, some calmer heads as we try to chart a path forward through very complicated time, but apparently, we can't have that. Instead, we've got idiot news anchors calling for regime change. ""Kill Putin."" OK, what then? And then in Washington, we've got emotionally unbalanced buffoons like Adam Kinzinger working out his personal problems in public by yelling about ""war with Russia."" Kinzinger has been saying that for weeks. Fox's Hillary Vaughn went up to the Capitol, tracked down Kinzinger, tried to find out exactly what he's talking about. ""Should we shoot down Russian planes or not?"" she asked, and we're glad she did, because here's what Kinzinger said:

These people are children. They don't care about the consequences of what they say. ""Oh yeah, shoot down Russian planes."" Not like that could escalate into Armageddon in about eight minutes or anything. These people are insane. They're totally reckless. It's our future they're gaming with. They should be ashamed of themselves, but they're not ashamed at all. In fact, they're doubling down on their aggression and their moral certainty and in the process, they are deeply influencing the policy of the U.S. government and therefore, once again, this country's future. The most reckless among us fully in charge. On Wednesday, in response to their relentless prodding, Joe Biden once again suggested the United States might soon be in a hot war with nuclear-armed Russia.  

This war might go on for a long time. Well, not surprising. They're getting a lot out of it in Washington. The Ukrainian people are getting absolutely nothing other than exile and death and destruction of their country. But in Washington, many are benefiting. As Joe Biden said, ""If I have to go to war, I'm going with you guys."" Well, actually, no, you won't be, Mr. President, 'cause you'll be 80 this fall. You're not going to lead troops into battle alongside the White House press corps. You're just going to cause others to do that.

636	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-agenda-lgbtq-buttigieg-biden-education	2022-04-08 23:03:00	Tucker: Maybe there is another agenda here | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on sexual education curricula for children on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" We've been assessing the  for more than a year, trying to figure out what the themes are and here's the conclusion we've come to. There is, in fact, a single principle that guides the Biden administration. Here's what it is. Your rights as an American are not, in fact, inalienable. We know this because Joe Biden himself has said it out loud several times.  

He's reminded you that your constitutional protections extend precisely as far as he says they do. Now, the framers famously claimed that a citizen's rights come from God and the government's job is to protect those rights. That was the deal, but the modern Democratic Party, which will not acknowledge God, has inverted that formula. So now politicians loan you your rights, and they can take those rights back at any time, depending on your level of obedience.  

Think of it as dog training on a national scale. So, it's  who gets to decide which drugs you're forced to inject into your body. Joe Biden will determine whether you can have a 4th of July barbecue at your house. Ask Joe Biden, he'll tell you whether you have to repay your student loans from Yale Law School, whether landlords can evict tenants who aren't paying their rent, etc. These are all Joe Biden's decisions now and his decisions alone.  

So, Joe Biden gets to tell you how many rights you have and under what condition and that's another way of saying, 'you don't really have any rights at all'. Think about that. So, if you have no permanent rights as a citizen of the , then needless to say, state and local governments can't have rights either because you elected them. So, you can vote for all the lawmakers you want, but in the end, Joe Biden will determine what the law is. The president's publicist made that point very clear at the briefing yesterday. Watch Jen Psaki denounce the state of Alabama for passing what is, in Alabama, a very popular law that bans the castration of children in the name of gender transitioning. Now, Joe Biden doesn't like that law. Therefore, that law is invalid. Here's her explanation.  

Oh, it's just so great. She's reading it verbatim. So, to be clear, suddenly politicians are not allowed to tell doctors what to do. ""What?"" you ask, ""I've been in this country the last two years."" Nope! Politicians can't tell doctors what to do. Now, that's the new rule. So why did that rule change? Well, because the Constitution of the United States specifically protects chemical castration of minors when it's conducted in the name of something called trans rights. That's a transgender amendment. You knew that. It's a good thing you do know it, because if you were to disagree with it, Joe Biden's Department of Justice may very well send men with guns to arrest you and don't laugh, tempted as you may be, Jen Psaki is dead serious. She wasn't smiling. She was as solemn as an undertaker as she read the talking points written for her by some activist group and it got more solemn. Watch.  

It's so unbelievable. Who wrote that? You got to wonder! Ugh, these people do have brass telling you, ""Really, you should be worried about COVID."" More people died under Biden than under Trump. ""You should worry about the economy. Has it ever been this bad in your lifetime?"" 

But instead, you worry about all this dumb stuff that we don't care about at all, except it's all we talk about."" But here's the medical guidance we just got from Jen Psaki. Slicing off a child's sex organs, preventing a 12-year-old from going through puberty, that's not ghoulish and dangerous and horrifying. No, it's not. It's ""gender affirming health care."" Indeed, it's all we're now calling a best practice. Now, best practice is a term that doesn't actually have a definition, but it does sound sciencey like something a physician might say and in fact, some physicians do say it, but that does not mean that it's true.  

We know it's not true because this question has actually been studied in some detail. In the UK, there is slightly a bit more freedom in the science field. Researchers commissioned by the National Health Service have reviewed all available evidence on puberty blockers and their finding? There is in fact ""very low evidence that puberty blockers help anyone."" Oh, so what are the long-term effects of these powerful drugs in the bodies and minds of children? What we don't know, according to the study, that's ""largely unknown."" But it's not totally unknown, we do have some data and they're not encouraging.  

Another group of researchers in the UK tracked the effect of puberty blockers on young people aged 12 to 15 over a nine-year period longitudinally and they found that after just one year on puberty blockers, children were far more likely to say they wanted to hurt or kill themselves. Oh. Kids on puberty blockers also experienced stunted growth and weaker bones. They had measurably lower IQs. These are not minor side effects, these are tragedies.  

If you cared about children, you would care very much about these results. But the White House doesn't care, at all. ""Why don't they care?"" you wonder. Maybe because none of this is actually about helping transgender kids. They don't care about transgender kids and shame on you for thinking they did. Maybe there's another agenda. What could it be? Well, in New Jersey, a state senator called Holly Schepisi has taken a close look into a company and there are many of these, but she looked at a company called amaze.com. Amaze.com creates gender-affirming sex ed materials for children, little kids. Now, amaze.org, rather, is backed by the abortion industry, but its videos address all kinds of sexual topics. Here's one of their videos on pornography. The video begins by asking: Is it normal to watch porn? Here's their answer.  

""Find out more about porn right here on Amaze."" Well, thanks. I'll send it to the rest of my fifth-grade classmates. That's on YouTube. So, we reached out to amaze.org this afternoon. We want to know who these videos are aimed at. Obviously, small children. They didn't really answer our questions. Instead, they attacked us with maximum self-righteousness, ""Your show's repeated attacks on curricula and resources proven to protect children of all ages is deeply disturbing."" 

Oh, so they're talking to little kids about porn, but we're the creepy ones? Spend some time at amaze.org's website and YouTube channel, and you'll find a lot more cartoons like this and all of them are clearly intended for young children. In one video, there's a simulated image of a child furiously masturbating in front of porn on a computer monitor. Not joking. Look it up. In another cartoon by Amaze kids learn all about oral sex.  

Yeah, you make the decision because you're in fifth grade. It's your decision. Guess who's decision it isn't? Your parents. They have no role in any of this. That's the point. Amaze.org is producing videos like this and flooding schools with them with the full backing of the Democratic Party. So, the key here is not whether you agree or disagree with the message. The key is that parents play no role in the decision. That's the point. Cutting parents out, destroying parental authority, destroying the family. So, in classrooms, Amaze.org isn't even necessary a lot of times. Some teachers do the jobs themselves. We know that, in part, because of the hard work of a Twitter account called ""Libs of TikTok,"" which you ought to follow before it's banned if you want to know what may be happening in your child's school. ""Libs of TikTok"" just unearthed this video. It shows a teacher bragging to her students about her sex life. Little kids! Watch. 

So, underneath all of this, needless to say, and you can't say it enough, is narcissism. It's about me and my identity and my journey. It's not about you or your children teaching me anything, it's about me. Let me talk about me some more. But if you speak, if you say you don't like this, you don't want your kids learning from people with face piercings about porn and oral sex and paganism, you could be prosecuted by Joe Biden's Justice Department.  

So to be clear, this has nothing to do with the Constitution, nothing to do with science. It doesn't even really have a lot to do with sex. Are they creepy? Oh yeah, a lot of them are super, super creepy. Should they be around kids? Absolutely not, but it's not really about trying to groom little kids overall. It's even worse than that. This is an attempt to usurp the most basic of all parental rights because if you're a parent only you get to talk to your kids about sex. Why is that? Because sex, like religion, is something that the state doesn't intrude on.  

Different families have different attitudes about sex and the federal government doesn't get to decide what those attitudes are, you do. You're the parent. It is none of Joe Biden's business. It's not the business of his creepy little publicist what you think about human sexuality or what you tell your kids about human sexuality. Period. It's your prerogative, not theirs. Now, for centuries, this has been very obvious. Strangers who talk to children about sex have by definition committed a sex crime.  

So if you were to show up on a playground and show nude pictures to third graders or videos about masturbation or oral sex, we would arrest you, but Biden wants to change this. Why? Because he wants control over your family and your values and your beliefs. He wants to determine what your kids learn about the deepest and most important issues there are. So it's not about sex. It's about your mind and that's what they want control of. 

So, Pete Buttigieg's husband has made this explicit. Here he is in a documentary financed by Jeff Bezos, of course, forcing kids to pledge allegiance to something called a pride flag.  

So, they're daring you to complain about this. If you don't like this, you're against gay people. Well, most Americans have no problem at all with gay people whatsoever. Most Americans know gay people, in a lot of cases love them. It's not about that. It's about whether you have the right to pass on your values, which may be different from  values, onto your children. Do you have that right? If you don't have that right, you're not really the parent, Joe Biden is. This isn't really a free country at all. ""Affirmation of equal rights for all."" Right, but what about people who don't want their children force-fed other people's opinions about sexuality? Those people don't have rights. Those people get a DOJ investigation. Here's Pete Buttigieg to explain.  

  

Man, these people have brass. That's the guy in charge of our transportation system. Try to fly from Tampa to Denver tomorrow. See how much it costs you. What are the odds your plane lands on time? That's the guy in charge of our transportation, but there he is on ""The View,"" calling you a criminal because you may not have fully digested his very specific views, about sexual values. ""They don't have a plan for inflation or gas prices."" They always accuse you of doing exactly what they're doing.

637	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-future-china-shiver	2022-04-11 23:01:00	Tucker: If we want to know what the future looks like, you can look at China and shiver | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on COVID restrictions on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The first mass quarantine in human history began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. That was back in the beginning of 2020. Within days, pictures and videos of what was happening there began to appear on English language social media, and at the time, the images were shocking to everyone in the West.   

The Communist Party of China had effectively imprisoned 11 million people simultaneously. The citizens of Wuhan were confined by government order to their apartment and those who tried to leave sometimes found themselves welded inside, some of them starved to death. Authorities in hazmat suits dragged screaming citizens into vans and then drove them to internment camps. Watching this, you could barely believe it.  seemed to have gone insane, moving from authoritarian to dystopian in a single day.  

So this was the world's introduction to , a virus we later learned the Chinese government itself helped create. Looking back, it all seems like a bad dream. COVID panic has now ended, the virus no longer constitutes a public health crisis in this or any other country, and it's clear in retrospect that government lockdowns, whatever their motives, in the end hurt far more people than COVID itself did. The much-touted vaccines, meanwhile, provided nowhere near the protection the drug companies had promised and at the same time came with significant risks that even now have not been openly discussed. So, at this point, knowing all this as everybody does, countries all over the world are lifting their coronavirus restrictions.   

Next will come the apologies and then in the free countries at least, lawsuits and criminal charges against the people who did this. So, we're just beginning to reckon with the nightmare that all of us have lived through, and it's impossible to imagine living through it again. But in China, they are living through it again. The government of China has just completely shut down the city of Shanghai. Shanghai is the biggest city in the country. It's one of the largest cities in the world. More than 25 million people live in Shanghai and the lockdown there is, by all accounts, more brutal and more far-reaching than anything we saw in Wuhan two years ago. Watch. 

Well, if you think Wuhan 2020 was bad, welcome to Shanghai 2022. This has been like no other lockdown, and it's in the country's cosmopolitan and most affluent financial hub of all places. So, this door behind me, this is my exit to the outside alleyway and late last night, I heard them taping up my door along with the doors of my neighbors. They're placing a paper seal so as to keep it closed. Some buildings with positive cases inside, well they're locked shut from the outside. They're using bicycle locks and padlocks just to keep people in.  

So for one, CNN is not exaggerating. You have 25 million people locked inside their homes. You have the largest prison camp in human history. Anyone who tests positive for COVID is shoved into a van and then taken to a quarantine camp. Watch it happen to this child.  

So where are those vans going? Well, here are pictures of a quarantine camp in China. The child you just saw may be there now. Many thousands of Chinese citizens are. At this camp, mattresses are strewn on the floor of cells. There's no water. There's just one shared toilet. Just days ago, the inmates you see here were living ordinary lives in their own homes. Now they're in prison. What happened to the lives they left behind? What happened to the dogs and cats they left at home? Well, chances are Chinese police beat those dogs and cats to death on the street. That's happening tonight all over Shanghai, a mass slaughter of pets, and we hesitate even to show this to you. It's too horrible, but it's also real, and we thought you should know.  

The COVID prevention worker was caught on camera bashing to death a pet corgi. Apparently, this happened after the pet's owner had tested reportedly positive for COVID-19 and taken away to a quarantine center. It was a resident in the compound who filmed this video and filmed how this health worker used a shovel to strike the corgi three times before the pet dog died on the scene.  

A corgi beaten to death with a shovel. In China, that's COVID protection. The Chinese government has also confiscated some huge, but unknown number of house cats from people's homes, throwing them in bags and left them on sidewalks to be killed.  

Again, it's - it was a tough judgment call whether or not to put that on the air, but it's real, and you should know exactly what the authorities are talking about when they say the Chinese government is responding to COVID. There are videos like that one all over social media. So, the Chinese government isn't denying this is real, and it's not apologizing. Liang Wannian is a spokesman for China's National Health Commission. Effectively, he is China's Tony Fauci.  

He recently gave an interview to the state, excuse me, the state run newspaper, the People's Daily, and explained the government's thinking here. ""China adheres to COVID zero,"" he said. ""China's socialist system has a strong ability to organize and mobilize, which will help it ensure the success of the COVID zero strategy."" So, the Chinese government certainly has the capacity to mobilize, but what does success look like? Well, this is what success is in Shanghai tonight. This is video, shot by a resident of one of Shanghai's countless apartment towers. What you're hearing in this video are the screams of the people trapped inside.  

Has there ever been a clearer picture of what hell is like? 25 million people imprisoned in concrete apartment blocks, screaming for help and slowly starving. In the words of a Western journalist called Jaap Grolleman who is apparently stuck in Shanghai, ""This is the biggest, richest, most international city in China and people are starving without medicine, without freedom. Parents are separated from their children. The military is on the streets, and Shanghai's optimism has ground to a halt."" But it's worse than that. Some in Shanghai are so desperate they are crying out for food. Watch.  

And people are complaining that stores have run out of food, and it's nearly impossible to schedule deliveries because couriers can't keep up with the demand. One man in Shanghai documenting the shortages on Twitter, says, ""We had three deliveries that were booked to deliver today. All three were canceled."" 

On social media, videos not verified by NBC News described as protests by people desperate to get food and medicine, store shelves cleared out. This man on the street yelling, ""What am I supposed to buy? What am I supposed to eat?"" In some areas, drones telling people to stay home. ""Control your soul's desire for freedom,"" it says.  

And in this video, the residents yell at the police. At one point they say, ""We are starving.""  

""We are starving,"" they scream at stony-faced police as drones overhead tell them to stop longing for freedom. This is again the richest city in China and you never thought you'd see anything like this. So the question is: What is going on here? Obviously, it's not about COVID. Let's stop pretending. Shanghai does not have a COVID crisis. Even if Shanghai did have a COVID crisis, we know perfectly well from recent experience this is not the way to handle a COVID crisis. 

So, from the perspective of China's central government, the problem is not COVID. The problem is Shanghai itself. Shanghai is probably the freest place in China. It's certainly got more foreign nationals than any city in China. They're drawn by the trade that revolves around its historic port. So, by Chinese standards, Shanghai is an independent-minded city, and that's the problem. For authoritarians, independent mindedness is the main threat. If you're the head of the Communist Party of China and you're trying to run a highly volatile country of 1.4 billion people from Beijing, naturally your top concern always will be Shanghai.  

Shanghai is the one place a meaningful insurrection might start, and that's especially true this year. Xi Jinping, the Chinese autocrat, is set to take a third consecutive term beginning in the fall. Now that was not supposed to happen. There were term limits in China, but four years ago the Chinese Communist Party did away with those term limits and Xi Jinping can now rule the country forever.  

Even in China, that is a controversial move. As a China expert called Natasha Kassam put it,  From Beijing's perspective, there is no higher priority than stability ahead of the party Congress this fall. This is the closest you might come to seeing a campaign season in China."" Oh, there it is, right there. A campaign season, even in an authoritarian country, public opinion still matters. A campaign season is still real, even if you're president for life. Sound familiar?  

So China's rulers want to stay in power forever and in order to do that, they're using COVID restrictions. They're pretty sure COVID restrictions work. They watched our last presidential election closely. Now, how should we respond to this? If you believe in democracy, this is repugnant. Twenty-five million people just lost their most basic human rights. So, the question is, is anyone in the Biden administration, which is constantly lecturing us about democracy and human rights, said anything about this? Has the State Department issued an angry denunciation of Xi Jinping? Is the U.S. government threatening sanctions against China for building the world's largest prison camp? Well, of course not. Effectively, our leaders are defending what China is doing. Here's Tony Fauci admitting on camera he will never criticize the Chinese government.  

We spoke to one of the W.H.O. investigators who've been to Wuhan to investigate how the virus started, and they were prevented from seeing key details and from speaking to key people. Why do you think the Chinese government did that?  

You know, I don't want to create any or mention any... disparaging remarks about that, but the Chinese are very closed in a way of being very reluctant, particularly when you have a disease that evolves in their country, they become extremely secretive, even though there's no reason to be secretive. I think they were very concerned and maybe embarrassed that the virus evolved from their country, but there's nothing wrong with that.  

Yeah. So, they lied about an international pandemic that they clearly had a hand in creating, but according to Tony Fauci, there was ""nothing wrong"" with the Chinese government lying about COVID. There's certainly nothing wrong with starving the population of Shanghai. You would have said so if there were. In fact, Shanghai may be a model.  

A long time Harvard epidemiologist called Eric Feigel-Ding just wrote an op-ed explaining that we should all be grateful for the atrocities the Chinese government is committing in Shanghai tonight because they're in ""everyone's interest."" A health security expert called Nicholas Thomas just told CNN that Shanghai is an inspiration to the world's leaders. ""The legacy of Shanghai will see a return to mass lockdowns for larger cities in the near to medium term."" 

And if you watch carefully, you can see all of this taking shape, and why wouldn't it be taking shape in this country? We've got midterm elections coming and the ruling party is predicted to be in tough shape. So they're doing something about it. In the city of Philadelphia, authorities just announced the return of an indoor mask mandate. Is there science to justify this? Philadelphia has a seven-day average of two COVID deaths. Two COVID deaths in a city of 1.5 million people over a week. Now, of course, when your strategy is ""COVID zero"" two dead from COVID is more than enough to justify another mass quarantine.  

According to a report tonight, the Biden administration plans to bring back its lunatic vaxx mandate for federal employees and of course, the mask mandate remains in effect for all commercial air travel in this country, though not for Nancy Pelosi's private plane, despite no scientific evidence at all that it works, but you must obey anyway and they're making sure.  

At Love Field in Dallas, two robots known as ""Security Control Observation Towers,""— SCOT for short — scan the crowd to make sure that everyone is in compliance. Now with facial recognition software, the robots could know exactly who the disobedient are. We're just beginning to see the outlines of the repression that COVID has made possible. That's the point and if we want to know what the future looks like, you can look at China and shiver. In the state of California, the state is starting to pull funding from any school that won't comply with the new mandate, a vaccine mandate for children. Joe Biden endorses that. Inject your children with a drug with no actual benefits, or no education for your family.

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Has there been—look back—a single 24-hour period since Joe Biden became the president when you haven't been horrified by something you saw on the news? Probably not. The cascade of absurdities has been relentless.  

It's like nothing any American has ever seen and today we're sad to say it was especially depressing. Inflation hit another record high and that's according to the crooked government statistics our leaders have devised to hide inflation, but it turns out there's no hiding the price of meat and gas. The value of the dollar has dropped off a cliff, even as the value of the Russian ruble is rising. So, ponder that for a moment and chuckle bitterly to yourself.  

And then, in New York City this morning, 16 people were shot on the subway in Brooklyn by some lunatic wearing a hoodie and yet somehow none of the many surveillance cameras in the subway station happened to be working at the time, so the guy got away. We do know he was not a White supremacist, so we are betting the media are not going to dwell on this. There's nothing to gain from covering this particular atrocity, just another mass shooting in a big city. It's also sad, but mayhem and economic decline are not for once what we are opening the show with tonight. No, we have genuinely good news. 

And here it is. It looks possible that Elon Musk will seize control of Twitter and end censorship on that platform. Now, why should you care about that? It's like a tech story, right? Who cares about social media? Here's why you should care: because if that were to happen, we could see a return of free speech to the United States and nothing should give you more hope than that possibility. A free Twitter would mean an open debate about ideas on the single most important incubator of elite opinion in the world. It would mean a return to free and fair elections in the United States, a system in which both sides are allowed to make their case to the public and then the public can decide. It's called democracy. And above all, a free Twitter would mean a direct challenge to the people in charge of our country's institutions, many of whom are incompetent.  

For the first time in years, we'll be able to talk honestly about our leaders. We will be able to have the kind of conversations that make democracy possible. We can't have those conversations now and there's a reason for it. The point of censorship is never to shield the weak, no matter what Barack Obama may tell you. The point of censorship, always and everywhere, is to protect entrenched power. 

That's why it's the powerful who impose censorship for their own benefit and that's exactly why illegitimate regimes fight so hard to control information through censorship. That's their main concern. Why are they so focused on that? That's why. Somehow, the right does not seem to understand this; the left definitely understands it. Watch this MSNBC anchor appear to realize in real time what it would mean if the Democratic Party's donor base ever lost control of an influential social media platform.  

And the bigger question on everyone's mind now: Will Musk's newfound Twitter power mean Trump will be back on the platform? And on that possibly nightmare inducing note, I wish you a good night.  

""It would be a nightmare,"" she tells us, if a democratically-elected president were allowed to speak in public, and in some ways she's right. Shattering its monopoly on speech could break the Democratic Party, even an MSNBC anchor understands that. Why are they so determined to keep you from talking? Because they know your talking is the threat to their power. Allowing the free exchange of ideas in America's public square is far more important than any single election result and if you don't believe it, consider what we've just seen over the past two years.  

You can elect Donald Trump if you want. Go ahead and do it, but the Democratic Party can still silence Donald Trump at will. So, what does that tell you? Who's more powerful: voters, or the social media companies that control what voters know? It's not even close. Republicans in Congress pretend not to understand this, maybe they really are that stupid. Possible. It doesn't matter because either way, they will never fix it, ever. They've had a chance. They passed.  

Even Jack Dorsey, who created Twitter, could not end censorship on Twitter and so in the end, Jack Dorsey fled his own company when it became a Frankenstein monster that made America more hierarchical rather than less. A company that serves the powerful at the expense of everyone else. That was the opposite of the intended effect. So, ghe just left. He had no choice. Elon Musk, virtually alone in the entire technology industry, appears to understand what exactly is happening here. Here's Musk in 2018, appearing on ""60 Minutes,"" acknowledging that in a world of corporate media, Twitter can act as an equalizer. Watch.  

You tweet a lot.  

I use my tweets to express myself. Some people use their hair, I use Twitter.  

Well, but you use your tweeting to kind of get back at critics.  

Rarely.  

You kind of have little wars with the press.  

Twitter is a war zone. If somebody is going to jump in the war zone, it's like, OK, you're in the arena. Let's go.  

OK, who does that sound like?  

I don't know. Who does it sound like?  

It sounds like a guy who lives at the White House.  

Oh, that guy, yeah, sure. He's very good at Twitter. 

""Twitter is a war zone."" Now that tape is from three and a half years ago. Twitter is no longer a war zone. There's only one army on the field. Donald Trump has been banned for Twitter, despite the fact he may run in the next presidential race. He's an active politician with millions of people who would support him. He's been banned. Charlie Kirk had a huge following on Twitter. He's been suspended, too, so is the Babylon Bee and for that matter, this show has been suspended. Questioning a prevailing storyline is the crime. Do that and you're gone. It doesn't matter if you're factually right. We were factually right. It doesn't matter. Challenge power and you are censored instantly.  

Now, it's hard to believe that the world's richest man is the only person who could fix this. You'd like to think our democratic systems could fix it, but clearly they can't. So, Elon Musk seems to be our last hope and tonight there are signs that Elon Musk plans to do something big with Twitter, buying 9% of the company was clearly more than an investment. He doesn't need the money. Last week, after Musk became Twitter's single biggest shareholder, Twitter's management announced that he would join their board of directors.  

The seat would come with two major restrictions. First, Musk would be barred from owning more than 15% of Twitter stock. He would not be allowed to control the company. Second, as a board member, Elon Musk would have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, and in real terms, that means he could not reveal Twitter's algorithms. He couldn't tell the public what they are, but those algorithms are used to censor and suppress effective critics of the Biden administration, very often without their knowledge. It's done in secret. You can't fight back. You don't even know what's happening.  

So he could not challenge that if he took a board seat. But this weekend, Musk abruptly pulled out of the deal, and that means he's free to buy more shares of Twitter, in fact to control it. On Sunday night, Twitter's pro censorship CEO, Parag Agrawal told Twitter employees to brace for Musk's attempt at a hostile takeover. He also strongly implied that Twitter will not submit unless forced, ""There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged."" 

So you have to ask yourself: how exactly would Twitter, which is a public company, fight off a hostile takeover from the richest guy in the world? And already you can see the strategy to keep Elon Musk at bay. First, Twitter is enlisting the help of corporate media. Now corporate media stands to lose at least as much as the Democratic Party will lose if Twitter is liberated. Competition is terrible for the mediocre and the illegitimate. So, MSNBC understands this intuitively, even the airheads who read the scripts on the air, and so they were the first to answer the call. What did they do? You know exactly what they did. They did what they always do. They called Elon Musk a racist. Watch.  

Fear not right-wingers, another bro-fascist, is waiting in the wings to defend your right to spew bile online in the name of free speech, and that is coming up next.  

He is building in Tesla a documentedly racist company that perhaps reminds him, gives him nostalgic memories of apartheid South Africa, where he grew up. He's more than that, an embodiment of what I would say is Twitter's biggest strategic problem, which is a hostile, cruel, dangerous online environment, especially for women, especially for people of color, women of color in particular.  

We can bore you with a rebuttal to the ludicrous explanation you just heard, but it's not necessary. If you have an IQ above room temperature, you laugh at it. That's the lowest brow propaganda possible. It's all MSNBC is capable of. ""He's a racist, ignore him."" But at The Washington Post, they served up something slightly different, a little more stealthy. They enlisted the former CEO of Reddit, an activist mediocrity called Ellen Pao, who couldn't manage to actually run Reddit, to write an op=ed with this title: ""Elon Musk's vision of 'free speech' will be bad for Twitter."" 

And then the piece contained this line. Now, this line doesn't so much reveal a lack of self-awareness, as it does commit murder against the entire concept of trying to support it and here's what it is: ""Musk's appointment to Twitter's board shows that we need regulation of social media platforms to prevent rich people from controlling our channels of communication."" Now, once again, this ran in The Washington Post, a paper that apparently unbeknownst to the editors who work there, is owned by billionaire oligarch Jeff Bezos—China's biggest retailer and used as his personal platform to lobby the federal government and settle scores.  

So, Jeff Bezos can own the only news gathering operation in your nation's capital and use it for business and ideological ends, but the idea of letting average people say what they want on Twitter is a threat to democracy. And if you think that's hilarious, you should read the piece in The Guardian. It was written by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, a little Stalinist, ""Elon Musk's vision for the internet is dangerous nonsense."" The subhead read this way, ""Musk has long advocated for a libertarian vision of an uncontrolled internet. That's also the dream of every dictator, strongman and demagogue."" Right, so what dictators, strongmen and demagogues want is the people over whom they rule to say whatever they want and to challenge their power. That's kind of the way dictatorships work. Isn't that right, Robert Reich?  

The funny thing is, Robert Reich is a lifelong leftist now pushing 80. You can imagine the Robert Reich of, say, 1970, when he was a little college advocate, would be a little bit surprised to see the Robert Reich of nearly 80 calling for a total crackdown on the opinions of ordinary people, but you know, people get power and they change. But that doesn't make any sense as an argument, you can see why they stick to calling Elon Musk a racist on cable news. They just stick to the same old script and that's what they're doing at CNN, of course. Watch.  

I think, in some ways, it's a good thing that Elon is out there tweeting, livening up Twitter, making it more entertaining, as Cora said, he's a funny guy. But there are serious questions behind that. What happens next? Does he push for a full acquisition? We don't know.  

Yeah, and maybe he's just in it for the LOLs, but some of the memes he posts on Twitter - anti-trans memes, anti-COVID vaccine memes, there's a reason to be skeptical, I think, here. 

No anti-COVID memes here. ""He asked questions about the mandatory COVID vaccine. Crush him!"" No one's won over by this, it's absurd. So clearly that propaganda strategy will not win open minds to the side of censorship. In fact, it's impossible to win open minds to the side of censorship because the idea is repugnant to any free spirit.  

So, there's other tools that Twitter is going to have to use to stop a hostile takeover on behalf of free speech. So, for example, it's virtually certain that Twitter is on the phone now with corporate lawyers in New York finding ways to use what's known as a poison pill strategy to minimize Elon Musk's ownership stake as much as it possibly can.  

One option—and this would be really interesting—is to give Twitter shareholders the ability to buy many more shares at a discount to dilute Musk's control over the company, but that strategy is not guaranteed to work. Musk himself has a ton of options aside from buying all the shares he wants. 

For example, he might think of this. Elon Musk could enlist the public - the pro-free speech public - in his hostile takeover of Twitter. So anyone who is against censorship could buy Twitter stock and then pledge his or her proxy votes to Elon Musk and that would give him control of the company and the company would be free. That would also be the single most revolutionary event ever to take place in the history of finance. It'll be pretty thrilling to watch, and it might work. Maybe he’ll try it.

639	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-what-does-frank-james-think	2022-04-13 22:59:00	Tucker: What does Frank James think? | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to the Brooklyn subway shooting on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

So, what should we think of the story? We should say at the outset that not every tragedy has obvious lessons. We are hesitant to draw quick and dirty political conclusions, particularly partisan ones from something bad that happened. Not every mudslide in Sri Lanka or cyclone in Ohio was the result of climate change. Fair, but it's still interesting to know a lot more about the man who apparently committed this crime: Frank James. Who was he? What did he think?  

Well, it turns out that for years, Frank James posted Black supremacist rants on his YouTube channel for all to see. Some of these videos date back to 2013 and continue to very recently. He uploaded within the last few days. Overnight, the journalist Andy Ngo unearthed a number of these posts. You can go find them online. We're not going to show them to you, but we want to read you some excerpts so you have some idea of what this man was thinking.  

In one video he posted to YouTube, James declares that, ""White people and Black people, as we call ourselves, should not have any contact with each other. Blacks and Whites, so-called should not even be in the same hemisphere."" 

James seemed especially enraged that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden's Supreme Court pick, had married a White man: ""I had no idea that she would be married to a White man. Yeah, our Black sister Supreme Court justice, power to the people, is married to an F-ing White man."" 

In other posts, James called for violence against people on the basis of their skin color. In one video, James says, for example, that ""the White MFers that I want to kill, you know, I really want to kill them because they're White."" Pretty direct about his feelings on that. On Facebook, he posted a meme that said, ""Oh Black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys."" Why was he so angry? Well, James explained that himself, ""the vast majority of people, White MFers, are racist."" He'd seen that on CNN and he believed it. 

There were signs long before the shooting yesterday that James was dangerous and he might act out against other people. In one instance, James filmed himself shouting racial epithets at people on the street, ""F u and your White a-- too you, MFer. I had to throw that in for good luck. I don't listen, yeah, White, racist MFer. They do exist. They do F-ing exist."" We could go on and on and on. He attacks Asians, too. Disgusting.  

So this guy was a racist. He was not a White supremacist. And that might surprise you because Joe Biden and some of the shills who work for him, including the attorney general and the head of DHS, have told us again and again and again—and the New York Times has confirmed this again and again and again— that White supremacists, right-wing Trump voters are the number one terror threat in the United States of America. Here's Biden.  

We must confront and defeat political extremism, White supremacy and domestic terrorism.  

White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat.  

According to United States Intelligence Community, domestic terrorism from White supremacists is the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland. 

What a liar he is. Yeah, there are racists of all colors in this country, but White supremacy is not the main threat we face. Racial animus of all kinds is not the main threat we face and in fact, since Joe Biden took office, there has not been a single, deadly attack by a White supremacist or QAnon shaman.  

At the same time, since Joe Biden took office, a BLM supporter rammed his car into a barricade at the Capitol and murdered a police officer. Then another BLM supporter ran over dozens of people, including children, at a Christmas parade in Wisconsin, Waukesha, killing six people. Many more remain.  

Most recently, a BLM supporter—and by the way, an honoree of the Barack Obama Foundation—tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate in Kentucky. Again, most people who commit acts of violence like this are mentally ill. So, there isn't always an obvious political lesson, but if you take three steps back, maybe if the entire news media tells you every day of your life that America hates you because of your skin color, you might respond to that at a certain point.  

Why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't we see more crimes like this? They're being abetted and effectively encouraged by the Biden administration and the American news media, obviously, and it's bad for everybody, of all colors. Sowing race hatred, suspicion, anxiety is terrible for the country, and they're doing it every single day.

640	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-elon-musk-challenging-censorship	2022-04-14 22:15:00	Tucker: Elon Musk is challenging censorship | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Elon Musk became famous as a businessman. He makes electric cars and rockets and has become the single richest person on planet Earth by doing that.  

Elon Musk is not from the United States. He grew up in South Africa, and yet he has a keen and precise understanding of how our system was designed to work. As he put it on Twitter last month, ""free speech is essential to a functioning democracy."" 

And then Musk asked his 80 million followers on Twitter a very simple question: ""Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to that principle?"" and overwhelmingly they answered, ""No, it doesn't."" So, Elon Musk understands something about Twitter that many people in our country don't understand, which is it is the single most important forum for speech, possibly in the world. Not because it's the biggest, but because it's where elite opinion is incubated and so free speech on Twitter matters.  

And last month, Elon Musk gave the impression that he planned to do something about it, that he planned to open up Twitter. He bought 10% of the company. Now, today, Musk has just put in an offer to buy 100% of Twitter at $54 a share and take the company private. Now, from a business perspective, this is a very tempting offer for the company. In fact, his offer represents a 54% premium over the company's share price the day before he began investing in it. 

He wrote a letter to Twitter's board last night. ""Twitter has extraordinary potential,"" he wrote. ""I will unlock it."" So, this is more than a business plan. In fact, it's not an overstatement to say it could be the single most important development for free speech in the modern history of the United States. As Musk put it, Twitter's potential is to be ""the platform for free speech around the globe."" Twitter will ""neither thrive nor serve the societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" 

Musk then made it clear that he has no confidence whatsoever in the people who currently run Twitter, including its pro censorship CEO: ""If this deal doesn't work, given that I have no confidence in management, nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.""  

That means if Twitter's board rejects Elon Musk's offer, they will need to explain why to their shareholders. They turn down a deal that would make the shareholders much richer. So, by doing this, Elon Musk is putting everything on the line. He knows how important Twitter is to the people who run our system, who run the global system. For them, censorship and propaganda are not a feature of their rule. Their rule depends on censorship and propaganda. If you are offering policies that really benefit nobody but yourself, you have to lie about them, and you must prevent anyone from complaining about it. 

So censorship and propaganda are at the very heart of neoliberalism and Elon Musk is challenging all of that directly. He's the richest man in the world. He's not trying to make more money. He's not donating to a foreign charity or creating a tax shelter for himself, at least in this case. He's using his money to allow at least potentially Americans to speak freely. Is it distressing that our own democratic system isn't working, that you would need some rich guy to swoop in, deus ex machina, to save free speech in the United States? Of course, it is. Is it sad that we're all desperate for Elon Musk to save us? Yes, it is. But who else is going to save us? Nobody, at this point. So, of course, corporate media, which exist to stifle the views of individual Americans, hates the idea and their first move is to mock it. Watch. 

He says he wants to pay $54.20 a share to buy up the rest of Twitter that he doesn't have. Of course, $54.20. That's 420. That's a code for marijuana, you know, which he very much enjoys. So, is this all a troll or is this very real? 

It's just so bizarre. 

Right, I mean the 420 coding and everything. 

Is it just a troll and maybe he's not going to negotiate? He says, ""this is my best and final, last and final offer. I'm not going to negotiate here."" Is this just some sort of game?  

Is he doing it for the lolz?  

It can't really be real. Well, think it through for a second. By challenging the monopoly on speech - not just in the United States, but globally on Twitter - on this central platform for ideas, Elon Musk is risking everything that he has. His many businesses intersect with governments around the world. They're not for this. They could crush him for even suggesting it. So, he's all in. He has to be all in even to say something like this.  

At Twitter, they know he's all in and that's why they're so upset about it. According to a Bloomberg reporter, even before Musk's offer today of a hostile takeover, ""the vibe among workers at Twitter is 'super stressed' with employees 'working together to help each other get through the week.'"" That's how threatening this is and you have to ask yourself, what kind of company is Twitter? The company's stock just jumped 30%. That happened when Elon Musk first bought in. So obviously this is not a company that exists to make money. This is a company that exists to censor speech. That's its whole purpose.  

The Biden administration certainly understands this and they've already made a move to intimidate Musk into backing off. FOX Business' Charlie Gasparino was reporting tonight that ""as Elon Musk offers to buy the rest of Twitter, a legal source tells FOX Business that the SEC and the DOJ have launched what he described as a 'joint investigation' into a myriad of Musk regulatory issues, primarily involving Tesla."" 

In other words, threatened to allow people to speak freely and will crush your businesses. That's Third World behavior. At The Washington Post, owned by also one of the richest people in the world, Max Boot, very much supports stopping Elon Musk. In fact, Elon Musk, he tells us, must be silenced in the name of democracy, ""I am frightened by the impact on society and politics if Elon Musk acquires Twitter. He seems to believe that on social media, anything goes. For democracy to survive, we need more content moderation, not less."" Really? So, for democracy to survive, the citizens in the democracy need to talk less, need to express their opinions more guardedly, need to shut up? What kind of democracy are we talking about?  

It's not democracy, as the Athenians or the founders of this country understood it. Democracy is a euphemism for letting our mafia run your country for our benefit. A journalism professor called Jeff Jarvis explained today on Twitter that tyranny is when the regime can't censor its own citizens, ""Today on Twitter feels like the last evening in a Berlin nightclub at the twilight of the Weimar Germany."" 

In other words, you're a Nazi if you're for speaking freely on Twitter. CNBC host Joe Kernen understands exactly what's going on. If Twitter is opened up, that means people who are paid to censor the public on Twitter will lose their ability. They'll lose their guardianship of free speech. Watch this.  

Who's that ADL guy, Andrew? This is his worst nightmare. I think Jonathan Greenblatt. It's going to be, I mean, if he owns the whole place, it's going to be like, ""Go for it."" I think it's going to be, and the orange man, probably going to be back and this is unbelievable.  

He's exactly right. Again, you can't overstate what a threat this is - not simply to the people occupying seats of political power, but to the whole nonprofit universe that exists and thrives and becomes rich, supporting them through censorship and propaganda. So, groups like the ADL or Media Matters take money in order to censor people. They issue some report calling you a racist and then social media shuts you down. Elon Musk is saying no people should be able to speak freely. That would mean the end of their control over speech, groups like the ADL and Media Matters. So, the media and these nonprofit groups have to stop this before it happens. Here's MSNBC telling you that Elon Musk must be stopped because he's a bigot. 

He's one of the most thin-skinned people on social media and this week, he tried to come for Senator Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted, ""Let's change the rigged tax code so that the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else."" Well, Elon wasn't happy, so he did what he always did and stomped his little feet and insulted Senator Warren, calling her an angry mom and referring to her as Senator Karen. So, for so many reasons, being a freeloader and a selfish and disrespectful one, and for misappropriating Black vernacular for misogynistic purposes, Elon Musk is the absolute worst.  

So, all of a sudden, the political party that's supported almost exclusively by oligarchs like Jeff Bezos and the Google guys is telling you that it's dangerous for rich people to have too much control over speech. Really? Facebook is controlled by one person, Mark Zuckerberg, but that's not a threat because Mark Zuckerberg is happy to work on behalf of the Democratic Party. Once again, if anything, we are understating what a big deal this move on Twitter by Elon Musk is. If free speech is restored to even one big social media platform, it all comes tumbling down.

641	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-reveals-compelling-new-fox-nation-season-tucker-carlson-originals	2022-04-15 23:08:00	Tucker reveals compelling new Fox Nation season of 'Tucker Carlson Originals' | Fox News	"Senior executive producer Justin Wells discusses Tucker Carlson's series on 'Tucker Carlson Originals.'

Welcome to season two of ""Tucker Carlson Originals."" About a year and a half ago, a group of producers and I sat down at dinner and talked about how to go a little deeper into some of the topics we cover on the nighttime show. Wouldn't it be interesting to spend more than three and a half minutes on a subject that matters to our viewers? Wouldn't it be cool to make documentaries?  

The only problem is cable news companies don't make documentaries. They make cable news and they do a pretty good job, we think. But we went to Fox News and asked, ""Could we do this?"" To our amazement and delight, they said, ""Yes, you can."" And so for the last year, we have made a series of long-form documentaries about issues that we think matter to the country and to you and they've worked better than we ever expected. 

We're proud of what we've created. So we're doing another season and for a preview of that, we are joined by the diabolical genius behind the curtain — the man behind all this — our senior executive producer Justin Wells, who is a vice president here at Fox News. Justin Wells, good to see you on camera for the first time in a long time — since last year. So, this has become something that we, I think it's fair to say, did not expect it to become at all. 

  

We knew we wanted to do it and we knew FOX was supporting us and going out there telling stories that no one's telling. We went to at least 30 states. We went to several countries and we got a lot of support from the audience because they were not able to consume this anywhere else and we, you know, rattled a few people in the mainstream media or whatnot, obviously, because, you know, perhaps some of the stories are controversial, but they're topics that people care about deeply and you actually need to spend time dissecting them and understanding them and that's what we do in these documentaries. They're shot beautifully. You know, we've got the best team as far as that, but the team that does the nightly show knows what stories matter to people. They're part of this and that's why I think it worked. 

And you hate to suck up to your employer. I see people all the time sucking up to their employers. They work for these horrible, big companies, force them to read the propaganda and they do. I resent all of that. But I have to say Fox News has gone all in, in support of this. Some of the stuff that we've produced has not been popular with, like NBC and CNN and you would know since you deal with it, but FOX has stood behind us completely. 

One hundred percent and there hasn't been a single time where they've told us, ""Talk about this, don't talk about that"" or ""go and cover that story or don't cover that story."" We say, ""This is what we're doing this season. We decided to go to Hungary and we're going to really investigate how they took a different approach to George Soros and dive into that and see how maybe we could learn something here in America."" And we did that on our own and, you know, they've given us the resources to go.  

Yeah, they have. 

And you know, the New York Times didn't love that we were there for a week investigating how they take a different approach to their country. We somehow ended up in Serbia by accident on that trip. You know, new surprises along the way. But, you know, I think that's what makes the series different. I think that's why it's resonated with people. That's why we're able to go out for season two, cover even more topics that are equally going to be as insightful as what we did in the first season, but nobody's talked about some of these. Nobody's talked about testosterone levels or... 

No and pushed the boundaries a little bit. It's a little weird to wake up at 52 and realize you work for the last stronghold of free speech in all mass media. I did not expect that when I started working here 13 years ago. I don't think you did either, but that's really where we work—the last place where you can say what you think is true and your bosses will back you up. So, why is this season better?  

Well, I think the season's better. First of all, it's on Fox Nation and you know, if we were doing this on YouTube or some other outlet or whatever, they'd be banning it. We wouldn't be able to view it.  

Ya think? 

Fox Nation, you go there, you can sign up and you're going to get everything from testosterone levels, which you're going to hear later in the hour. Last season, we covered UFOs and that phenomenon and, you know, we dived into cattle mutilations a little bit, but this season we really are investigating that fine tune, you know, approach to what's actually happening. 

Well, yeah, because it's the perfect story for this series, because it's one of those things that you hear about and you think, ""Well, that can't be. That's too crazy to be real."" You ask questions about it - ""shut up, conspiracy monger"" - and then you get a little deeper into it and you ask, like, ""What the hell is this?"" And I think that we did that. 

We did. And there's some guys that are going to be on later this hour that are going to demonstrate why what we're looking is, it can't be, you know, humans just going there and like people do not, you know, take cows and mutilate them randomly on farms there.  

No, at scale.  

Massive scale. Yeah. 

So, Justin Wells, I'm going to wreck your life by saying this, but this is the man behind all these different products, so we thought you should say ""hi"" to him. Again, thank you for that.  

Thank you.

642	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-war-ukraine-distract-crises	2022-04-18 23:53:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden is using the war in Ukraine to distract from crises at home | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on how the U.S. should respond to the Russia-Ukraine war and provides insight on the economy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Knowing what we know about our current leadership class, the one thing we can be absolutely certain of is they always go too far. They always get over their skis. They just can't help themselves. That's who they are.  

In February, when the Russian military invaded Ukraine, there was always out there the chance that the Biden administration would find a way to turn what was a regional tragedy into something bigger, like an historical global catastrophe. That was always possible. Even before Russian forces entered into Ukraine, the White House promised us that would not happen: ""There is no intention or interest or desire by the president to send troops to Ukraine."" That was the word from Biden's publicist from the White House. She said the very same thing almost identically the next month.  

The month after that, she said it again, ""Joe Biden does not have the intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine,"" Jen Psaki solemnly pledged to the nation. Why did Jen Psaki keep saying the same thing over and over? Well, because it wasn't true. She had to repeat it because it was a lie. That's a lying works. It's not believable so you have to say it again and again and again. If you want if someone's lying, count the times they assert something. The more often they assert it, the less likely this to be true, but ultimately the truth does come out and this weekend it began to. Joe Biden's top surrogate in the Congress—that would be Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a former Biden intern — appeared on CBS News and said the opposite of what the White House has been telling us for months. Coons demanded that the Pentagon deploy American troops to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers. 

In some public remarks this week, you said the country needs to talk about when it might be willing to send troops to Ukraine. 

If Vladimir Putin, who has shown us how brutal he can be, is allowed to just continue to massacre civilians, to commit war crimes throughout Ukraine, without NATO, without the West coming more forcefully to his aid, I deeply worry that what's going to happen next is that we will see Ukraine turn into Syria. The American people cannot turn away from this tragedy in Ukraine. I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine and that Putin will only stop when we stop him.  

""Without the West coming more forcefully to the aid of Ukraine."" So, the Ukrainian military has been trained by NATO. It uses American arms. In some cases, it's being led by Americans. The Ukrainian government is advised directly moment-to-moment by Americans. There are many Americans in Ukraine right now doing that. So, what Chris Coons is calling for is land war with Russia. Now, that's not a small thing, given that once again, Chris Coons is Joe Biden's closest ally in the Senate. Chris Coons is an unfailing and faithful spokesman for the administration's policies, whatever those policies happen to be.  

When Chris Coons calls for war with Russia, he does not do it accidentally and in this case, the White House has not distanced itself from what Chris Coons said. Oh, why? Well, because war with Russia is the administration's actual policy. Leaders of the Democratic Party want to topple the Russian government by force and effect regime change in Russia. They have wanted this since the day that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential race. We know this because they've said so many, many times and the only reason the rest of us missed it is because we didn't take them seriously enough, but we should have.  

A hot war with Vladimir Putin, using American troops, is the logical, maybe inevitable end stage of Russiagate. So, the whole thing began with Hillary Clinton complaining, then the pee tape and now it's moving toward nuclear war. So, what that look like, a hot war with Russia? How many Americans would die during that war? How likely is it to escalate to nuclear conflict? And if we succeed, if we remove Vladimir Putin from office, who will replace him as the head of Russia in charge of 6,000 nuclear weapons? 

Those are some of the first questions that jump to mind when war with Russia is discussed. But the news reader on CBS, who was interviewing Chris Coons didn't bother to ask any of those questions, nor did she ask the one thing you would need to know if you were running a functioning democracy, which is how many Americans, how many voters, actually want war with Russia? What percentage of the American population believes that Ukraine's borders are worth dying for? That's a central question in a democracy, and as it happens, we know the answer because CBS itself ran a poll on that topic just a week ago, and they ask this question: Should the United States send troops to Ukraine?  

Answer? Fully 75% of Americans said no, the United States should not send troops to Ukraine. Yet somehow the CBS newsreader forgot to mention any of this to Chris Coons. Why? Well, you know why, because in Washington, what you think is irrelevant. Our foreign policy, matters of life and death, decisions that destroy nations, are made entirely by people with no skin in the game, people who face no conceivable risk of injury, people like John Bolton,Max Boot and Toria Nuland. Your opinion doesn't factor into the equation at any point.  

So, if you're bothered to ask American citizens what they think (and if you care about democracy, you would) they'd likely tell you that their borders are more important to them than Ukraine's borders are. That makes sense because they're Americans, not Ukrainians. And if you ask deeper, you would find out that at the very top of their concerns is not Ukraine. They feel sympathy for the people of Ukraine, but they're not taking up too much disk space brooding about Ukraine moment to moment because they have other things to worry about, starting with their own economy, especially the cost of food, energy and housing. They're worried about these things and they're right to be worried. At this point, the United States is looking at a grim economic picture. 

Highest inflation in 40 years. Those are the official numbers, which of course, bear no resemblance to the day-to-day reality. Everything is much more expensive and that's especially true of the big things. The big things are the most expensive of all. Why is that? Simple, the declining power of U.S. currency has created an unprecedented asset bubble. That means investors around the world are rushing to convert increasingly worthless U.S. dollars into objects that might hold value over time. So, anything tangible costs a lot more, a lot more than it did a year ago. There's no mystery in this. This is exactly what happens when you pump too much money into an economy. The money becomes worth less.  

So, where is this going? How's it going to unfold? Nobody believes the interest rate rises we're seeing will get inflation under control quickly. So, what happens? Well, at some point consumers will begin to run out of cash to spend. Assets will become too expensive to buy and the average person will have less money to buy them. At the same time that prices are rising, so are taxes. Property taxes are rising in many places in tandem with the real estate bubble. So even if you didn't buy a new house, you will suffer because of that. State income taxes have risen dramatically in places like New York. So, they're getting it from both ends and that means that some people, maybe a lot of people, will start to go broke and as they do go broke, they'll be forced to curtail what they buy. 

In an economy driven largely by consumer spending, this is a very scary trend. When people stop buying things, the crash comes. So, you can see very clearly where this is going. Everyone in Washington understands exactly where it's going, but instead of taking real steps to fix it, like stop writing these massive spending bills, they're taking everything they can. All the money is still on the table while there still is money.  

Janet Yellen, the secretary of the Treasury, declared last week, for example, that ""we must redouble our efforts to decarbonize our economy."" So, what does that mean exactly? How do you decarbonize an economy? Well, by spending trillions in new stimulus spending on renewable energy schemes that, by the way, are owned by the Chinese government and Democratic donors. 

See how that works? You pass the cash around while it still exists. Another name for this is looting. It cannot go on forever, by definition, because if the economy tanks, everything resets, not just the economic questions. There could be genuine social and political volatility. Our current conversation can only happen in a country that still believes itself to be rich, but once the country doesn't think it’s rich, everything changes. This tells you exactly why our leaders seem so jumpy.  

It's why they're more determined than ever to move the conversation away from economics (""No talking about economics!"") and toward questions of race and obscure sexual politics. Every new moral panic they create—and they create them by the dozens—diverts attention away from themselves. They've been doing this for quite a while, since at least the financial crisis. Since that time (2008/2009) our leaders have been telling us over and over and over again—many books have been written about it—that the central divide in America, the seeping wound, the original sin, is race.  

Consider the timing. At exactly the moment the U.S. government bailed out Wall Street, not popular move, use of the terms race and racism in The Washington Post, The New York Times and USA Today jumped by more than 700%. So, the official message was really clear: you've got problems and White men caused those problems. The White guys are taking all the money and the perks for themselves and they're holding everyone else down. 

Now to this day, you hear that constantly, including from Joe Biden. It's the most divisive possible message. It's also, factually speaking, a lie. According to federal statistics, White men aren't even close to the richest group in the United States. Indian-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Filipinos, Koreans, Indonesians, among others all have much higher median household incomes than Whites. So, the story is not only destructive of the social fabric, it's not even true. The actual fault line in American life is not color. It's money. 

The real problem isn't racism, it's wealth distribution. A small number of people, smaller every year, have become richer than anyone else in history. Meanwhile, the rest of the country has stagnated and if you don't believe that, drive out 20 miles from the city center and see how people are doing.  

So, if the population understood this—that effectively it's an economics game, it's got nothing to do with racism or transgenders —the population would be pretty mad about that. Joe Biden and his donors fear that. They don't want you to think about economics. They prefer to keep you paralyzed by guilt and shame and if that doesn't work, they'd rather be worried about Ukraine. ""Ukraine is the real scandal where economic problems are Putin's fault."" 

So this is their last desperate talking point and it's highly familiar to anyone who's watched American politics for the last six years (""Putin did it!""), but it's ridiculous and we feel it's always a moral obligation to rebut it with facts. Charts clearly show it.

Several core measures of inflation began spiking in what year? 2021—right after Joe Biden took office. It was the spending that did it. He's not the only one who spent too much, but he spent the most. Now, Biden could claim the spike started this February and the media would probably protect him, but things have gotten so obvious (economic decline being the one thing you really can't hide because people feel it every single day) that the media are beginning to stop defending. 

So, no one's buying it because everyone understands the most simple principle in all economics, which is supply and demand. If you create a lot more money, the money loses its value, obviously, and yet this administration proposes spending even more money at a scale that this country has never seen. The founder of FedEx, Fred Smith, summed it up this way: ""Had we pass the Build Back Better bill that Biden wanted, my guess is that we would be Weimar Germany right now. We'd have 25% inflation rather than 9% or 10%.""  

That's all very obvious, and again, you don't need to be running the Fed to understand it. Joe Biden may be the only person who doesn't understand. In this case, he gets a pass because in Joe Biden's head, he's far away, he's somewhere else. Yesterday, for example, Biden was fumbling through questions about foreign policy when a staffer in an Easter Bunny costume appeared out of nowhere and led him away. It's that bad now? How bad is it? Here's Biden in one of the saddest moments of his or any other presidency. 

Shaking imaginary hands, wandering off into the great distance, So the one thing we can say with certainty about the White House in the spring of 2022 is that Joe Biden is not running it. Joe Biden has gone. In his place are unelected ideologues, people who do not care what the price of gas is. They don't care if you can afford dinner at Applebee's with your kids. They don't care even if war with Russia could cause the destruction of entire populations. Those things are not interesting to them. They care about theories, not reality. So, improving the life of Americans, elevating the American population, doesn't even rate on their scale of concern. It's a pure afterthought.  

Now we've known that for a while. They've been in charge for a while and that's been sustainable as long as everyone's getting a check, as long as everyone feels like ""I've got enough money,"" but the second the economy turns south, the calculation changes completely. Everything is different in a country that believes it's becoming poor. The short-term effect is a peaceful revolt by voting. 

So, you can be certain of this: if there are free and fair elections this November, neo liberalism will be swept away entirely, revealed as the joke it is. The thing to worry about right now is not public opinion. Public opinion is settled. Nobody likes this. The thing to worry about right now is voting, the mechanics of voting. If the public is allowed to express its preference in the midterms, we're done, but will they be allowed? That should be the thing people are paying attention to.

643	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-libs-tiktok-oust-campaign-twitter	2022-04-19 22:47:00	Tucker: Libs of TikTok oust campaign was designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' to the woman behind 'Libs of TikTok' being outed.

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Last year, unbeknownst to pretty much nobody, a woman in Brooklyn started a Twitter account that was comprised almost solely of videos of liberals talking about themselves. The concept was very simple: Find interesting tape that had already been uploaded to the internet by the people who made it and then repost that tape. There was no editing of it, no special effects. There was very little editorial content.  

The idea was to let activist-types describe, in their own words, what they believe, unfiltered. The woman who created it called that account ""Libs of TikTok."" Libs of TikTok now has more followers than the entire population of the state of Wyoming. Libs of TikTok's audience dwarfs the nightly viewership on CNN. 

So, it was quite successful by definition. The question is why?  

Here's why: It turns out that is repellent as academic lifestyle liberalism may seem to you as an observer. The reality of it, as described by the people who actually believe this stuff, is even worse than you ever imagined. It's really beyond belief, both idiotic and disgusting. It's like watching someone eat roadkill. You feel nauseous, but you can't turn away. So, Libs of TikTok not only found all kinds of tape on the internet, but they found a bunch of selfie-style videos from the publicly available social media accounts of teachers. They didn't snoop. They just put what people already posted. Here's some of what they found:

So those are the people in charge of tending to your small children's minds while you're at work. Now maybe you agree with the views you just heard. Maybe you think that doctors just guess at the sex of newborns. Maybe you don't agree. It almost doesn't matter. Either way, you have a right as a parent to know what these people are teaching to your children. And yet, before Libs of TikTok, there was not an easy way to find out what they were teaching. You take the teacher's word for it. 

Well, it turns out there are an awful lot of videos like this out there. Libs of TikTok found a lot of them. Here, for example, is the scene at one private school in Washington, D.C..:

OK, so let's say you're paying $45,000 a year to send your kids to some overrated, mediocre private school in the District of Columbia. You think everything's fine. You pull up Libs of TikTok and you find out what's actually happening in your kid's classroom. What's wrong with that? This is journalism. No news organization in America has done more to reveal the reality within American schools than Libs of TikTok. 

We aired a number of their videos on the show, and we are grateful for their reporting. It was far more straightforward than anything you're going to find in The New York Times or The Washington Post, because it wasn't accompanied by a lot of bloviating. They just showed you the tape, and you can decide. That's journalism. Here's another piece of tape that Libs of TikTok unearthed that amazed and horrified us. This is a teacher screaming at a student for refusing to wear a mask:

""I'm going to call the police,"" he screeches, because the kid has the mask beneath his nose. Now again, maybe you're OK with your kids being taught by emotionally incontinent nutcases like that. Maybe you're not. But you probably ought to know either way. 

So, you can see why Libs of TikTok quickly became so very popular. You didn't have to wade through some long editorial to find out what was actually happening. You could see the raw video and again, you could assess it for yourself. Millions of parents were grateful for that.  

So, is Christina Pushaw who is the press secretary for the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. It was partly in response to videos that she saw on Libs of TikTok that Florida ultimately banned public school teachers from lecturing kindergartners about sex. That's no lie. It's one of the most popular laws in the state. A majority of Democrats support it. So, Libs of TikTok was getting results as good journalism does. Not bad for a Twitter feed. 

So, of course, that Twitter feed had to be shut down. The Biden administration and its many servants in the news media set off to work. The neoliberal slander machine Media Matters published four separate hit pieces on Libs of TikTok in just the past three weeks. It was trafficking hate for allowing liberals to talk about themselves. It was anti-gay as if the site was attacking anyone.  

Certainly, it was not attacking gays. It was just playing tape of people talking about themselves in their own words—video that they uploaded. 

Well, Twitter could not stand this. They shut down the account entirely twice. They suspended it. One of the suspensions came after a complaint from a Harvard law instructor called Alejandra Caraballo.

""My report on Libs of TikTok violating Twitter rules got them suspended,"" she bragged. Yet the woman who runs Libs of TikTok kept going.  

So ultimately, Jeff Bezos weighed in. Bezos' personal newspaper, The Washington Post, decided to harass the family of the woman who operates the Libs of TikTok. They couldn't find her, so they went after her family. The Post sent what it calls its tech columnist, Taylor Lorenz, to show up outside a home that belongs to one of the woman's relatives and then Lorenz set about trying to find the woman herself. 

She couldn't. She sent a direct message on Twitter to someone who turned out to be not that woman and had nothing to do with the account whatsoever. But because she did that, we know what Taylor Lorenz was saying.  

Here's what she said: ""You're being implicated in starting a hate campaign against LGBTQ people."" Right, a hate campaign. So here you have Taylor Lorenz, who's effectively acting as the Stasi for the Deep State, trying to intimidate a private citizen into silence and this morning she gave her best shot. The Washington Post published a piece by Lorenz linking to the name, the physical address and the real estate licensing information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok. 

After the Post published the article, the woman behind Libs of TikTok went into hiding. That was, of course, the whole point of the exercise. People know where she lives because The Washington Post linked to it, so she had to leave.

Now, Taylor Lorenz, of all people, knew this would happen. She knew what she was doing when she wrote the story. She was trying to shut this woman up. It was just a couple of months ago, you might remember, that Lorenz herself complained on television that she was being harassed and that no one under any circumstances would be allowed to show up at her home. Here she is:

""Oh, they go after your family members!"" Could we put that picture back up? Can the control room do that? This is Taylor Lorenz outside the family members of the woman who run Libs of TikTok the other day harassing the family members. Now the tape you just saw comes from January. Then in April, just eight days ago, Taylor Lorenz, who cannot stop talking about herself, drowning in Lake Me, cried on television because she'd been criticized online. Watch:

It's really hard to be from Greenwich and work for The Washington Post. It's hard. No power. But if you really think it's hard, if you're really against that kind of behavior, why are you engaging in it at scale?

So a few weeks later, after shooting that performance, Taylor Lorenz shows up at the door—and there's the picture right there – of a relative of the private citizen who posts videos that Taylor Lorenz's bosses don't like, and then she posts that person's identity online.  

So this is obviously an intimidation campaign designed to shut down a highly effective Twitter feed. But take one step deeper into the story and ask yourself: Did Taylor Lorenz, the woman you just saw crying on TV because she has PTSD, did she really do the reporting here? Did she really track down the personal information of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Please, of course not. She couldn't.

Taylor Lorenz is not a reporter. Apart from whining about herself on television, she has no skills. She couldn't do a weather forecast in a rainstorm. She's not a journalist. She's merely a receptacle for information that other people gather for their own ends, a willing receptacle.  

So where did she get this information? Who gave her the identity of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok? Well, actually, we don't have to guess because today's Washington Post story answers that question. The Post piece tells us that information came from a man called Travis Brown. Travis Brown runs the ""Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker,"" which uses a variety of proprietary methods to reveal personally identifying information of private citizens who stray from the approved storyline.  

Now, who pays for all this? That's the question. Well, the ""Travis Brown Hate Speech Tracker"" is funded by something called the prototype fund. Here's how the prototype fund describes the point of Travis Brown's project: ""Prominent right-wing extremist accounts on Twitter and Facebook have developed a well-documented pattern to distribute controversial and extremist content to their followers and then delete it before moderators have the opportunity to react to it. In other words, before it can be censored. ""Archiving is an important element in counteracting this behavior and has in many cases led to prominent victories in the fight against the supreme extreme right."" 

Extreme right? So, not all hate speech is the same. The hate speech tracker does not target the hate speech of BLM rioters or Antifa. No, only enemies of the Biden administration and the guys at Davos. How do they do it? Well, Brown's methods, according to him, include using automated software to save user account names and social media posts long after they have been deleted.

So, there's no hiding from these people. Now, that appears to be a violation of Twitter's terms of service. Not that we care because they don't care. 

We reached out to Twitter about this. Isn't this a violation? Well, they ignored us. They suspended our account.  

What's interesting, though, is that Travis Brown himself appears to be a former Twitter employee. So again, who's paying for this? Well, a foreign government is paying for it. The prototype fund gets its money not from private donors, but from the government of Germany—Germany's Federal Ministry of Education. It says so right on the website.  

In other words, what happened to the woman who runs Libs of TikTok, her life being destroyed, was not the work of Taylor Lorenz, the fearless journalist who cries on TV from her PTSD. No, it was a foreign intelligence operation designed to silence and intimidate an American citizen. Wait, is that legal?  

Did the Biden administration have any role in this particular intel op? Why is the German government trying to shut down an American Twitter account posting about American teachers? And since she was the recipient, the willing recipient, of this information from a foreign government designed to destroy an American citizen, why hasn't Taylor Lorenz, at the very least, registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA)?  

We seem to remember quite a bit of talk about this over the last year. We think there was an impeachment trial of it. Someone went to prison because of it, but Taylor Lorenz can take information from a foreign government to crush an American citizen, clearly as part of an Intel operation, and she's a journalist in good standing at Jeff Bezos' newspaper? Lots of questions here. We hope we can get to the bottom of all of them.

644	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-bidens-most-loyal-constituency-has-turned-on-him-vengeance	2022-04-20 22:33:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden's most loyal constituency has turned on him with a vengeance | Fox News	"Fox News host weighs in on reports Biden will run for reelection on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you've seen video of Joe Biden mumbling in public recently — and we bet you have — there's probably not anything we could tell you tonight that's going to surprise you.  

Would you be shocked to learn that Joe Biden recently got lost in his own bedroom? That he introduced a table lamp as his wife? That he bragged to the Japanese prime minister about saving Marie Antoinette's life during a cavalry charge in the Crimean War? Probably not. Now, we can't say that any of these things actually happened, but they could have. They're entirely plausible and if you think that's a mean thing to say, don't worry, Joe Biden will never know.  

At this point, other people are not real to Joe Biden. He lives in a world of ghosts and fog shrouded memories, but you knew that because you've seen the tape. Maybe the only thing that would surprise you about Joe Biden, 15 months into his presidency, is learning that he plans to run for reelection. Now, that would be outlandish, impossible really, ridiculous. 

Where Joe Biden is somehow able to stay in the White House, he would be 86 years old by the end of his second term. Do the math on that. Even now, at 79, past the life expectancy of the average American man, Joe Biden can barely speak English and that is not a trend that will improve with time.  

What kind of president would Joe Biden be by the year 2028? You shudder to think about that, though you can bet that more Botox and hair plugs would not improve him. The whole idea is grotesque. Weekend at Bernie's White House Edition. It's an insult to the principle of self-government, but that doesn't mean it's not coming. According to a piece this week in The Hill newspaper, Joe Biden has confided in his old boss, Barack Obama, that he does in fact plan to run for reelection. 

Joe Biden believes he is ""the only one who can beat Donald Trump,"" which, if nothing else, suggests that Joe Biden believes he beat Donald Trump the first time. ""Hey, guys, I got 81 million votes. Maybe I'll get 500 million next time."" So how did Barack Obama respond to that? Well, The Hill newspaper didn't say. We do know that earlier this month, Obama referred to Joe Biden as ""vice president,"" so you can guess.  

Obama never hid the fact that he didn't like or respect Joe Biden. Obama thought Biden was fake and incompetent, old, White and annoying, and that was 10 years ago. So, you can imagine how Obama feels about the prospect of an 86-year-old President Joe Biden. Now, Michelle Obama, by contrast, will have just turned 60 by the time the next presidential election rolls around. So clearly it's her turn.  

It's not just Obama who feels this way, a lot of Democrats agree. Just for the sake of amusement this morning we tried to find a Democratic Party official who be willing to go on the record to endorse a second Joe Biden candidacy and we couldn't find a single one. Now, keep in mind, these are the same people who are delighted to tell you that you can change your biological sex just by wishing it so, like Dorothy clicking her heels at Oz. Boom, you're transgender now. 

 They consider that believable. Yet they will not tell you that Joe Biden should be president again. A Biden reelection campaign is just too absurd, even for them. It strains credulity past the breaking point. Joe Biden? Come on. That's the consensus in Washington tonight and for once it is correct. So given that, now you know what is going on with the news media. Joe Biden's most loyal constituency has turned on him with a vengeance. After getting the mannequin elected, the White House press corps is telling you night after night he's a loser. Why are they saying this? Because they don't want to run again. They know he will lose. 

CNN reminded you Joe Biden is now less popular than most sexually-transmitted diseases.

OK, so that's one piece of tape, but it's not just a single, oily poll reader on CNN. Pretty much every media outlet in the country is saying the same things. They've gone beyond reading the terrible poll numbers, and now they're agreeing with the terrible poll numbers. Here's chief Biden toady Chuck Todd of NBC ""news"" turning on his former patron live on television. It's like a scene from The Godfather. Ooh, the betrayal. 

Oh, they're easy to roll. Of course, they're easy to roll. No one respects the old guy. He is past his prime. Ignore him, he's napping and that was Joe Biden's biggest fan talking. Chuck Todd is the guy who once informed you it was immoral not to vote for the dementia patient from Delaware.  

""This is a national emergency. Suspend disbelief. Ignore what you see. Don't call Joe Biden senile. That's a hate crime. It's ageism."" And the shouting works. It always works. So, for a while, almost nobody said the obvious. Of course, everybody knew it. It was impossible not to know it. 

In case you've forgotten, here's what Joe Biden looked like during the last presidential campaign:  

""You know, the thing,"" and indeed we did know the thing. We recognize the thing immediately. It's called galloping dementia. It's a very sad thing. It's coming for a lot of us. On the other hand, a lot of us are not the president of the United States. Leaders of big countries have to be able to think clearly. Joe Biden couldn't do that. He has not been able to do that for years now, but you would never know the truth about Joe Biden from the news coverage that surrounded and protected him for more than a year.  

Here's a representative sample of the happy talk you saw on night after night on television. You'll notice if you listen carefully to it that it has a strained, almost desperate quality to it. They knew they were lying, but they didn't think they had a choice. ""Dad's not drunk again. He's just really tired."" Watch.  

Hallelujah. So no, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden isn't staring blankly off into the middle distance. He is not reading lists of cliches he couldn't possibly understand. No, not at all. That's not what you're seeing here. Joe Biden is emoting. He's healing. He's soaring on the rhetoric of Pericles above a grateful nation, propelled aloft by gentle zephyrs of hope. That's what Joe Biden is doing. Oh, please. 

 Why couldn't they just tell us the truth? We saw it ourselves. It might have helped. If the media had been honest before the election, Mark Zuckerberg might not have dropped $419 million to swing the outcome of the election and this would be a different country, but it's too late now. We're stuck with him. So here he is. This is from a televised event this fall. You'll notice, among other things, that Biden is holding out his hands like a doll for no obvious reason.  

That was from a CNN special. It's a full hour designed, produced, to showcase Joe Biden's strengths and his fundamental awesomeness. Now imagine what he must be like around the office, where there are no cameras or special injections from the White House physicians to clear his head. It's got to be Thanksgiving at the rest home, with Biden sitting alone making designs in his mashed potatoes. His coworkers are clearly worn out by this, if not affirmatively sick of the whole thing. Watch what happened at the White House earlier this month and remember, that virtually everyone in the room works for Joe Biden, but they're ignoring him anyway.  

 So that's the polite version of what happened that day. Here's the scene moments later with Barack Obama, the rudest president in American history. Obama never liked Joe Biden and he's hardly going to start pretending to now.   

We could play clip, after clip, after clip. We've got a whole montage of Joe Biden referring to Kamala Harris as the president of the United States. Spoiler alert: she's not, but why belabor it? The whole thing's depressing. You get it. Everyone gets it. The Democratic Party installed Joe Biden in a last desperate effort to stop the economic populism of Bernie Sanders and then in the general election, in an effort to silence the uncontrollable talking of Donald Trump.  

To be clear, permanent Washington never feared what Donald Trump would do. They were just pretending to fear that. What actually legitimately terrified them was what Donald Trump might say. What if Trump started noting obvious things and then the whole system came tumbling down? That could happen. Words are the one thing you can't take back, so it was not worth the risk to keep Trump. It absolutely had to be Joe Biden.  

They assume Joe Biden will be grateful for the promotion, a ceremonial retirement gig, one last government signature before the end, but somewhere along the way, things changed as they often do. Joe Biden forgot the terms of the deal. He started running up to microphones and pretending to be president. At a certain point, the kabuki went to his head, and then he decided he might actually run for reelection. ""What the hell? I got 81 million votes the first time."" For the Democratic Party, this was disaster. Frankenstein had escaped the lab, so they had to take him out, and now they are.

Here's an interesting story. If the New Yorker was still a real magazine, they might write it up, but of course they won't. Here it is: Last summer, deep in the bowels of the Transportation Department in Washington, some nameless federal analysts came across a highly puzzling trend in a pile of stats on traffic deaths.  

It turns out that in the year 2020, the number of American motorists who died on the roads spiked dramatically. Traffic deaths rose by more than 10% in a single year. Now, in any year, that would be odd and distressing, but coming as it did in 2020, it was flat out bizarre because as you'll remember, in 2020, there was a pandemic. It had just started. Millions of people stayed home that year. They did not drive to work. Many didn't drive at all.  

In 2020, roads were less crowded than they had been in decades in this country. So, of course, you would expect far fewer traffic deaths—less traffic, fewer people dying in traffic—and yet there were more traffic deaths. You think that's weird? It gets weirder. If you look deeper into the numbers, you saw that not only were more Americans dying in cars in the year 2020, a staggering number of those who died were Black.  

Traffic deaths among African Americans rose by nearly 25% in a single year. That's unprecedented. So, in a normal presidential administration, that question, ""why is this happening?"" would be the subject of urgent academic study. ""People are dying, let's figure out why."" But in this administration, it was not the subject of urgent academic study. Why? Because Pete Buttigieg is now the secretary of transportation. Buttigieg once worked at McKinsey, so he already knew the cause of these deaths and it was, needless to say, racism.  

Racism did it because America's roads are racist. They're killing Black people. As the Washington Post put it, the Transportation Department ""concluded that Black communities tend to be crisscrossed by more dangerous roads."" Now, that made sense to the Washington Post and you can see why. Civil engineers, road builders, bent on genocide would, needless to say, put all the dangerous roads in Black neighborhoods. That's who they are and that kind of thing happens all the time in America. This is a racist country; Joe Biden has told us that countless times.  

What doesn't make sense is the timing here. Very few of these racist roads are new. Most of them had been there a long time. So, why did so many Black motorists suddenly start dying in the year 2020? Pete Buttigieg had no idea. He didn't even bother to guess because honestly, he didn't really care, but we do care. We've got a theory and here it is: If you look at the numbers, you will notice that traffic deaths among African Americans in the year 2020 surged in the month of June.  

Fatalities among Black drivers in June 2020 were fully 55% higher than they were in June of 2019. You never see increases like that. What could have happened? Well, let's see. It was in the last week of May of 2020 that a convicted felon called George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis and after that you'll recall everything changed. What changed, most of all, was how we regard the rule of law.  

As Russ Martin of the Governors Highway Safety Association put it, Floyd's death ""accelerated national discussion about equity in transportation"" and that discussion would include ""questions about enforcement."" Oh, there it is, right there. That's the answer. Cops across the country were told to stop enforcing traffic laws against Black drivers. No one wanted to be accused of arresting somebody for the crime of ""driving while Black."" So, in the name of equity, the law no longer applied to huge numbers of people. Result? Thousands of Americans died.  

This is a trend, you may have noticed, and it doesn't just apply to traffic and it doesn't just cause traffic deaths. If you look closely at a chart that shows the number of Black Americans murdered every year from 2010 to 2020, you'll notice two major spikes. One spike came in 2014. That was exactly the moment the media decided to lie to us about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Activists then used that false story to drive police out of Black neighborhoods in many parts of America. That was supposed to make things better. Fewer cops, less racism. Right? No. And that effect? A lot of people got killed and most of them were Black.

  

Then there's the second spike in the last decade, the biggest one yet. As we said, it came in the summer of 2020 and it's continuing today. Same reason, same effect. There aren't a lot of trends in social science that can be explained in a single graph, but this is one of them. Less law enforcement means more crime and over time it means more dead children, more grieving parents. You don't need to be a criminologist to understand this. It's very obvious. Even Lori Lightfoot gets it.  

Lori Lightfoot is the mayor of Chicago. Thanks to her equity-based policies, the city of Chicago is falling apart. People are dying in huge numbers. Shootings in Chicago jumped 60% last year. Lori Lightfoot knows perfectly well this is happening. She knows why it is happening, but Lori Lightfoot doesn't care. Lori Lightfoot is so uninterested in all of those deaths, mostly of Black people, that she won't even answer questions about them when asked. This comes from Tuesday of this week.  

""Next question?"" So, Lori Lightfoot won't answer the question precisely because she knows the answer. In the name of equity, officials in Chicago have stopped enforcing the law and not some esoteric tax law that no one really understands, the basic laws like you can't hurt other people. They're releasing criminals who go on to murder more citizens. This is the triumph of ideology over human life. Here's just one example it comes from FOX's Chicago station:

Stories like this constantly in the city of Chicago, cities across the country. They are always the same, but the details of this one tell you everything. A criminal runs from the police carrying an illegal gun. Then the same politicians, who never stop lecturing you about gun control, (""It's immoral to defend yourself,"" they scream at you.) those same people at this guy who used a gun to commit a crime, out of jail immediately because equity. Then he gets rid of his ankle monitor and commits a carjacking. Then what happens? Well, Lori Lightfoot's friends release him once again because ""incarceration, bad."" So, what does he do? He drives off to shoot and kill a 15-year-old, because why wouldn't he? There's no penalty. 

Now, if tragedies like this happened, occasionally you would call them accidents. You would feel sad, but you wouldn't be bothered. These are not accidents. This is happening every day in the city of Chicago. Fully, 43% of all criminals convicted in the state of Illinois commit new crimes within three years of being released and some are released very early. That's a high number compared to other states.  

In saner places like Texas, South Carolina and West Virginia, the recidivism rate after three years is about half of that. What's the difference? Politics. Honestly, it's not a partisan talking point. It's true. For the last decade, for example, the most liberal state in the country, California, has recorded a recidivism rate of nearly 50%.  

Now, keep in mind the irony here. They tell you that we shouldn't incarcerate people because incarceration doesn't work and if you want to rehabilitate people, we have to let them out. But they're not rehabilitated. That's what they're re-offending and almost 50% in the state of California. Incarceration has two purposes. One is to improve the prisoner so he won't re-offend, but the main purpose is to protect the rest of us who aren't committing crimes, who've got kids who just want to live a normal life. They've forgotten that part.  

So, every day in California, politicians release truly dangerous criminals back into the public sphere and this is why you're now taking a very big risk if you dare to use public transportation in the city of Los Angeles. You could be shot or sexually assaulted and we're not guessing. We have the tape.

 There's surveillance footage from L.A's. transit system. It includes pictures of a woman being raped in public as she's sitting down. That happened in public and it happens a lot, that kind of thing. We went to L.A. for the premiere of season two of our documentary series. We went there because we want to understand, how one man, a man called George Gascón, a prosecutor backed by George Soros, could have done so much in such little time to destroy the city and of course, he did it in the name of equity. We talked to the family of a murder victim called Fatima Johnson. It was a bracing conversation.  

George Gascón is not the only corrupt prosecutor who is doing this. George Soros has paid for people just like George Gascón in many American cities: Kim Foxx in Chicago; Larry Krasner in Philadelphia; Alvin Bragg now in Manhattan; others. In every case, many Americans, thousands overall, have died as a result. So, who's benefiting from this slaughter and how exactly are they benefiting? That's a fair question. You've got to wonder. We do know for certain that voters don't want it.  

Americans want the laws they voted for to be enforced and that is true of Black voters just like any others because why wouldn't it be? Sorry, White liberals, Black people don't love crime. Actually, you're not helping Black people by increasing the amount of crime in their neighborhoods and a new Pew Poll proves this.  

The poll asked Black adults what they cared about most and guess what? It wasn't racism and diversity or equity. That was near the bottom of the list. What they cared about most was ""violence and crime."" That's what they cared about. Why wouldn't they care about it? So, as Pete Buttigieg frets about racist roads, thousands of Black people are dying of gunshot wounds. Normal people are sick of this. In San Francisco, the lunatic equity mongering D.A., there Chesa Boudin is facing recall, which could succeed. Boudin has, among other things, encouraged open-air narcotics markets throughout the city of San Francisco and as a result, you guessed it, more than twice as many people have died from drug ODs in San Francisco than from COVID.  

Who could support something like that? You'd have to be pretty out of touch. Well, singer John Legend does, ""I endorse Chesa for D.A. when he ran for election,"" Legend tweeted, ""and I support him now."" Of course, you do, John Legend. The Biden administration supports him, too. Just days ago, police in Washington rented an apartment where they found a dog called Pablo. The dog had been stolen at gunpoint by thieves who also took drugs and money at gunpoint. Police arrested four men, three juveniles in the apartment. A few hours later, Joe Biden's Justice Department announced he was refusing to charge any of them.  

So what happens when you allow people to commit violence, the one thing the state can never do? The state has a monopoly on violence. In a democracy, we decide when violence is appropriable. What happens when you allow anti-social elements to commit all the violence they want? You get a lot of violence and your city start to resemble Third World hellholes. People were executed in broad daylight and no one bothered to call the cops. That just happened in Atlanta.  

Something really wrong with everyone in that video, except the dead man. There's something really wrong with the rest of us for putting up with this and not figuring out why exactly it's happening. It's a little more complicated than racism and mass incarceration. Something really dark is going on, but we can say that these sorts of things happen a lot more than they otherwise would when you decide that law should be applied on the basis of skin color.  

When you decide that, a lot of people die. They bleed out in gutters, on city streets as the rest of the neighborhood hides indoors in terror and as it happens, most of the dead come from the very group our leaders say they're protecting. ""We love you so much, we're letting you die."" That's the equity agenda. Too bad BLM never told us how it was going to end.

We told you earlier in the week about how the left is very mad, in fact trying to shut down a site called Libs of TikTok. Why are they so mad at Libs of TikTok?  

Well, here's one of the reasons: Over the past half a year or so, video after video has appeared on social media showing schoolteachers bragging enthusiastically about how they push their personal sexual politics, often weird and gruesome sexual politics, on the small children they're supposed to be teaching. Now the students in question are not teenagers, they're kindergartners, first graders, kids who have no perspective on life and no power to fight back.  

So many parents saw these videos, in some cases on Libs of TikTok and they were shocked. They had no idea that anything like this was happening in the classroom. Having some purple-haired loser in a nose ring convince your six-year-old to get a sex change is not why most people send their children to school, so they complained, the parents did, and across the country, Republican officeholders responded by promising to do something about this. They made outraged noises but then in very short order, they moved on to talking about , which is what they really care about, not you.  

In the end, only one state really did anything about this. That would be the state of Florida under Ron DeSantis. Several weeks ago, the Florida Legislature passed a law banning teachers from bragging about their own sex lives to small children. Now, news reporters went crazy. They described this legislation as the ""Don't Say Gay Bill,"" but as always, that was a lie. This bill didn't even mention the word ""gay."" It had nothing to do with gays. Florida voters seem to know that intuitively. Even most Democrats in Florida supported this law. 

The polling firm Public Opinion Strategies found out why they do: ""Fully two-thirds of voters believe it is inappropriate for teachers or school personnel to discuss gender identity with children in kindergarten through third grade."" Well, of course it is. Everyone thinks that. So, if there was ever a law that accurately reflected public opinion, which should matter in a democracy, this was the law, but across the country, in the state of California, Bob Iger was watching and Bob Iger didn't like it.  

Bob Iger is the 71-year-old former head of Disney. He's a bundler for Hillary Clinton. He's got some free time and strong political views. He promptly tweeted the Florida law was immoral, somehow. In an interview later with CNN, with Chris Wallace, Iger explained that preventing teachers from promoting gender reassignment surgery to kindergartners was ""harmful to children."" Iger never explained how this was harmful, but it didn't matter.  

Over at Disney headquarters, his remarks caused huge problems for the company's new CEO, Bob Chapek. Now, by all accounts, Bob Chapek is not especially political. He's not an activist. He's a marketing guy. So, his first instinct was not to get involved, not to comment on what was happening in Florida, and that seemed wise given how much at stake Disney has in Florida. They own a theme park in Orlando, you may have heard. That's an enormous physical asset that cannot be loaded on a truck and moved, so maybe don't mess with Florida.  

As Chapek put it in a memo, ""corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds."" He wrote that on March 7th, explaining why Disney plans to take a pass on this controversy because they make movies, not laws, but Bob Chapek's employees had other ideas. Whipped into a frenzy by their former boss, Bob Iger, Disney staffers demanded action immediately and then because he is weak and not especially bright, Bob Chapek caved to their demands. He agreed to hold a Town Hall with aggrieved Disney employees who wanted him somehow to take control of the Florida Legislature. Here's how that went.  

Hey, Bob, what does LGBTQIA stand for? You have no freaking clue. That's not the interesting part. The interesting part of what you just heard was ""your words have made a real impact on me."" In other words, ""You now have full control over my entire central nervous system. You own my brain. Do with me what you will,"" and they did.  

Bob Chapek soon reversed his position, Disney's position, completely. Going forward, not only did the Disney Corporation fervently disagree with the law the Florida Legislature had passed, according to Bob Chapek, Disney had decided to override the expressed will of Florida's voters and overturn that law: ""Our goal as a company,"" said Bob Chapek, ""is for this law to be repealed by the Legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that."" Whoa! What? And you thought it was an entertainment company, but no!  

From its headquarters in Los Angeles, the Disney Corporation had now decided it runs the state of Florida. So, for people who want to defend democracy, which is a system in which voters get to govern themselves, this was quite a departure. This is oligarchy, corporate CEOs deciding what the laws should be. Yeah. That's their new position, but in the meantime, Disney employees set about trying to undermine the intent of Florida's law. If teachers could no longer promote transgenderism to kindergartners, Disney planned to step into the breach and do it themselves. Here's internal footage from Disney obtained by journalist Chris Rufo:

Last summer, we removed all of the gendered greetings in relationship to our life skills, so we no longer say, ""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls."" We've trained, we've provided training for all of our cast members in relationship to that, so now they know it's, ""Hello everyone"" or ""Hello, friends."" 

Oh, so it's no more ""boys and girls."" Disney World is now non-binary. OK. That's the diversity of inclusion lady. You're not surprised. What is surprising is that the head of a publicly held company like Disney would announce in public that he's in charge of a state that we thought was run by the voters of that state. Well, in Florida, Ron DeSantis noticed this. He's the elected governor and he decided to find out how does the system work. He decided to test democracy.  

So, during a special session of the Florida Legislature this week, DeSantis led an effort to strip Disney of what turned out to be a remarkable set of special perks that company had enjoyed for more than 50 years. You are not treated like Disney is treated in Florida. You have never been treated that well. After the special session, no more will Disney World operate as its own independent country within the state of Florida. Yes, that's how they were governed, by themselves. And now, going forward, Disney is going to have to pay its taxes. Oh, wow, just like everybody else.  

Now, if you've lived in this country for more than, say, five years, ask yourself: what's the political party that has always told you big companies should pay their taxes? ""Corporate tax breaks are bad."" Well, of course, that's always been the Democratic Party. So, you would imagine the Democrats in Florida would applaud a move like this. When was the last time you heard liberals complain about stripping tax breaks from big business? Never before in history. It's never happened. And yet it just did happen. Democrats in the Florida Legislature were are on the verge of tears as they learn that the Disney Corporation might have to pay taxes.  

You may have sensed the Democratic Party over the last decade or so has been captured by corporate interests, but you never thought that you would hear on the floor of a state legislature Democrats scream with anguish at the idea that a big company might have to pay its taxes. Unbelievable, but now very clear.  

What's going on here? Well, a lot of things. Here's one: Disney spends millions of dollars electing lawmakers in the state of Florida, but those lawmakers couldn't do their job in this case. They couldn't act on Disney's behalf. The law passed and DeSantis signed it into law this afternoon, and that's going to cost the Disney Corporation a ton of money, which in turn may mean less money for the Florida Democrats who were shrieking.

So, there were some self-interest involved here, but it wasn't just that because it wasn't just Democratic officeholders who were upset by the idea that an elected governor might be more powerful than an unelected corporation headquartered across the continent. The media were very upset too, very upset. 

If Ron DeSantis could pass an anti-Muslim bill for the state of Florida, he would. If he could pass an anti CRT, if he could say it's illegal to say you're Black, I'm pretty sure the guy would try it.  

I mean, look, DeSantis has, this is a playbook out of Putin, and we saw where this goes.  

It's very Soviet and it's weird how Republicans, they keep tacking back to the old Soviet Union, and they seem to want to mimic the things that the new Soviet Union, meaning Vladimir Putin, is doing.  

And even in our conversations about DeSantis, it's about how well they're serving him. The truth is, dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war. Dehumanization is a, it's a tactic, it's being used right now. The Russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them. Dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war.  

So just to be clear and, by the way, there's clearly some kind of inverse IQ test going on in the hiring department over to MSNBC, but here are the new rules: If you would like a big, publicly held corporation to pay its taxes, then you're a child rapist. Obviously, you're a racist. You're like Putin, which means you're a fascist, but you know what else you are? According to Joy Reid, you're a communist. Ron DeSantis is, ""taking us back to the Soviet Union."" You're a communist if you want the company to pay its taxes. Now, Joy Reid went to Harvard, so we're not going to disagree with her, but we did feel a moral obligation to check that fact because it's a heavy claim.

647	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-elon-musk-tyrants-grieving	2022-04-25 21:52:00	Tucker Carlson: Because of Elon Musk, tyrants are grieving | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Good news, we don't get that often. It's April 25 2022. Elon Musk bought Twitter today. That means that Twitter henceforth will be privately held. Elon Musk will determine what is allowed on the platform.  

Now, why is this significant? Not because it singles the sudden arrival of oligarchy as you're hearing now. It's too late for that; oligarchy is already here. Every major tech company is already controlled by billionaires. That's been the case for a long time, so this is nothing new. The reason today's sale of Twitter is big news, the reason it could turn out to be a pivot point in our history, is that Elon Musk does not agree with the rest of the billionaires in the tech business. Unlike the leaders of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, Elon Musk believes in free speech. He thinks everyone should be allowed to talk, including people who disagree with him.  

""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter,"" Musk wrote today on his new platform."" because that is what free speech means."" Now, that sounds like an entirely American sentiment, but in this atmosphere, that is a revolutionary posture. Of the five companies that control the flow of virtually all information that is consumed by the citizens of this country,  is by far the smallest of the group, but it doesn't matter. One platform going rogue is enough to break the monopoly. That means you now have real options for expressing yourself.  

Going forward if you disagree with the administration's latest directive, you get to say so out loud to an audience. So, they're up there every day from the podium, the biggest megaphone in the world commanding you to hate this or that group, lecturing you about who's good and who's evil as if you're a child and have no right to decide for yourself these things, the basic things, but before today, you didn't have a right to express your disagreement in public. If you had an opposing opinion or even more dangerous than that, if you had countervailing facts that undermine their storyline, the tech companies would shut you down immediately. It happened to us. It happened to a lot of people, most of whom you've never heard of. Never hearing about those people was the whole point of shutting them down. But that's over.  

After today, you'll be able to post your dissent in a place where other people might have a reasonable chance of seeing it. In other words, you will have a chance to change other people's minds just like the White House does every day. So, you just became a little more powerful. The people already in charge just became a little less powerful. It's that simple, and it's that profound.  

Of course, it could change. It's possible that at some point Elon Musk will decide he doesn't really want dissenting views on Twitter. That could happen. Elon Musk can do whatever he wants, just as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever they want and often do. This is the cost to the rest of us of living under a political system that is so dysfunctional it cannot even guarantee the core freedoms it promises its own citizens and free speech is the first on that list. Why? Because democracy depends upon free speech and the irony is, if you'd like to save democracy, you are forced to look outside the democratic system in order to do it. 

At this point, you have no choice but to put your hopes in the good intentions of an eccentric billionaire. There's no other option because no one else is coming to the rescue. So, in the case of Elon Musk, we will see how this turns out, but for now, Musk's purchase of Twitter is the single biggest political development since Donald Trump's election in 2016. It is certainly the most threatening challenge to the corrupt and incompetent leadership of this country. Now, that may not be obvious to everyone yet, but the people in charge certainly understand it. The scene inside Twitter's San Francisco headquarters when the Musk deal was announced was akin to the scene when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. 

It is the collective grief of people who thought they were going to be fully in charge, who totally believed they'd be able to rule without limit. Those people learned that actually other people get to talk too and that realization is crushing to them. It's the one thing they fear and that tells you everything about why those people should never be near power. People who want a monopoly on speech and thought, hate Elon Musk not because he's a racist. He's not, but because they can't control him. They hate him because he persists in saying things like this:  

So free speech is extremely important to civilization. Are you triggered by that? It's often hard to know who's on what side, so much lying. Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? Well, here's a very clear, simple and unerring test. Who are the tyrants? They're anyone who is bothered by the idea that other people might get to talk. That is an unfailing test. It's 100% accurate. Would you allow people who disagree with you to talk? If you wouldn't, you were a tyrant and tonight the tyrants are grieving.  

In Congress, Democrats made a last ditch bid to use their power to intimidate Elon Musk into backing off. Congresswoman Katherine Clark of Connecticut wrote this ""If they can afford to buy Twitter, they can afford to pay their fair share in taxes. Retweet if you're ready to support Joe Biden's billionaire minimum income tax."" But it's funny, didn't National Review write a bunch of pieces the other day saying it was wrong for Ron DeSantis to use his power in Florida to punish a company? I wonder if they're as upset about this. 

All of a sudden, Democrats are calling for any kind of higher taxes on the big companies that fund their campaigns. Why? Because here's one that may not fund their campaigns. Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman wrote this, ""If you can buy a major social media platform, you can pay your fair share in taxes. Tax. The Rich."" 

Haven't heard that from the left in a while. Why are they so mad? Because their monopoly on speech and information, the ability to control what you believe, has been broken. So once again, they're resorting to force to get you to shut up. This is not an attack on Elon Musk. They're not going to tax him into poverty. He's the world's richest man. This is an attack on you and your right to speak freely, to express your conscience in public. But for once, it's not working and the media are infuriated. They're profoundly threatened by a free internet and so they're panicked.

So Elon Musk is a threat to the weak, say the most privileged and powerful people in our society. Really? Are they really standing up for the weak? No, the weak are the people who aren't allowed to say what they really think. Those are the weak and what you just saw are the strong demanding the silence of the weak. Everyone's kind of figured this out, except the people demanding it. They're so up their own butts that you just heard them say that Twitter is a fiduciary duty to ignore its shareholders, block the deal and continues Twitter's decline in the market. It doesn't even make any sense and because it doesn't, you can be certain you were watching in meltdown and of course, at the bottom of the meltdown is always the same charge. ""He's a racist."" Wait for the New York Times piece telling you, ""Elon Musk is a racist."" 

Shaun King, the fake Black activist on Twitter, wrote this, ""At its root. Elon Musk wanting to purchase Twitter is not about left versus right. It's about White power. The man was raised in Apartheid by a White nationalist. He's upset that Twitter won't allow White nationalists to target, harass people. That's his definition of free speech."" So, you have a fake Black guy, attacking Elon Musk because of his parents, right?  

Musk hasn't responded point by point to all this and again, there's something a little bit pathetic if you care about democracy and pinning their hopes on one guy, but again, what are our options at this point? So far, Elon Musk has said all the right things.  

In a statement this afternoon, announcing his purchase of Twitter, he said this: ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated. I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential. I look forward to working with the company and the community viewers users to unlock it."" 

Now, if that's even half true, how is it not an improvement over what we currently have, where people are arbitrarily banned depending upon the whims of politicians in charge, where the powerful crush the week to maintain their power? If you think the status quo is better than that, then you're a tyrant.

Elon Musk bought Twitter yesterday with the promise to restore free speech to America and a lot of people were thrilled by that news. To them, it felt like liberation. 

Finally, they can say what they think out loud. They can participate in the life of their own country. They can be full citizens again. That's how they felt. But at the same time, a lot of other far more powerful people were not thrilled by this news. They were highly upset that Twitter will be lifting its speech restrictions.  

The ACLU warned that this was just way too much free speech and the NAACP strongly agreed with that. The Washington Post concurred, of course, but it took a different angle. It is terrifying, explained Jeff Bezos' personal newspaper, when billionaires start buying media outlets. MSNBC and CNN did not laugh at that claim. They amplified it and added some. It turns out that Elon Musk is a hardcore White supremacist. Who knew?  

Technically Elon Musk is an African American, but 2022 has been like that. You're always being surprised. So how do you make sense of all of this watching from home? Here you have one news story, but two diametrically opposed interpretations of the same story. So how do you determine who's right? Who are the good guys and who are the villains? 

We've been brooding about this all day and we have devised a simple test to answer that question. We're about to show you two images, both of them are famous. You've seen both of them before many times. They're both from the 1980s. Here's the first. Now get a pen and paper and record your reaction to it and remember, there are no right or wrong answers. Watch.  

So those last pictures, as you know, were from Berlin in the fall of 1989. Ask yourself, what did you see? Did you witness the triumph of the irrepressible human spirit over forces of totalitarian control? Or did you find yourself annoyed by the senseless vandalism of government infrastructure? Who did you sympathize with as you watched that video? Was it the protesters breaking down that hated wall? Or did you find yourself feeling for the prison guards in the background who are going to have a lot more trouble keeping track of people once the sensible barrier is removed? Be honest. Write down your answers.  

Now we're on to the second image. This one is from Beijing, China, same year, a few months earlier. So, what do you see here? There's a man standing alone in front of a tank. Is that man a hero risking his life for human rights? Or is he a hooligan impeding the progress of a government vehicle? Who do you sympathize with? The man or the tank? These may seem like easy questions, but that's only because those images are more than 30 years old. Everyone today supports the fall of the Berlin Wall and the freedom fighters in Tiananmen Square. But back in 1989, it was a mixed bag.  

Actually, a lot of highly respected people thought the Berlin Wall should stay up. That would include Margaret Thatcher and the president of France and a lot of others. Now, that may sound shocking to you, but really it's not so different from what we're witnessing now. Now, today, we're witnessing a lot of well-respected people who are arguing with a straight face that Twitter, one of our main avenues for solving political differences, should remain censored. They're telling you, again with a straight face, that you can't have a democracy where everyone is allowed to participate in the conversation. No, in order to represent the public, the public must be forced to shut up. That's what they're saying. 

So, whose side are you on – the man or the tank? Keep in mind that if you chose the tank, you were by definition a Stalinist. We're not judging, but we thought you should know that. The good news is you've got a lot of company. Here's MSNBC:

Oh, see if a billionaire controlled Twitter you could rig the discourse. That's a fair point. See, the thing about owning a social media company is you could, ""secretly ban one party's candidate."" Or even scarier than that, you could ""secretly turn down the reach of their stuff or turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not find out about it until after the election."" Yeah. That's a terrifying prospect. Democracy could not withstand that. Let's hope it never happens.  

What is it about cable television that completely eliminates people's self-awareness? Maybe NIH should do a study on that. It seems like a legitimate health crisis. 

We're being slightly unfair in that analysis. We do not mean certainly to suggest that it's only Democrats who favor censorship for political ends. Republican leaders support it, too. In a phone call reported today by The New York Times, for example, Congressman Kevin McCarthy of California told his close friend Liz Cheney that he hoped the social media companies would censor more conservative Republicans in Congress.  

Donald Trump, the sitting president, had already been silenced by those companies, but McCarthy wanted the tech oligarchs to do more to force disobedient lawmakers off the internet: ""Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too?"" 

Those are the tape recorded words of Congressman Kevin McCarthy, a man who in private, turns out, sounds like an MSNBC contributor. And yet, unless conservatives get their act together right away, Kevin McCarthy, or one of his highly liberal allies like Elise Stefanik, is very likely to be Speaker of the House in January.  

That would mean we will have a Republican Congress led by a puppet of the Democratic Party. So, you wouldn't know any of this unless it was leaked, and you can start to see why the people in charge oppose transparency and fervently support censorship on both sides. Why? Because the more you know about them, the less satisfied you're likely to become with their leadership. Here's the eunuch general of CNN's Praetorian Guard warning the peasants cannot have too much liberty.  

Oh, you're going to stay home. Actually, if you let people choose, you never know what they're going to do. 

For example, CNN just spent more than a quarter of $1,000,000,000 on a streaming service that in the end attracted 10,000 viewers. Right. Because people had a choice and that's not what they chose. So if you're a part of a company that made a decision like that, you'd be very much in favor of squelching the competition with censorship because if you didn't have a monopoly, you would wither and die. 

People would start asking questions like, why is equity so important again? Why do we care what TV personalities look like? Shouldn't we care about what they do? What they believe? About their characters? 

Over on ""The View,"" host Sunny Hostin is desperately hoping you will never be allowed to ask that question.  

On Twitter, it is predominantly straight, White men so when Elon Musk says, ""Wow, this is about free speech,"" it seems to me that it's about free speech of straight, White men.  

Elon Musk lives in a world in which the only kind of free speech is White men feeling free to say whatever the hell they want.  

Oh, now we can rebut those points and these people are obviously racists, and nobody says anything about it for some reason, but that's not really the big point. The big point—and we're going to restate it because it's the whole point is this: Anyone who was angered by the prospect of American citizens expressing their opinions is a Stalinist and should be feared. We no longer need to guess who those people are. They have conveniently self-identified. It's a clarifying moment, but it's also a little scary because at this point there is no going back. 

Once the kidnaper shows you his face, he can't release you. God knows what happens next.

The Biden administration has jumped off four paws into this, signaling it's going to use the weight of the federal government to crush Elon Musk because he wants you to speak freely. The day that Musk announced his intention to buy Twitter, the feds opened a probe into Tesla that would be his electric car company and the source of the wealth that made it possible for him to buy Twitter. At the same time, the Biden administration's allies in the media are uniting to defame Elon Musk and destroy him as a man because that's what they do. ""He's a racist."" They're about to do that to us again.  

The New York Times editorial board just published a stirring defense of censorship in a newspaper. On Twitter, the Times complained Musk will be free to, ""body-shame people."" He can also, ""poo-poo sound health regulations and shout down critics"" and that can't be allowed.

Thou shall not body-shame Tony Fauci. Tony Fauci is a very tall man. By the way, the vaccines work flawlessly. Not very subtle. CNBC was even less subtle, by the way, in its character assassinations. That channel granted anonymity to a source identified as ""close to some of the Democratic Party's biggest Silicon Valley mega-donors.""

What did this source come over to CNBC to say? ""Musk is a great engineer and businessman, but I would not trust him with my daughter."" Oh, she was a rapist now? Got it. Okay. No evidence whatsoever, but you should be afraid for your daughters because Elon Musk wants free speech. And NBC Nightly News, in between prostate health segments, strongly agrees with that. Watch them tell you that free speech endangers women way more than abortion clinics, TikTok and Teen Vogue. Watch. 

""Oh it's bad for women."" It's pretty funny. Oh, the rich, entitled ladies won't have a voice. Okay, but of course he will. Everyone will have a voice and that's what they're mad about. What they don't want is the coming of diversity, the one thing they say they love. There's no diversity at Twitter. As it stands, 99% of recent political donations from Twitter employees have gone to Democrats 99%—98.7, to be precise. 

How much is that? Well, for perspective Kim Jong Un got a much smaller level of support from workers at the central Pyongyang steel plant recently. 

So, 99% of anything is a bad sign. It's a terrifying level of conformity. It suggests brain death. But brain death is what they're demanding, and that tells you everything. As Elon Musk himself wrote today, ""The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all."" And it certainly does.

Good evening and welcome to ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" Happy Wednesday. It's depressing to say it out loud, but it's true. There's probably never been an institution in this country more thoroughly discredited than the field of ""public health"" is right now. 

At this point, it's almost impossible to take any of these people seriously and that is not a good thing. It's a bad thing. We need credible public health authorities, but we don't have them. In fact, after all we've seen, ask yourself, who would you be more likely to trust: some guy selling discount timeshares in Cabo? Or a self-described epidemiologist appearing on MSNBC? It's not even close.  

The timeshare guy might be sleazy. Obviously, he is, but is he the one who shut your kid's school down for two years for no reason? Is he the one who forced you to take untested drugs that you didn't want? Is he the one who demanded you stay home in fear, even as he applauded, unmasked BLM rioters, torching buildings in cities across America? No, he's not. The timeshare guy, whatever his obvious faults, didn't do any of that. The people in lab coats did it, and they were the exact people you were supposed to be able to trust, but you couldn't because they lied to you a lot, and they still are lying to you. Here's Tony Fauci from yesterday.  

We're out of the pandemic, says Fauci, and that means you are now free to transfer the hate that you once felt for your unvaccinated neighbors directly to Vladimir Putin and by the way, please do. Dr. Fauci's orders. Okay, thank you, but wait a second. Even if you're one of the many people who has recognized for many months that the coronavirus pandemic was indeed over, and who hasn't known that? Since when did Tony Fauci come to the same conclusion? 

Now, the tape you just saw is from yesterday. Okay, but it was just last week – days ago, that this very same Tony Fauci was scolding a federal judge for daring to end the airline mask mandate without his expressed permission. In other words, just days ago, this pandemic was raging – raging so intensely that you had to cover your insolent little face with a useless paper mask as a signifier of your terror and obedience. Those are the rules. Fauci demanded it. Watch.  

""No democracy here. This is public health. This is a CDC issue. Federal courts have no power. We'll tell you when you can have your freedoms back, peasant."" That's what Fauci just said and again, that was just last week and now suddenly this same guy tells us that the dreaded pandemic that ruled our lives for two full years is just gone. It disappeared without even a press release. It is buried in the distant past, stricken from polite conversation like a bad starter marriage.  

We can all pretend it never happened. That was Tony Fauci's position yesterday in that PBS interview and then today we awoke to sunny skies on the East Coast and a brand-new version of Tony Fauci because, in fact, Tony Fauci explained in yet another interview, this one to the Associated Press, that the coronavirus pandemic is not over. No, not at all. Instead, we're merely in what he called a ""different moment"" of the pandemic, but Fauci emphasized with total self-confidence, not a hint of self-awareness, ""by no means does that mean the pandemic is over."" Following this?  

So yesterday it was over. Today it's back on. That's America's public health establishment, making it up as they go along and yelling at you ceaselessly as they do and as they have for years. Remember this clip from December when Joe Biden informed you gravely that you probably weren't going to make it through the long winter? Merry Christmas, everyone.  

Severe illness and death for the unvaccinated. Ring around the rosie, all fall down. You're screwed, pal. Woah, five months later, look around, and honestly, it's hard to find a single pile of corpses in the street. What you see are a lot of perfectly healthy people who did not take the shot and at the same time, you notice an awful lot of vaccinated people died of COVID. What does that mean? Well, it's not a scientific study, but we can be pretty certain there was a lot of lying going on, quite a bit of overstatement that actually crossed the line into deception. 

Tony Fauci admitted as much to The New York Times back in December of 2020, at which point he should have been bounced out of his job and never heard from again. Speaking of timeshares, go to Cabo. Don't talk to us, but no. Here's what he said. Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goalposts as scientists do. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he thinks. We're finally ready. 

So based on his gut instinct, that's the science their lecturing us? His gut instinct? Again, that was in 2020, and we let this guy have full control of our purported democracy up until now when he's telling us one day there's a pandemic and the next day there isn't, and the next day there is. You didn't think you're ready to hear what he really thinks? ""We're not ready for Tony Fauci. We're not worthy."" You drive through Washington, D.C., the affluent areas in Northwest D.C., all these signs. ""We love you, Dr. Fauci. We worship you. You're our midget king."" Okay. So why is he changing his tune now?  

Well, midterm elections are approaching, and it turns out mask mandates and lockdowns aren't very popular, so we need to get rid of them, says the Democratic Party, but there's a problem. If we declare that the pandemic is actually over, then we can't really justify keeping Title 42. What's that? Well Title 42 is the public health regulation that allows border officials to turn away illegal aliens because they are a danger to the public health because they may have COVID, as many of them do and COVID officially is the scariest thing there is. So, you don't want anything scary associated with all these brave, new citizens who are going to vote faithfully for the Democratic Party. That's the idea. So, even the guy in charge of our border security has acknowledged that once Title 42 is gone, the border is going to be flooded with lots of new people moving north. Watch.  

So, we're already at the point where possibly 2 million foreign nationals, none of whom have a right at all to be in this country or use any of our services, probably shouldn't be here at a time when food and energy are getting scarce, because supply and demand is real. 

We've already had that. Massive. The largest wave of human migration into our country without authorization ever in our history, but you probably didn't notice it because it happened in dribs and drabs every single day and then these people were put on planes and flown to Westchester and you didn't see it, so you'll tolerate it, but if they drop Title 42, you're going to get a human wave and not from Mexico or El Salvador – that's already happened – from the rest of the world.  

If that were to happen, the Democrats would be in even deeper trouble than they already are. It probably would guarantee the end of their majority in the Senate, because unrestricted migration, illegal immigration, is about as popular as mask mandates. So, if you're asking yourself, how could Tony Fauci declare the pandemic over yesterday and back on today, maybe they're connected. Not a conspiracy now or anything, just throwing that out there, we'll let you decide.

650	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-nina-jankowicz-most-ridiculous-biden-ministry-information	2022-04-28 23:06:00	Tucker: Nina Jankowicz is the most ridiculous of all in Biden's Ministry of Truth | Fox News	" Fox News host gives take on the 'Ministry of Truth' leader on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

When Elon Musk first announced that he was buying Twitter, it was pretty obvious the Democratic Party would soon become unhinged, not just angry or annoyed in the way you're very used to, but instead legitimately terrified and hysterical. Imagine how you'd feel if an armed intruder broke into your home at 3 in the morning. You couldn't exactly know where things were going, but you'd be dead certain that everything was at stake. That's how Democrats feel right now, because, in fact, everything is at stake.  

Joe Biden cannot continue to control this country if you have free access to information. It's that simple. Biden certainly is not improving your life. He's not even trying to improve your life. So, the best he can do is lie to you and demand that you believe it, but to do that, he needs to make certain that nobody else can talk because if you were to hear the truth, you might not obey. How is Biden going to pull that off? It's not easy. Well, one option would be to get men with guns to tell you to shut up. Most Americans probably haven't thought of that because this isn't Africa or Eastern Europe. This is America and we don't do things like that here and never have. More precisely, we haven't until now, but now Joe Biden is president and everything is different.  

So today, to herald the coming of the new Soviet America, the administration announced its own Ministry of Truth. This will be called the Disinformation Governance Board. Laugh if you want, but just to show you, they're not kidding around here. This board is not part of the State Department or any other agency focused on foreign threats from abroad. No, the Disinformation Governance Board is part of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS is a law enforcement agency designed to police the United States and that, by the way, has a famously large stockpile of ammunition. So, it's not a joke at all. Here's DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.  

Oh, so one of America's top law enforcement officers just announces to the Congress that actually we're going to be policing what you say and everyone in the room kind of nods. ""Oh, yeah, it's totally normal."" But here's what he didn't say. So Mayorkas told us that disinformation is a threat to homeland security. Now he's the head of the Department of Homeland Security, so presumably he would know since assessing threats to Homeland Security is his job, but what he didn't tell us is how he's defining disinformation. 

So here we have this new and terrifying thing that the Biden administration is so concerned about that it's created a new agency to fight it, but Mayorkas never said or even hinted as to what it might be. So, the man in charge of the disinformation governing board never defined disinformation. It's almost unbelievable when you think about it. Would you declare war on a country you couldn't name? Would you sentence someone to death for a crime you couldn't describe? Of course, you wouldn't. Not if you were a sane and decent person because you can't have justice without precise definitions. That's why we have very large books of law that define what is allowed and what is not. But they're not defining the core concept at the heart of what is effectively a new law enforcement agency. Maybe that's because Mayorkas doesn't want justice, and neither does the president he serves. They want power and to get power, they plan to control what you think. Watch Mayorkas explain.  

Oh, did you know that? So, one of our biggest law enforcement agencies has men with guns around the country doing so many things to stop disinformation and false narratives. Those aren't even lies. They're just deviations from the approved script. Mayorkas told us again that men with guns planned to ""identify individuals who could be descending into violence."" Could be descending. Not people who've committed violence or even been accused of any crime at all. DHS is instead using law enforcement powers to identify and punish people who think the wrong things. That would be opponents of the Biden administration. Is this dystopian fiction? No. It's happening right in front of us.  

That means that Joe Biden's partisan political enemies are now officially enemies of the state. How is this happening in America? Good question, but it is happening and Biden's new thought-cop-in-chief has been revealed. She's a 33-year-old, highly self-confident young woman called Nina Jankowicz. 

Jankowicz comes from a place called the Wilson Center. That's a nonprofit named for America's other mentally incapacitated warmonger bigot president. Ironically, because everything is irony, the Wilson Center is itself a major producer of U.S. disinformation, but of the neocon variety, and for that reason is heavily funded by the Biden administration. Jankowicz is also, because everything is connected, a former adviser to the neoliberal government of Ukraine, the government we're shipping tens of billions of tax dollars to as our own economy swirls down the drain. So, you really can't make any of this up. It's too grotesque. Would you believe a novel with this plot? No, you wouldn't, but it's happening and that's the bad news.  

The good news is everyone involved in Joe Biden's new Ministry of Information is a buffoon. They may be evil, but they're also ridiculous. Nina Jankowicz is the most ridiculous of all. So you read about her appointment in The Washington Post this morning and immediately thought of the NKVD because why wouldn't you? Yet even the NKVD, even at the height of Stalin's purges, never did karaoke. They were too dignified for that, but Nina Jankowicz happily does. Here she is. 

This is the point of the show, we're going to say, we're kidding. We're making all this up. It's not really happening in the country you were born in, but it is happening. That's now a law enforcement official. It's also the person you just saw, an individual who brags about getting a master’s degree from Georgetown University. In case you're wondering if the entire academic credentialing machine that sustains America's ruling class is, in fact, a joke? Spoiler alert. Yes, it is a joke. This is somebody with so few useful skills that she describes herself in the first words of her own bio as an ""internationally recognized expert on disinformation,"" as if that's a job of some sort. Imagine if one of your kids grew up to be an internationally recognized expert on disinformation. The shame you would feel, the pain of knowing that truly and unequivocally, you had failed as a parent.  

After all those years of advanced education, Nina Jankowicz became an internationally recognized expert on disinformation and not only that, she can't even rhyme very well. What Nina Jankowicz can do, her one skill, the purpose for which she was hired, is level partisan attacks on the other side with maximum ferocity. That is her real job. Now, you may have noticed if you listen carefully to the ditty that she just sang that every example of disinformation in her karaoke performance came from people who opposed Joe Biden's policies. Is that a coincidence? Probably not. In fact, we know it's not because Nina Jankowicz is telling all the disinformation is on the other side of the political divide. Listen. 

You'd have to live in a self-awareness-free vacuum. You might even have to go to Georgetown University to utter a sentence like that. ""The right deals in this highly emotional rhetoric,"" says Nina Jankowicz. Now, it's worth noting here, because we can't resist that this very same Nina Jankowicz once wrote an entire book about how women can't use the Internet because it's just too upsetting for them. They're too fragile to read words they disagree with. It makes them faint.  

Here's a direct quote from Nina Jankowicz's book: ""To be a woman online is an inherently dangerous act."" Keep in mind, if you're a lady and you were to, I don't know, order UberEats, you're exposing yourself to danger. This is the same woman, Nina Jankowicz, telling you that it's the right that uses emotional rhetoric. Now, to be fair, Nina Jankowicz probably didn't expect a lot of people to read that in her book because no one read her book. It has a total of two reviews on Amazon, but we did read it. We'll get in a moment to what we found because it tells you exactly what we can expect from our new Ministry of Truth under Nina Jankowicz, but first, it's necessary to know a little more about this person.  

Now, she's not simply a hypocrite. She obviously is, whether she knows or not. She would be too dim to understand hypocrisy. What she really is, of course, is a hippie for the Democratic Party, and she's done that job flawlessly. Nina Jankowicz, the disinformation hunter, once called the Hunter Biden laptop story, which is entirely true, a ""Trump campaign product."" In October of 2020, she wrote ""Voters deserve the context, not a fairy tale, about a laptop repair shop."" 

Now, did she give us the context or any countervailing facts? Did she deliver the truth about the story? No, of course not. She just read a bunch of lies somebody handed to her on a card because she's a useful idiot and now she's a law enforcement official. Nina Jankowicz is repeating a lie that was, of course, widespread on the eve of the presidential election and when she repeated it, made it possible for Joe Biden to repeat it on the debate stage during a presidential debate. In case you've forgotten, here he is.  

Just to be clear, this is a nightmare unfolding in slow motion, but this is the point where we're just going to have to draw the line. No, Joe Biden, you can't have a federally funded Ministry of Truth and no, Nina Jankowicz can't run it. Period. It's not your country. You're not even compos mentis and you don't get to do this to a free people, period. This can't happen, and what is this? Well, if you want to know what's going to happen, look at what just did happen. 

Nina Jankowicz made it possible for a presidential candidate to lie from the debate stage about a story that may have changed the outcome of election, our election. Our presidential election, speaking of disinformation. She's never apologized for that. That's because a role has nothing to do with the truth or stopping disinformation. Her job is to restrict any speech that challenges Joe Biden or the Democratic Party. Now you'd think that would be illegal in this country as a federal employee, because we do have a First Amendment, but Nina Jankowicz doesn't believe in the First Amendment. 

As she wrote recently, ""The free speech versus censorship framing is a false dichotomy."" First of all, here's a pro-tip. Anyone who uses the term ""false dichotomy"" is a moron. That is one of countless academic phrases designed to prevent thought rather than facilitate it. False dichotomy means they're never going to have to explain why their position is correct or yours is wrong. That is dismissed with, ""Oh, it's a false dichotomy."" 

Again, that's an NPR phrase used by low-IQ people who for some reason want our country, all of a sudden. False dichotomy. Here's what's not false at all. Government censorship is banned by the First Amendment, the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights. This whole country is predicated on that, but according to Joe Biden's new minister of truth, the First Amendment no longer applies in this country because Russia and systemic racism. Watch.  

So we reached out to DHS, the law enforcement agency now in charge of policing speech about Nina Jankowicz and her plans to censor you from saying what you think is true, and they assured us that they weren't going to do that. They're going to focus on human smuggling and Russia propaganda on Ukraine. First of all, it's not their job to decide what you learn about the border or Russia or Ukraine. It's your job. You're an adult. You can read whatever you want, but of course it's not about that anyway.  

If you read Jankowicz's book, which we did, you will realize very quickly she was hired to police domestic social media use, period. ""I have hope we can change the norms by which our online ecosystem is governed,"" she wrote in a typically illiterate sentence. This is what our colleges are producing: morons who can't even write in English. Later in the book, she encourages women to go to law enforcement if they see something online they don't like on Twitter. She called that ""an important step in the normalization of women's treatment online."" 

It's hard to even believe our system produces people like this. She's an illiterate fascist. In another book, Jankowicz made it clear that she's not in favor of government regulation of social media when it allows conservatives to speak freely. So, she devotes an entire chapter to criticizing the country of Poland for establishing its own Ministry of Digital Affairs. Polish officials said their ministry was a way to, ""deal with rampant online censorship of conservatives and social networks,"" but she's against that. She's against the anti-censorship program. She's for censorship.  

She wrote that Poland is making a big mistake in pulling back censorship and we're quoting: ""Poland's nearsightedness is leaving it extremely vulnerable,"" she wrote, and the solution, she wrote back, is for the U.S. government to ""lead in regulating and conducting oversight"" of people who disagree with the Democratic Party on Twitter. So, the truth was never the goal. And we're quoting again: ""We are not even sure that facts can prevail over disinformation,"" Jankowicz wrote. We must first begin with addressing social media.  

Just to be totally clear, the means of the distribution of information are the key to their rule. It's all they have. They have nothing but that. If you knew what was actually going on, you wouldn't put up with this for a second, and they know that, and the Biden administration knew that Jankowicz wrote all of this. That's why they hired her. What you're seeing is a full-scale attack on free speech in a country that has been free for nearly 250 years and it's happening at the direction of the U.S. government through a law enforcement agency. 

We can reveal that Biden's Pentagon, another group with guns, awarded a $750,000 contract to a group called NewsGuard. Now, that contract is for misinformation fingerprints. NewsGuard is an organization that claims to fight ""misinformation,"" but in practice is a censorship organization. It targets anyone who challenges the people in power. 

NewsGuard is currently preparing a blacklist of sites that contradict the national security state's talking points on Ukraine and Russia. So this week, NewsGuard wrote a threatening email to the news site Grayzone, informing The Grayzone that they're spreading ""disinformation"" because they're not reading a script. So, here's how the editor of The Grayzone, Max Blumenthal, responded. He wrote this: ""Do you seriously expect us to grovel for approval from the same tentacle of the national security state and financial oligarchy that has rated CNN as a highly credible news source and whose board of advisors is a grotesque gallery of corporate propagandist spooks, documented liars and war criminals who've never faced a scintilla of accountability for their actions?"" 

Kind of overheated language. Is it true? Yeah. Every word of it. So, when Joe Biden's censors come, that's the way you respond. ""Hey, pal, up yours. You want some disinformation? Here you go.""

651	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-biden-embraced-neoliberalism-reminded-us-horrible	2022-04-29 22:43:00	Tucker: Biden embraced neoliberalism and reminded us that it's horrible | Fox News	"Fox News host explains how the U.S. is seeing the end of neoliberalism on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It was a year ago this month that Joe Biden promised to transform this country, change it more than any president had in over 100 years. He was going to create a new economy through what he called ""a once in a generation investment in America unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system."" 

Well, that's big. What would it cost? Well, more than $4 trillion.  

How much is that exactly? Well, it's more than twice the gross domestic product of the entire nation of Canada, and, of course, most other countries, too. At the Washington Post, they suggested that Joe Biden's promise marked ""the waning of the neoliberal era."" 

Now they describe neoliberalism as centrist liberalism, friendly to Wall Street, when, of course, it's not exactly that. Neoliberalism is looting with a smokescreen of race and gender politics so you won't notice that it happened. But the Post told us, ""Relax. Joe Biden's going to give us something even better, better than we've ever had. Think FDR and the New Deal but with no downside."" 

So that's what they were telling you a year ago, April 20, 2021. Fast-forward a year, and it's clear the Post got it just about half right. Neoliberalism has indeed waned under Joe Biden. It will not survive the Biden administration, but that's not because Joe Biden has rejected neoliberalism or found an alternative, something that will revolutionize America, like the interstate highway system. No.

It's because Joe Biden embraced neoliberalism and in so doing reminded the rest of us, tens of millions of Americans, that it's horrible, that neoliberalism serves the interests of virtually no one. It's a cover for the distribution of wealth, a distribution that has become more lopsided in our age than at any age ever. It is a shocking discredit to capitalism. It's not actually market capitalism. It's something controlled and grotesque.  

So anyone who thinks about this for about 30 seconds gets the point immediately. They don't want you to think about it, and that's why Biden did what they always do: Tried to divide the country along racial lines, make you hate your neighbor so you won't think about where the money is going. He did what Barack Obama did, but much less artfully. 

Here's Joe Biden warning us that the biggest threat to America is not the fact you can't afford groceries or that a tiny number of people is richer than anyone in human history. No, the real threat to you is White supremacy.  

""White supremacy."" 

He has no idea what he's even saying. He's just reading a script that's been around a long time, since at least Occupy Wall Street, a little over a decade ago. Neoliberal politicians and media outlets began ranting about race constantly around that time to get you to stop thinking about what they were actually doing and for a long time, it worked, but it can't work forever because it's not true. They've been telling you for a decade that White supremacy is the real threat, but if you read the news, you know that's probably not true.  

You've seen a lot of mass killings recently and none of them have been motivated by so-called White supremacy. It's a little bit more complicated than that. All of a sudden you see people attacked in race-based crimes, but it's not the storyline that they have approved. It looks exactly the opposite of what they've been telling you. Of course. 

A Black nationalist mowed down an entire parade full of Christmas celebrations in Wisconsin. Another killed a Capitol police officer just after Joe Biden took office and then recently on the New York City subway, an avowed Black nationalist opened fire in a crowded car and a BLM activist tried to assassinate a guy running for mayor in Kentucky.  

Again, it doesn't mean that the country has an epidemic of Black supremacy, but it does mean that the constant harping on race, dividing us by skin color, telling some people that they are hated by the country itself, has consequences. The Democratic Party has embraced a Wall Street approved theme, a talking point about White supremacy. And to this day, neoliberals are trying to salvage that, to convince, you know, it's really true and that's why Merrick Garland has never announced a probe into anything other than White supremacy. It's why General Mark Milley isn't reading books about anything other than White supremacy.

So, the talking point may be fake, but they're continuing to throw it at you.  

At this point, Joe Biden is not just inventing racial crimes and attributing them to millions of people who did nothing wrong. He's also inventing entire new genders, too, and this is another smokescreen. So first it was people should hate each other based on their skin color. Now it's let's leave the entire population wondering what a woman is. 

Here's Joe Biden defending something called trans senior citizens watch.  

""Ensuring that trans seniors live with dignity."" Well, who's against that? Nobody's against that. Everybody is for it, but people watching this might wonder, well, what about every other kind of senior? What about the rest of the population that has diminishing hopes of retiring with dignity and higher than ever chances of retiring in poverty? Yeah, that's not even addressed and still, they're pushing the story on you so you don't even have time to think about it.  

We now have a trans admiral. Well, the good news is people are rejecting this because it serves no one. It does not uplift anybody. It makes the population hate each other.

So, our leaders don't understand that. They don't understand that their ideas have been rejected by the population. Corporate media, which carries the ideas forward into the living rooms of America, doesn't understand it, either. But the reality may wake them up. You're seeing it happen again and again, the rejection of neoliberal ideas. Consider the collapse of CNN +. 

According to Axios, ""Executives bucketed CNN+'s potential audience into three groups with various models of overlap: 29 million CNN superfans, (they estimated) 24 million subscription video on demand fans, (If people want to pay more for anything) and 36 million global news consumers."" 

So, think about those numbers for a second. CNN convinced itself it had 29 million superfans. That's even less plausible than 81 million votes in a presidential election, and it turned out to be completely disconnected from reality. In the end, CNN+ got about 10,000 viewers. Why? Because people don't really want to pay to watch that c---, to be called bigots, or learn about trans senior citizens, and it has nothing to do with their lives, and they know for a fact it won't improve them.

So, what are they listening to? They're listening to people like Joe Rogan. Why? Not because of his political agenda, but because he's interesting and he's curious and he noticed the world changing all around him and he wants to know what the hell's going on and so does everyone else. And that's why Rogan gained millions of subscribers since CNN tried to have him fired a few months ago.  

At the same time, the company that employs Joe Rogan, the streaming service Spotify, had to and you may not have seen this story, offload the Obamas to whom they had paid millions and millions of dollars. Why? Because no one wanted to watch the Obamas either because they had nothing to say because they're banal. They're not interesting in any way. So take three steps back.

What are we watching here? We're watching the end of neoliberalism and its core plank, the thing it depends upon to survive, which is corporate control over media and hence your brain.  

They need to control what you think or you will reject them, but increasingly, they're not able to because censorship, thank God, is dying and we can credit to some great extent Elon Musk for that, the richest man in the world. He recently bought Twitter. Now, polls made it very clear that Americans support this. Why? Not because they want another billionaire owner of their media property, but because—and the Harvard Harris poll found this—a majority of Americans understand that Twitter was a force for censorship, a force for control over the population. 

And it turns out most people, since they live in this country and they're citizens, would like some say in how they're governed. So, they want to get their opinions out loud without being punished for it. Therefore, they're glad that Elon Musk is promising to end the censorship of Twitter. Why are people rejecting this? Well, part of the reason is that while Joe Biden was making a fool of himself going on about trans seniors, Americans are getting poorer and they feel it. There's no hiding it. Many Americans can barely afford to live in their own country. Watch.  

Oh, a food shortage. How many revolutions have been spurred by food shortages? Most of them and the food that is available is quickly becoming hard to afford for people. But the Biden administration barely acknowledges this. Their solution? Flood the country with 2 million new people. They may all be good people. It doesn't matter. The volume is what matters. More people, fewer resources. What does that look like? More shortages. Here's our own Bill Melugin:

Right. So, it's just supply and demand. If you're having a dinner party and you had just enough food for 12 people, but you invited 1,200 people, that would mean not everyone got to eat. Right. Competition for scarce resources like food and gasoline is a huge, huge problem, but there are other effects, by the way. While most people coming over the border are simply looking for a better life. They're good people, they want to work; some of them aren't good people, and they don't want to work. They want to sell fentanyl and they are. That means a lot more overdoses.  

  

So, it's just awful. People are dying and not just in San Francisco. 

Life expectancy, average life expectancy for American-born citizens is down. So, if there's any measure of failure, it's that.

And the truth is, it doesn't matter what Biden says or any of our political leaders say. You can say whatever you want, but people still live here and they still have eyes to see and if their lives are getting worse. They know that you're lying and that the beliefs you are selling are hollow and the core belief is neoliberalism. That's been completely discredited and killed by Joe Biden. If he's achieved anything as president, it's that.

652	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-inevitable-end-stage-russiagate	2022-05-02 23:10:00	Tucker: Ukraine war is maybe the inevitable end stage of Russiagate | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the real motivation behind U.S. involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here's a happy memory. By breakfast, really even brunch, on Election Day 2016,, virtually nobody in Washington, D.C. thought Donald Trump could win, and they didn't think that because the entire press corps had been telling them for months that Trump had, as they always put it, literally no chance—not even as an abstract, theoretical matter.  

This wasn't actually a race. In fact, come November 8th, you'll remember this. Donald Trump was going to be drowned by a towering blue tsunami and swept away forever, along with the rest of the Republican Party — the collaborators, anyway—and polling numbers seemed to confirm that this was going to happen and so, by the way, did the private betting markets. At least one of those markets had set the spread at 80-20 for Hillary Clinton that morning.  

In the end, of course, they were not only wrong, they were hilariously wrong. By midnight,  had won and a lot of highly educated, extremely well credentialed people suddenly looked ridiculous. Hillary Clinton herself was so shocked by the results that night that she refused to give a concession speech. She went to bed hoping it was just a dream. 

Now, you probably remember all of that very well, but it was what happened next in the days between the election and Thanksgiving that it turns out in a lot of ways was much more important.  

What happened during that period set the course for where we are right now. Where we are right now is speeding toward one of the great disasters in our history. So, the leaders of the Democratic Party couldn't, in effect, handle the outcome of the 2016 election. They snapped under the strain of it, under the crushed expectation. But rather than look inward and assess their own role in the disaster —"" What did we do wrong? Why did voters reject us?"" and other questions that emotionally mature adults might have asked — Democratic leaders instead immediately set out to find somebody else to blame for the election results. And soon they settled on Russia. 

Vladimir Putin got Donald Trump elected, they told us. Hillary Clinton said that repeatedly. Now, at first it was hard to take any of it very seriously. We tried, but there was no evidence it was true at all and so a rational person concluded the obvious. This was a childish psychological defense mechanism. It was not a factual claim and yet they kept saying it in the face of no evidence and over time they began acting on it like it was true. Then, even over more time, they paralyzed the entire federal government for years, fruitlessly trying to prove the core claims of Russiagate, but they never could because those claims weren't true. And yet, critically, they clung to those claims.  

They never stopped repeating the talking point. The Russian government, ""hacked our election."" That was Jen Psaki not long ago, saying it out loud like it were true. Now, here's the context. As she said that, Psaki was trying to explain why the Biden administration is, in effect, working to overthrow the Russian government right now and for once, Jen Psaki was telling the truth. That is why. Democrats have convinced themselves that Russia stole the presidency, which rightfully belonged to Hillary Clinton, and they mean it when they say it. And that's why they are taking us to war with Russia.  

Now, there are a lot of things going on here, a lot of threads as in any big story, but on some level, the core motivation is just that simple. Here's what we know it's not. We know the war in Ukraine is not about saving democracy. Please. We know it's not about protecting the sacred borders of a sovereign country. We know the Biden administration doesn't care about those principles because they run our country, and we see how they act. And we know for dead certain and this comes as sad news to a lot of Americans who are compassionate, but we know now that the war in Ukraine is certainly not about helping the Ukrainian people, those poor people. Many more Ukrainian civilians will die certainly, thanks to the Biden administration's policies.  

If you wanted to save Ukraine, its people, its infrastructure, its nation, you would push for a settlement now. You would have done it two months ago, but they're not doing that. They've rejected it out of hand. So that's not their goal, saving Ukraine, saving human lives. No, that's not their goal. Instead, the war in Ukraine is designed to cause regime change in Moscow. They want to topple the Russian government. That would be payback for the 2016 election. So, this is the logical, maybe the inevitable end stage of Russiagate. Now, we should have seen this coming because they said it out loud years ago. Here's Adam Schiff from two years ago, predicting it, saying it. Watch this.  

  

So, we arm Ukraine so we can fight Russia. Now, how many Americans (whatever you think of Putin, probably not much, justifiably. Probably don’t have a lot of interest in moving to Russia), but how many Americans then or now want to ""fight Russia?"" A very small group, but Adam Schiff said it out loud at the time in the House of Representatives. We don't arm Ukraine so we can help the Ukrainians. They're merely unfortunate pawns in all of this. We arm Ukraine so that we can punish Russia. Why? For stealing Hillary Clinton's coronation.  

If only we had taken Adam Schiff seriously, as he said it again, and again, and again. But now we can't help but take Adam Schiff seriously because he's one of the prime movers of this war. Adam Schiff spent this weekend in Eastern Europe checking on the progress of the war he has done so much to bring about. He traveled there with Nancy Pelosi and a number of other of the most conspiracy-minded Democrats in Congress. These are the Russiagate true believers seeing their theory come to fruition. That's what this is. Here's the group, Pelosi, Schiff and the rest, meeting with the president of Ukraine. 

  

: 

How did Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi wind up in charge of America's foreign policy as we stand on the cusp of a third world war? And why are Republicans supporting them? What happens when you put people with a demonstrated lack of boundaries or self-control or wisdom in charge of something as important as the fate of nations? Well, here's what happens. 

Watch as one after the other, the Democrats you just saw on tape, announce that this regime change is not nearly over. In fact, this war has just begun. Watch.  

That was Congressman Jason Crow, a confirmed buffoon, telling us that we are not in it to achieve a stalemate. ""We're?"" Really? Some of us were under the impression, based on their public statements, that we were defending the sovereignty of another country, Ukraine, that it's not up to us, it's up to the voters of Ukraine because Ukraine is a democracy, but here's Congressman Crow telling us we're not going to accept a ""stalemate."" We're in it to win it. We're going to win. We're here until we get victory. Well, that raises the obvious question. What is winning? What is victory? How do we know when we've won? Well, Jason Crow didn't tell us and neither, by the way, did Nancy Pelosi. She just said, we're going to keep sending weapons to Ukraine ""until the fight is done."" 

How did we get here exactly? Do you feel betrayed? If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Americans who put a Ukrainian flag pin on your lapel or put one in front of your house expressing solidarity with the poor, oppressed people of Ukraine, you probably didn't think you were signing up for this. Nancy Pelosi telling us we're in a war with a nucleararmed power with no clear end date. Seen that movie before? Oh, we just finished one after 20 years in Afghanistan. Will it look like that? This is an open-ended conflict, said Nancy Pelosi. Just like the war on terror and just in case you missed it, they all repeated that line. Here's your nightmare again. Adam Schiff in charge of the war against Russia. Watch.  

These people are playing dress-up. They have no idea what they're talking about, and they don't care. They get to pretend to be statesmen for a day. But when Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi— again people with a demonstrated years long record of being willing to say anything for personal power, anything to improve the fortunes of their political party—when they're standing up with a foreign head of state saying, ""Here's an open check, you fill in the number,"" you've got to wonder where this is going.  

We know where it could go. This is the most reckless foreign policy in our lifetimes, in American history. You are watching a group of decadent, in some cases senile leaders, casually dismiss the consequences of going to war with the nuclear-armed nation, dismiss the consequences of nuclear war, like it's not even worth thinking about, but it is worth thinking about. They tell us daily, Vladimir Putin is evil and insane and that may well be true. But this same man has threatened to use nuclear weapons against the United States and western Europe if this continues and why don't we believe him? You may have missed this. The New York Times didn't seem to have time to cover it, but here's Russia's foreign minister just last week, underscoring the point.  

He does not see it as an artificially inflated sense risk, says Lavrov. So, what they're saying is ""we will use nuclear weapons against you and your allies if you don't back off."" If, for example, this seems existential like you're trying to overthrow our government. It's hardly a defense of Russia to say that's a real possibility and has been for quite some time. So, it's two years ago that Vladimir Putin revised Russia's nuclear deterrent policy. 

Now the new policy allows Russia to use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional strike. That means some sort of non-nuclear provocation. Now, in March, Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, who sits on Russia's Security Council, reminded our country of this policy. He warned Joe Biden that Russia would indeed use nuclear weapons against the West in response to any ""act of aggression that is committed against Russia and its allies."" 

Now, what would that look like? Would it include helping to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of Russian troops? The Pentagon has admitted doing that. You don't have to be for Russia to see that as a pretty reckless act and not just doing it, but then bragging about it to NBC News. Where does that get us? We should find out. 

We do know that Putin has placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert and again, Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world and again, why wouldn't he use those weapons? They tell us daily he is evil and insane and he may well be a risk. Yeah, but no one in Washington seems worried in the slightest. In fact, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, who has clearly something to live for at this point, is now calling for a blank check, an open-ended conflict in Ukraine using the same legal justification that got us into Iraq for nearly 20 years. He wants an authorization to use military force. Watch.  

""Prior to World War II,"" says Adam Kinzinger. So last year, Adam Kinzinger was a guy who'd been redistricted out of his own district and was trolling for some kind of cable news contributor. The future looked grim for Adam Kinzinger. Now, Adam Kinzinger is on the Sunday shows every weekend doing his Winston Churchill imitation. So, you can see there's a built-in incentive for mediocre and intellectually limited members of Congress to play the war hawk. But you have to ask yourself: why, all of a sudden, is everybody talking about chemical and biological weapons?  

It was just a couple of weeks ago that Joe Biden, the United States, promised to respond ""in kind"" to the potential use of chemical weapons by Russia. In other words, United States would use its chemical weapons against the Russians if they used theirs against the Ukrainians. And then because you're supposed to admit that you have chemical weapons, Joe Biden's national security adviser, whose memory still works, walked it back and told us. ""Oh, no, no, the president misspoke"" just like he did when he told us this was a regime change war. We would never use chemical weapons, said Jake Sullivan, but for some reason, a lot of people in Washington, in both parties, are still talking a lot about the U.S. using chemical weapons in Russia. 

Here's one of the most limited members of Congress Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, widely regarded as a mouthpiece for the Intel agencies. Listen to what he says.  

  

So, stories like this give people like Michael McCaul a chance to give you a moral lecture on television, which is the whole appeal, but again, all of a sudden, you have sitting members of Congress with access to highlevel intelligence talking casually about using chemical weapons or nuclear weapons against a nuclear-armed state. 

So, it's not a defense of Russia. You don't have to believe Russia was justified in invading Ukraine. They weren't. It's not a defense of Putin to think to yourself, ""Hold on a second here. How did we get here? Talking about nuclear war on the Sunday shows. Should we be? Are we ready for that?"" 

It's clear no one in the Biden administration cares or is worried about it at all. The escalation continues at a remarkable pace, and you know that if you watch the money. We're continuing to shovel cash to the government of Ukraine, which just last year Democrats described as one of the most corrupt in the world, but whatever and we're sending money to Ukraine at levels that are astounding. 

Joe Biden signed off on a funding package in March for $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine. Then he sent an additional $1.3 billion in late April. Then he sent $350 million in February. He also said $800 million in March. In addition to all of that, Joe Biden has requested another $33 billion for Ukraine and that request includes funding for ""longer-range artillery"" of a heavier caliber than the howitzers we've already been sending there.  

In other words, we're sending artillery to Ukraine that could easily strike Russian territory and we're sending $33 billion to do it. Now, how much is $33 billion in a moment when Congress is writing checks for trillions? Well, to put it into context, $33 billion is more than double what the Biden administration spends protecting our national borders and that's just one check to Ukraine, but it's double the annual budget to protect our borders. The Biden administration, in fact its more than double, just requested $15 billion for the entire budget for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and just $8 billion for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  

So, we're spending twice on their borders what we spend on our own in one request in one week. How much is $33 billion? Well, it's more than we spend on Veterans Affairs every month taking care of our own veterans and the saddest point of all of this is it hasn't caused the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine, and no one's claiming that it will. It hasn't bankrupted Putin. It hasn't crippled the Russian economy. It certainly hurt our economy. 

What's going on here?  

Well, The Daily Mail is reporting that a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin, he's on the bad guy list right? No, because he met with the president's son in Moscow several times to discuss investment deals. So that oligarch, strangely, is being sanctioned by the U.K., but not by the Biden administration. The Biden administration, for all its bellicose talk about Russia decided not to sanction the one oligarch who's friends with the president's son.

Just to restate. This has nothing to do with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine does not have anything to do with Ukraine, The long-term fortunes of the country or the health and safety of its people. Ithas to do with a lot of other things.  

The Biden administration's request, for example, for Ukraine aid – didn't see this coming – includes a pathway to citizenship for Afghan refugees, their spouses and children. ""The secretary of Homeland Security in the secretary's discretion may adjust the status of an Afghan national to that of an individual lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" 

Oh, so in an aid package meant to defend the borders of another sovereign nation, we continue to degrade our own. Bet you didn't think defending Ukrainian democracy meant admitting tens, of thousands of more foreign nationals into this country overnight.

If you want to know why our leaders are determined to escalate this conflict, there's your answer. It means more power for them. It means revenge for the 2016 election, and if that means triggering a nuclear conflict between our nation and theirs, so be it.

653	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-roe-most-embarrassing-court-decision-handed-down-last-century	2022-05-03 22:44:00	Tucker: Roe is the most embarrassing court decision handed down in the last century | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the Supreme Court document leak pointing to an end to Roe v. Wade on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you listen carefully to the leaders of the Democratic Party — and we do  — you would think America was built on a single court decision from 1973. 

The very same people who consider the Bill of Rights a racist relic, quickly dismissed out of hand, those same people quickly become emotional as they describe the sublime beauty of Roe v. Wade. Yesterday, when a Democratic officeholder described the Roe decision as ""sacred"" and it's not an overstatement. For many Democrats, it is sacred. They will tell you and they mean it, that this country cannot continue. Without Roe, darkness will descend. America will revert to slavery and cannibalism and other varieties of Hobbesian misery so gruesome they're best left on described.  

Between a bright new tomorrow and the hell of ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" stands only Roe v. Wade. They're telling you that on channels right now across the spectrum. It's all pretty bewildering if you consider what Roe v. Wade actually is and that is true no matter what you think of abortion itself, whether you're strongly for legal abortion. The decision, as a decision, Roe v. Wade is a widely acknowledged joke. Moral questions aside, Roe is the most embarrassing court decision handed down in the last century. 

Every part of it, from its invented constitutional justification to its meaningless parameters, mocks the idea of sober jurisprudence. The point of the Supreme Court is to interpret the Constitution. Abortion is not mentioned or alluded to in the Constitution. Roe iss invented whole cloth, and if you don't believe it, reread it 49 years later. Go ahead and try it. It'll make you blush. 

The Roe decision turns out to be a period piece from the early 70s, like sideburns or the AMC Gremlin. It's the triumph of faddish political trends over the law. The fact that the decision was in fact shoddy and shameful is hardly a partisan opinion. In fact, plenty of Democrats, including a lot of ardent pro-choicers, have acknowledged that over the years because it's true and that would include, by the way, Joe Biden.  

Joe Biden has always supported legal abortion, but nine years after the Roe decision was handed down, he was still willing to admit it was indefensible as a legal decision. Pregnant women, Biden explained in 1982 as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, should not have ""the sole right to say what should happen"" to their unborn children, because, after all, no one creates children alone. It takes two people. That's obvious. 

In fact, Biden concluded Roe had gone ""too far."" And of course, it had gone too far. That was obvious then. It's obvious now. Then, as now, many Americans believe that abortion is murder. Many other Americans consider abortion a prerequisite to happiness.  

Now, those are unreconciled positions, but thankfully, in a democracy, we have a solution to quandaries like this, and it's called voting. If we don't like something in America, if we want to change it, we elect representatives to act on our behalf. If they do what we ask them to do, we reelect them. That's the reward. If they don't, we vote them out. That's the punishment. That's how our system works. For hundreds of years, we have used that system to resolve plenty of complex and thorny moral issues, not just abortion, many others, and it has worked well and that's why this has always been a stable country, because we get to rule ourselves.  

Roe v. Wade took that right away. In a single 1973 decision, the high court banned democracy from the debate over abortion. Justices prohibited the states from enacting abortion restrictions that their own citizens strongly preferred. That meant that going forward, Alabama would be required to have the same abortion laws as Massachusetts.

Now, some people loved this. Of course, people in Massachusetts loved it. People in Alabama hated it, but there was nothing anybody could do about it because the Supreme Court had cut voters out of the equation. And as a result of that, the issue of abortion was never resolved. Things are not resolved by fiat. They're only resolved by consent. That's the core idea in democracy, and it's true.  

So as a result of this short-circuiting of democracy, demands from the left forced it. As a result of that, for nearly 50 years, this issue has festered. It has given Americans yet another reason to dislike each other. It has divided the country and now, finally, after 49 years, voters might have their rightful say over what to do about abortion, as is their right. 

According to a piece last night in the blog Politico, the majority of justices on the Supreme Court are ready to overturn Roe. Justice Alito said so very clearly in a draft opinion you can read yourself because it's circulating on the internet.  

Now, we shouldn't be able to read that draft opinion. It's not for public consumption. A final official decision on Roe is supposed to be months away and yet an unnamed liberal operative short-circuited this ancient process, which has worked well for hundreds of years. This person leaked the opinion and not by accident. 

The point of leaking the opinion was to intimidate conservative justices into reversing course. Mob justice. Now, if you're shocked by that, you shouldn't be. Remember that it's not so different from what we saw this January when another unnamed liberal operative leaked the news that Justice Stephen Breyer was planning on retiring, and that news for Stephen Breyer to retire, which liberal operatives wanted him to do because he was a White man. So that was, in other words, another op, one of many we're now seeing in our country and as if to prove that within moments of this story breaking last night, a mob formed a flash mob at the Supreme Court. Watch. 

Well, the upside is they're not telling you ""it's your body, your choice."" Even these people couldn't pull that off with a straight face after forcing millions of Americans to inject an experimental drug against their will or be fired. Do you remember that? They can't claim you have bodily autonomy anymore because you demonstrably don't. Instead, they move to namecalling. You're a fascist if you disagree with them and they've been honing those talking points because they've been preparing for this moment for quite some time. 

The Supreme Court, everyone knows, is currently debating the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. Now, during oral arguments in this case in December, Justice Alito noted that, ""The fetus has an interest in having a life."" Now, that's true. But when he said that, plans for retaliation began. No one wanted Sam Alito to vote the wrong way and now those plans are underway.

And it's no exaggeration to say that once this stuff gets going, you don't know where it winds up. People could get hurt because of this leak. You'd hate to think that could happen and you'd hate even more to think anyone wanted that to happen, but people do and here they are.  

Aida Chavez works for The Nation. She's some kind of reporter. She just tweeted that it's, ""good"" that conservative justices and their families will ""have their lives threatened."" She's in favor of that. Over at Vox.com, Ian Millhiser added, ""Seriously, shout out to whoever the hero was within the Supreme Court who said, 'F-it! let's burn this place down.'"" Oh, we don't get what we want, we'll just burn it down. Government by tantrum. You've seen that before.  

Brian Fallon, the executive director of the thoroughly thuggish activist group Demand Justice (or Else), which is implied, said this ""Is a brave clerk taking this unprecedented step of leaking a draft opinion to warn the country what's coming in a last-ditch Hail Mary to see if the public response might cause the court to reconsider?""

Oh, the public response, like do what we want or will hurt you. Again, we've seen that before. Let's stop pretending. These are threats of violence, obviously. The CEO of Planned Parenthood is now calling on activists to storm state capitol buildings. Watch this.  

Oh, we're going to capture that rage? ""People get angry, and you wouldn't like us when we're angry."" What? Didn't we have a system? Didn't we have democratic norms we were supposed to observe? If you don't like something, isn't there a process for resolving that? Don't you elect people to see your will put into law? Not anymore. You just storm capitals. 

""But wait a second, says the attuned television viewer, ""Isn't storming capitals to thwart democracy an insurrection?"" Oh, no, only under certain circumstances. Not when the abortion people do it, not when they announced their plans on CNN. When that happens, that's a good thing.  

Already the leaders of the Democratic Party are vowing to use this draft decision as a pretext to eliminate the filibuster and pack the Supreme Court. Now, here's the best part: All of this is happening in the name of democracy, so that you will never have a chance to vote on something that matters to you like abortion. And by the way, it matters to you whether you're for it or against it, but so that you won't have a chance to ever vote on something like that, they're going to for democracy.

Here's a former U.S. attorney explaining to the conservative justices on the Supreme Court are, in fact, insurrectionists. 

Yeah, it's like overturning an election. I mean, you listen to something like that and there are like nine points you could make in response. Then you have to ask: either the person saying that is so stupid that he doesn't understand what he's saying or he's willing to say absolutely anything to stop the other side and that's, of course, what you're watching. These people aren't stupid. They're just dishonest. 

Now, the thread, the consistent note in all of these clips is that none of the people yammering about this draft opinion written by Sam Alito have actually read it and you know that because you don't even attempt to respond to the legal arguments, because legal arguments are immaterial, just as they were when the seven justices in 1973 produced Roe v. Wade. They didn't even consider really what the Constitution had to say about it because they didn't care. That's why it's an embarrassing decision. 

Instead of assessing what Alito wrote, they just accuse him of terrorism. Overturning precedent is an act of insurrection, says the former federal prosecutor on TV. Really? So, any Supreme Court decision must remain in place forever or else you're committing an act of insurrection.

Hmm, legal scholars out there, are there any Supreme Court decisions through the ages that were overturned and that we were happy were overturned? Yeah, probably quite a few. Plessy v. Ferguson, anyone? But it doesn't matter. The legal experts are screaming about fascism. They're telling you it's only a matter of time before the Supreme Court brings back segregation, if not slavery. Watch.  

""I see fascism down the line."" You know, it almost detracts from us to play you something like that, but that show is real ratings. People listen to someone like that who literally couldn't navigate a checkout scanner, telling you what the Supreme Court draft opinion might mean, despite the fact she's totally capable of reading it or anything else longer than a tweet. Whatever. She clearly didn't read what Alito wrote. 

Alito did, actually, by the way, anticipate this argument that if you do this, all kinds of other terrible things are going to happen. He said it right out loud. Here's what he wrote for all the people who will never read it and we're quoting: ""What is distinctive about abortion,"" wrote Alito, ""is its effect on what Roe termed potential life."" Abortion is, what he said, is a ""unique"" issue. ""To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right."" 

Oh, so, they're not trying to bring back slavery or legalize cannibalism or make it illegal for you to vote. What they're trying to do is allow you to vote on abortion. That's how dishonest these people are. If Roe v Wade goes away, you get to vote on abortion, and if you're a pro-lifer, that's good news. If you're a pro-choice activist, that's good news. Why wouldn't you want your democracy to function? You don't want to vote on it? You want some elderly person to tell you what to do? No, it's a democracy. You vote.

But no one on television is saying that. Instead, they're demagoguing. In their hysteria, in fact, they're nullifying all the general rules they've just concocted, which is gratifying to watch. They don't realize it, but it's fun to see it. At CNN, for example, which spent all last year telling you that men can get pregnant. ""Oh, yes, they can."" Suddenly they rediscovered the meaning of the word ""woman."" 

""Women are losing their rights."" Really? What percentage of college students at elite colleges are women? What percentage of first hires at big companies are women? ""Yeah, Women are losing their rights."" How many elections are determined by women? Hmm, let's see, all of them. Liars, stupid people 

And in fact, just to get back to the Constitution, which is the core question here, abortion does not appear there, nor has there ever been a right to abortion in this country.  

Now, if that bothers you, if you want a right to abortion, you can vote for it in the Congress. You could pass a constitutional amendment. If you actually supported democracy, that's what you would do, or call for your representatives to do, but so far, nobody has and in fact, we're moving in the other direction. Today, Joe Biden announced that democracy has been suspended. 

I can't remember the word, but we're going to piece together the sentence, and we're quoting ""the whims of the public"" no longer matter. Sorry, pal. They do matter. It's a democracy. Our whims matter; so do our beliefs. We get to vote on this stuff because that's our system. You're just passing through. You'll be gone soon. 

The rest of us get to decide how we're governed because we're a self-governing country. We're free people. Sorry.

654	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-why-is-everyone-mad-justice-alito	2022-05-04 22:42:00	Tucker: Why is everyone so mad at Justice Alito? | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on how Americans are reacting to the Supreme Court document leak suggesting the overturn of Roe v. Wade on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

 It's hard to think of a topic in American life that's more divisive than abortion. Abortion is in the news today, obviously, but most Americans, no matter where they stand on it or how passionately they feel about it, don't really want to talk about it because it's just too painful. So with that in mind, for once tonight, we're going to open this show with an issue that unites all of us and it's democracy.  

Everybody in America is for democracy. Democracy is the basis of our political system. Both parties support democracy strongly. They often say so and of course, the alternative to democracy is bad. It's tyranny and nobody is for that. So, it's heartening to learn that preserving democracy is the main idea, really the only idea, behind Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion on the Roe v. Wade decision. Virtually everyone in the country has heard about Alito's 98-page opinion since it was leaked on Monday night to Politico and yet, at the same time, for all the talking about it, almost nobody seems to have any idea what is in it. Nobody's actually read it.  

Partisans on television keep describing Sam Alito as a hater, somebody who just hates women and hates rights, a sadist whose only pleasure is extinguishing human freedom and happiness, both of which, of course, are predicated on abortion. That's what they're saying about Alito. Now, we're not familiar with Sam Alito's soul, so we can't confirm or deny this either way. But we can tell you, having actually read his opinion, that there is no hint of any of this in what he has written.  

In fact, there's not even an attack on abortion. He could be pro-choice, for all we know. Samuel Alito merely argues that Americans have the right to vote on how abortion is regulated and for nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade has prevented voters from doing that. It has taken that right from them. That's it. That's the sum total of the supposedly controversial opinion by Samuel Alito and if you don't believe it, here's how that opinion concludes: ""The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and the Casey decision abrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.""  

Now as a factual matter, not that facts seem to matter too much, but if you cared about them, you couldn't really argue with that claim, because the Constitution does not, in fact, prohibit American voters from banning abortion or for that matter, does not prohibit American voters from legalizing abortion because the U.S. Constitution doesn't mention abortion or allude to it in any way. And anyone who claims that it does, as the Roe decision claims, is lying to you. Read the document for yourself. It's online.  

So why exactly is everybody so mad at Samuel Alito? It's strange because what Alito is proposing here is the very definition of democracy. We've got a bitter disagreement, in this case, over abortion. Both sides have a case to make. They can take that case to the public. In the end, the public gets to decide who's right by voting on it. That's called self-government. Since when is that scary?  

Well, since one side decided that self-government is too risky and had to be eliminated. Now, they couldn't say this out loud, of course, because, as we told you, the alternative to democracy is tyranny and no one can be for tyranny. So instead, they played yet another word game, because that's always how it starts. They inverted the definition of the word ""democracy"" to mean exactly the opposite of what democracy has meant for thousands of years since Athens. In Washington at this point, the word ""democracy"" now means ""We're in charge of everything. Shut up."" That's almost exactly how they're defining democracy. 

This morning's Washington Post carried this headline, which, as usual, doesn't seem real, yet is real: ""In draft abortion ruling, Democrats see a court at odds with democracy"" Because letting people vote on things is now ""at odds with democracy?"" 

It's hard to believe anybody could say this with a straight face, but Joe Biden can say anything with a straight face. Just today, Biden declared that people who insist on voting for things are not only wrong, they're the single greatest threat facing the United States. People who still believe in yesterday's understanding of democracy, where they have power, are more dangerous, Joe Biden said, than al-Qaeda, the Weather Underground, even the Nazi Party. These people are terrorists, and you know what we do to terrorists? Watch.  

Everything about that is a lie. It’s hard to believe that's the president of the United States. Of course, it's not a decision, it's an opinion and that opinion says explicitly this reasoning applies only to Roe v. Wade and abortion, and it should not be construed as applying to anything else. It says that flat out. If you read it, you would know that. He didn't, clearly.

So, what he said is a lie, but here's the line that you should never forget and we're quoting, ""This MAGA crowd,"" (which is to say the tens of millions people who voted for Donald Trump) is really, we're quoting, ""the most extreme political organization that has existed in history."" 

In history, all human history, which is to say worse than Hitler, worse than Stalin, worse than Mao. It's hard to believe he's talking about tens of millions of American citizens, but he is. And you should know that no American president ever has talked about his own people like this or even considered talking about his own people like this. It is shocking that any president would and he just did and it's easy to see where it goes from here. What do you do to terrorists? Well, you know what you do. You kill them. It doesn't matter if they're American citizens. Barack Obama told us that. You just drone them. They're terrorists. Terrorist must die. So, you should pay close attention to what any president says from the podium, particularly when it's Joe Biden, and everything he says, he reads because he has no choice.  

What are we seeing? We're seeing a coordinated effort by the Joe Biden administration to recharacterize political dissent as terrorism. ""Disagree with us, you're al-Qaeda, you're Hitler."" So, to get people to accept this, they're not using rational arguments because there is no rational argument for this. It is the definition of tyranny, erasing democracy, replacing it with autocracy and force. So instead of convincing people, they're using what they always use, which is fear and hate. They're whipping people into a frenzy. Here's Kamala Harris.  

""How dare they?"" She squeaks, ""How dare they tell a woman what she can do with her own body?""

Well, amen to that. Where was this Kamala Harris a year ago when thousands of (yes) women were fired from their jobs and banished from society because they refused to submit to the other Kamala Harris' claim that she controlled their bodies, not them? They had no bodily autonomy. They had to take an experimental medicine that hurt a lot of them. That's true and by the way, since when did Kamala Harris believe in this thing we're calling ""women?"" Whatever happened to ""birthing people?"" They disappeared in a day, along with our concern for the Ukrainian civilian population. It turns out that women can now get pregnant. What?  

Yes, just women and if that sounds like transphobia to you, well, yeah. The old Kamala Harris told us again and again that is transphobia. She’s an ally of the trans community, but here she is denying the lived experience of trans and non-binary folks. For the record, that's ""folx"" to say nothing of the Latinx.  

What NYU Law School, they noticed, (They pay attention to the semantics. They're going to be lawyers.) they're calling out this Kamala Harris for her transparent transphobia, like literally. One student leader just announced to the entire student body that Justice Alito's opinion was racist. Of course, it was racist. That goes without saying. That's implied. But then added this important observation, and we're quoting ""Not just women get abortions! (Exclamation point, which means we really mean it) Acknowledge the experience of trans men, nonbinary people, other folks who have abortions."" 

Yeah. Take that Kamala Harris! Do even hear yourself, bigot? Lately, it seems like a lot of our anointed experts don't actually hear themselves. We're running little short on self-awareness and IQ points and here's the greatest example of the week. This is from PBS host, in other words, a journalist whose salary you help pay, Yamiche Alcindor. We're just going to read it and let you enjoy it. ""I'm in Mississippi outside the Jackson Women's Health Organization, the abortion clinic at the center of the SCOTUS case."" (So, she's on the scene) We're quoting again, ""While, conservatives are celebrating the possible end of Roe v. Wade, some women here tell me they feel 'gutted,' 'devastated', 'like someone has died'."" 

So, the ladies of the abortion clinic feel like ""someone has died."" It's like the Babylon Bee, but no, it's PBS and they don't even know they're saying it. That's what these people are like and no one's more like that than Elizabeth Warren.

Elizabeth Warren barely has control of herself on the best day, but on a day when people are talking about abortion, she loses control completely. Here she is.  

""I'm so angry, "" she says, her voice breaking. ""I've never heard you so angry, "" says the deeply sympathetic journalist. ""Much more angrier than I've ever been."" Of course, she is. Angry is what she is. Elizabeth Warren is angry full time. She's anger embodied and in that way, she is the perfect standardbearer for her party, the party of weak men and unhappy women, the party of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The hallmark? Irrational and enraged and also, by the way, dangerous because irrational, enraged people are, by definition, dangerous.

Now, the Twitter account Libs of TikTok, which they've been trying to pull off the internet because they show you what's actually happening out there, just posted this video of abortion enthusiasts calling for violence in the wake of the draft opinion. Watch this.

Weak man and unhappy women. That's the party right there and also, by the way, people who commit violence, but when they commit violence, it's not insurrection. It's not a threat to our democracy. It's just taking to the streets and expressing yourself, even if you set fires and rush into state legislatures, into capital buildings. Not insurrection because the new rules are if you agree with the regime, you can do whatever you want and if you don't, go to jail. 

And everybody knows this and that's why people who agree with the regime we're out last night causing mayhem and violence on the streets of Los Angeles. They were so upset that voters in other states, states they don't live in, might have the right to exercise democracy and vote on abortion that they attacked the police.  

What are we watching here? Well, we’re watching government by tantrum. It's what we've had for quite some time. You got to give these children what they want, or they scream and kick and bite. They go crazy. They're so angry, as Elizabeth Warren said. ""I've never seen you this angry."" ""I'm so angry.""  

But it's not just people burning things in the streets of L.A. who think this. This is the attitude up and down the food chain, from the people who torch Wendy's and go and, you know, loot the Apple Store, to the students at Yale Law School, which I think has sent more Supreme Court justices to the bench than any other school. 

Yale Law was a place people took very seriously. Now it's hard to. Students there deface school property with chalk to protest Alito's draft opinion. ""It's fascism,"" the students wrote, to allow people in the states to vote on something that affects them. It's fascism to allow people to vote on something! Right. 

So, you know how this works. They don't want to have an argument. They want you to shut up. This isn't a colloquy, it's a soliloquy. It's just them talking, no dissent allowed. You're talking is disinformation and if you persist in talking, they'll go after you. 

Dave Chappelle is a comedian, probably kind of liberal. Who knows what Dave Chappelle thinks about politics, but he has said some things that are unauthorized and as a result of that, he's under heavy round-the-clock security. So, he was doing a show last night in Los Angeles in the Hollywood Hills, just talking about stuff, when someone decided to assault him with a replica firearm. 

What do we learn from that? Dave Chappelle, who if anything is probably kind of liberal – he's hardly the biggest threat the regime faces. He's just a guy who wants to tell jokes and tell the truth, and someone physically knocks him down. No one is trying to convince Dave Chappelle he's wrong. They're trying to hurt him so he shuts up.

That's how they are. Get in their way and they sic their foot soldiers on you. That's democracy.

655	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-biden-plan-torque-up-fear	2022-05-05 22:16:00	Tucker: Biden's plan is to torque up the fear | Fox News	" Fox News host reflects on the left's response to the possible overturn of Roe v. Wade, the state of the Biden presidency, and gives his take on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

So, you can question whether Joe Biden actually got – what's the number? – 81 million votes in the last presidential election and actually later in the show, we will, but even if you accept that there actually were people who voted for Joe Biden voluntarily, it's hard to believe that many of them got anything like what they expected in return for their votes.  

Joe Biden, not to be dark about it, just to be honest, Joe Biden has turned out to be an unparalleled disaster. That's not an overstatement. In fact, it's a generous assessment. Our country has never seen anything like what Joe Biden has done. Barely 15 months into his first term as president, Joe Biden has crashed the stock market, provoked a food shortage, opened our borders to millions of illegal aliens, presided over historic rises in murder, inflation and drug ODs, as well as a corresponding plunge in overall life expectancy. And then, because all of that wasn't punitive enough for a country as racist as ours, he dragged the United States into an entirely pointless war with a nuclear-armed power on behalf of a corrupt foreign government that once bribed his drug-addicted son. That's all real. Joe Biden did all of that and those are the big easy-to-measure crimes he has committed.  

You spend virtually every night cataloging some of the rest: shuttered schools, permanent looting, Latin American levels of wealth inequality, tampons in the boy's bathroom, $7 a gallon gasoline, unprecedented race hatred, homelessness, mental illness, suicide. And above it all, across the Pacific Ocean, a Chinese government that's laughing out loud as we destroy ourselves for no reason. That's some of what Joe Biden has done so far. He promised a return to normal. He's delivered war and economic collapse. 

Joe Biden is old enough, unfortunately, that he'll almost never certainly be held accountable for any of what he's done, but his party should be. How will any Democrat outside West Hollywood ever get elected in this country again? In a fully functioning democracy, that would be an honest question. But Biden has a plan: Torque up the fear, ban complaining, criminalize the opposition. 

Just 24 hours ago, Joe Biden, the president of the United States, told us that people who don't support him are the single biggest security threat that faces this country, not al-Qaeda, not the Chinese military, not the Mexican drug cartels, not even Russia, which we are told daily is the wellspring of all evil. No, you. You're the biggest threat because you don't vote Democrat.  

As Joe Biden put it, ""This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" The most extreme! The worst, worse than the Klan, worse than the Nazis, worse than the anarchists who murdered an American president, worse than anyone ever! That's you. You're an existential threat to the country you were born in. It's hard to believe Joe Biden said that, but he did say it and, of course, some people believed him.  

Here's what the Supreme Court looks like tonight. You'll notice the riot-grade security fencing around the building. Why is it there? Well, it's there to protect the justices inside from the mobs that Joe Biden has incited with the demagoguery you just heard. Samuel Alito is a 72-year-old legal scholar whose views would have been considered ordinary, mainstream, maybe five years ago. Now, according to Joe Biden, he is a dangerous extremist. He's a member of a movement more threatening than any political movement in American history.

What's the result? Well, today Alito had to cancel a public appearance because there were too many threats on his life. Each one of those threats is, in fact, a threat to us and our country. 

You don't want to live in a country where Supreme Court justices cower in fear for their lives if they reach the wrong conclusions. That's the definition of a failed state. Turns out we have a Justice Department that exists to prevent things like this from happening. That's the whole point, but under Joe Biden, the DOJ is too beholden to the mob to say a word about it. You can't offend Antifa. They're a vital constituency. Here's the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appearing today to tell us what he's worried about most. Watch.  

Well, of course. The greatest threat is global warming, which, by the way, is racist like so many other weather patterns. That's what Merrick Garland is most afraid of tonight and of course, in order to fix global warming, which is existential, whatever that means, you're going to have to hand Merrick Garland and Joe Biden a lot more power over your life. Sorry, that's the only solution. Much more on that to come, but for now, here's what you should know.  

Merrick Garland didn't even mention the threats, the physical threats to this country's highest court, because those threats come from the left and therefore aren't really threats. See how that works? You're about to see more of it. A left-wing activist group has now published what it says are the home addresses of justices Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch: ""We must rise up to enforce accountability using a diversity of tactics,"" explains the group's website.  

A diversity of tactics? What are those? Well, you can imagine. They already include disrupting Catholic Church services, not a big deal, in order to change a Supreme Court decision. That's not an attack on democracy or anything. Merrick Garland is not concerned. Now, if someone were to vehemently criticize Oprah, that'd be different. We'd have to hold a press conference and call in the National Guard, but conservative Supreme Court justices, yeah, they deserve what they get and so, of course, under these conditions, violence is already beginning. 

Abortion lunatics just vandalized a church in Colorado. The same thing has happened to a pro-life counseling center in Portland. In Los Angeles, demonstrators threw rocks at cops for some reason. What did they have to do with it? Who knows? War on the system and they injured one of them, went to the hospital. 

Merrick Garland isn't worried about any of that. His fellow Democrats support that. They're calling for it. They long have. Here's Chuck Schumer from two years ago, threatening mob action if any Supreme Court justice were ever to get out of line. Watch this.  

""You will pay the price."" Really? These are people with lifetime appointments. So how exactly could they pay the price? We can't vote against them. What can we do? We can hurt them. We can harass their families. We can make it impossible to live in this country through threats of violence. ""You won't know what hit you,"" said the thug from New York. Apparently, they're about to learn what's going to hit them. 

Remember when liberals used to oppose violence? They did. Give peace a chance. It's hard to believe there was ever a time that that was true. Maybe they were just pretending. In any case, they're now for it. Violence is their religion, here and abroad. You're seeing it on display right in front of you, whether you've noticed or not in Eastern Europe.  

Rather than trying to save the civilian population of Eastern Europe, Joe Biden is pushing for a hot war against Russia. In fact, he's already engaged in a hot war against Russia and so are we, whether we knew it or not. 

The New York Times just ran this headline, ""U.S. intelligence is helping Ukraine kill Russian generals."" Oh, no big deal. According to the paper, ""The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that's allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who've died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials.""

So, they’re bragging about it and not just that. NBC News reports that Biden officials are also bragging about helping to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of Russian troops. And then tonight (sense a theme here?) the administration is saying out loud that actually it helped sink a Russian warship.  

Now, why are they doing this and more baffling, why are they taking credit for it in public? Why would you tell people you're doing that? There's only one reason, because you want war with Russia. Not a fake war, not a proxy war, but a real war with thousands of American troops, trillions wasted and many dead. That's what war is and war against nuclear-armed countries is hard to imagine. There's never been one. There's no reason to have a war like this. There doesn't need to be a war like this. We wouldn't be having one if Joe Biden didn't want one, but Biden wants it. He's doing this on purpose. We're not imagining that. He's telling us what he's doing. We're just ignoring him. Many Democrats are telling us what they're doing. Here's Biden ally, Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, saying so out loud on Fox on Monday. Watch.  

If they wrap this in the Senate with a Ukraine funding and a COVID funding, you guys okay with that? Congressman Moulton? 

Really? We're at war. Did you know that? Did they text you to let you know? Because wars tend to escalate and wars that are existential for one side in which the leader of a country feels he may die if he loses, tend to escalate very quickly, obviously. Seth Moulton isn't worried. It's just important that we win, he tells us. 

We? Really? Who's we? And important to whom exactly? Is there anyone outside Washington who wants a real war with nuclear-armed Russia? Who exactly is Seth Moulton talking about when he says ""we""? We were wondering, then we watched Biden.  

Yesterday, he traveled to Alabama and he visited the only constituency in America that longs for war with nuclear-armed Russia. That would be his donors. He toured a Lockheed Martin plant, and as he did, Biden boasted that we're sending so many weapons to Ukraine that mothers in the United States are naming their children after Lockheed Martin's missile systems. Watch.  

Hmm. It's a joke. Just a little joke about weapons systems. You know, it used to be when American presidents talked about killing people, the first thing they did was make certain it was absolutely justified. 

We'd been invaded, Pearl Harbor, 911. This is an entirely voluntary exercise and the second thing they did was attach some gravity to the idea of people dying, because when people die, it's sad. They leave behind spouses, parents, siblings and children. Death is sad. Acknowledge that. They don't joke about it. Joe Biden considers that an uplifting story. 

Joe Biden is demented and he's dangerous and so are the people who work for him. That's true. Sorry to say it out loud, but it's real. This country needs sane leadership and it needs it immediately. It can not come too soon. Pray the midterms are fair.

It's pretty hard to argue with people who are passive-aggressive. You may have tried it before. ""Why are you so angry?"" they scream. ""Stop being violent,"" they snarl as they punch you in the face. Passive-aggressive people are intent on dominating you, but they're too dishonest to admit it.  

Now, it's not an honorable style of attack, but it's very effective, mostly because it's so bewildering. The Democratic Party practices this. Democrats will never meet you on an open field of battle. Instead, they will sneak up behind you and knock you unconscious with a bag of sanctimony. This is the party of weak men and angry women, so passive aggression is their only mode of communication. If you've ever seen one of Jen Psaki's press conferences, you know exactly what we're talking about. 

We watched one of them yesterday, in fact. It was her last. Peter Doocy asked Psaki what the administration thinks of the fact that liberal groups have posted the home addresses of conservative Supreme Court justices on the internet. Now, why are they doing this? Well, it's obvious why they're doing it and no one denies why they're doing it. They're doing it in order to frighten those justices into changing their votes on Roe v. Wade. Now, that's illegal. It's very clearly a federal crime. It's also, by the way, the road to chaos and collapse. 

You can't allow angry mobs to make your country's laws. That's why we banned lynching, but Jen Psaki did not have a problem with this. People are understandably upset with Sam Alito's views, she said, so you shouldn't be surprised they want to express that concern in person by screaming at Sam Alito and his family. ""I don't have an official U.S. government position on where people should protest."" Really, Jen Psaki? Are those the rules now? How would you feel if angry protesters showed up outside, say, Michelle Obama's house?  

Of course, they'd be thrown into thumbscrews within minutes and charged with racism and you would applaud as they languished in jail. But conservative Supreme Court justices? No, that's a different story because conservative Supreme Court justices deserve it. That's Jen Psaki's position, but it is not, in fact, since we've been speaking of this topic, the official position of the U.S. government.  

No, according to 18 U.S, Code 1507, the official position of the U.S. government is you're not allowed to intimidate judges, period: ""Whoever with the intent of interfering with, obstructing or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness or court officer in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building, housing a court of the United States or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness or court officer, or with such intent, uses any sound truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence shall be fined or imprisoned.""  

So, it's very clearly a crime. Jen Psaki either didn't know this or far more likely didn't care because as far as the Biden administration is concerned, Justice Alito is responsible for the threats against his family. If you don't want to be targeted by a mob that don't write opinions, the mob doesn't like, dumbo. You did this to yourself. It's your fault we're hurting you.

That's always the position of passive-aggressive people and it's the position of the passive-aggressive party. So, we recognized it immediately because we watch this stuff for a living, and then we saw this, and it made us think. This ran on CNN this morning.  

Now, for days, we have assumed, based on quite a bit of evidence, that the main threat to Supreme Court justices right now and to our justice system itself comes from groups of activist liberals who are enraged by the idea that Roe v. Wade might be repealed. These are the people who are spray-painting churches and are putting Sam Alito's home address on the internet. They're the mob, and they're angry, and we know why they're angry. 

So, the whole thing made sense to us, but according to CNN, that's not what's happening. In fact, it's the opposite of what's happening. The real threat, CNN informed us this morning, comes not from people who are angry about Sam Alito's opinion, but from people who are happy about it. So, the ones who are celebrating what Sam Alito wrote are the ones who are the real danger to the Supreme Court. Watch. 

You got that? Law enforcement sources tell CNN the real threat here is the far right. The far-right? Fences are going up outside the Supreme Court because the far-right poses a threat. The far-right is the one you have to watch out for. They're the ones whose electronic communications you've got to "" monitor closely.""

And that makes sense. Now that Roe v. Wade may be going away, these people are going to want to bomb as many abortion clinics as they can and hurt as many Supreme Court justices as possible. After all, the Supreme Court may get rid of a law that they have hated for 50 years. So, you can see why they would be moved to violence against the Supreme Court. 

Now, our first response to this was to laugh. It seems too absurd to be real. How dumb do they think we are? And then we remembered what the President of the United States and his attorney general have been telling us for more than a year. They've been telling us that no matter what happens, no matter what it may look like, the people who did it didn't vote for us. Yeah. The people who didn't vote for us are the dangerous ones. It's always their fault. Watch.  

""Not al-Qaeda, White supremacy."" So, when we reviewed those tapes, it started to make sense. Like the Mongols and the Visigoths before them, these dreaded White supremacists have declared war on civilization, these Trump voters, and the evidence that is all around us. We've just ignored it because in some level, we don't want to know, but in retrospect, it was always right in front of us. You recall when Trump voters looted that Macy's in New York City. They couldn't help themselves. That's who they are. Then they torched a police precinct in Minneapolis, the very symbol of the law, they set it on fire. And then they burned a federal building in Portland, Oregon.  

In case you've forgotten what all of these right-wing attacks look like from White supremacists, here's what they did.  

So, you can see why they're putting up barriers in front of the Supreme Court. Those people are so happy with Sam Alito's opinion, they might start burning and looting again and of course, that would be consistent with the years-long reign of right-wing terror we've been living through because their thirst for anarchy and chaos is never sated. At one point, these Trump voters seceded from the United States. They set up their own nation of lawlessness, drugs and squalor and violence within the very city limits of Seattle, just like the Confederates of 1861, but with more weed and spray paint—right in the middle of Seattle. Talk about brazen, but that's who they are. That could happen in your town. 

No wonder America's abortionist community is cowering in fear tonight, and it gets worse. These MAGA people have so little respect for law and order, they think nothing of rushing into buildings, department stores, Walgreens, liquor stores, Foot Locker and just taking what they want. They steal armfuls of merchandise off the shelves and walk out the door like it's theirs and then purely to amuse themselves, they push strangers in front of trains and open fire on subway cars. They drive trucks through Christmas parades and beat elderly Asian women on the street. You can't control these people because they're beyond the reach of logic.  

They are so primitive and superstitious, they have come to believe they can defeat nature itself with magic amulets like cosmetics and women's clothing. They think they're shapeshifters who can change their physical form at will and just become something different. You're seeing one on your screen right now. 

People like this don't believe in history or science. They're barely literate, so they communicate instead in grunts and unintelligible sounds. Here's the leader, the chief of their tribe, speaking in a language only they can understand:

What did he just say? We don't know. You'd have to be a right supremacist MAGA person to understand. It's an esoteric language. These primitives adorn their bodies with fantastic decorations. They dress in costume. Some even push pieces of metal through their faces in order to look fierce. Look at them in their war paint.  

Margaret Mead wrote about people like this, antisocial elements that are a feature of any society, but in our case, the MAGA people number in the millions. You saw just a few on your screen and because there are so many, they threaten the very foundations of our civil society, just like Alejandro Mayorkas and the attorney general have warned us. They are so powerful that courts and legislators bow before their rage.  

Prosecutors can't even restrain them, but instead do their bidding. Why? Because they're afraid not to.

Do you remember what the MAGA people did to Minneapolis when a jury dared to convict their spiritual leader, Derek Chauvin? The MAGA people stormed the jail, freed Chauvin. They carried him on their shoulders back to their guerrilla camps in the mountains where they danced rampantly before bonfires made of back issues of the Atlantic magazine, howling into the night sky, and then, as an indelible lesson to the rest of us, they returned to the city of Minneapolis and sacked it because that's what they do when they don't agree with the jury decision, they riot.

That's what the MAGA people are like and that's why they're the greatest threat we face. Do you remember that moment? We saved the tape. Ladies and gentlemen, here are the MAGA people.  

We'd play more, but it's stomachturning. Ask Jen Psaki what it looked like. She's never recovered from it.

657	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-modern-liberals-hate-christianity-not-because-its-repressive-but-because-they-are	2022-05-09 22:35:00	Tucker: Modern liberals hate Christianity, not because it's repressive, but because they are | Fox News	"Fox News host reacts to churches being targeted after leaked documents suggest the overturn of Roe v. Wade on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

A week ago, exactly, an unnamed saboteur at the Supreme Court, leaked a draft opinion by Justice Sam Alito explaining why Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned. Now, people were completely hysterical over it, but actually, as a legal matter, Alito's views were not especially controversial. Roe is bad law.  

Over the past half-century, many have acknowledged that, including many pro-choice Democrats, including Joe Biden. So, at this point, 49 years in, if you're an office holder who supports legal abortion, the obvious solution is to vote for legal abortion, pass a law like they do in democracies. It's not complicated. That's how it's supposed to work. But Democrats have no interest in that. Democracy is a tiresome process, and worst of all, the outcome isn't always guaranteed. They prefer what they call direct action, not democracy.  

Liberal activists immediately set about threatening Supreme Court justices and then attacking Christianity. A group called Ruth Sent Us, which is named in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, posted the home addresses of every Supreme Court justice who is conservative. Why did they do this? Well, of course, to invite violence and harassment to get them to change their votes. Then Ruth Sent Us, sent this to practicing Catholics across the country, ""Stuff, your rosaries and your weaponized prayer. We will be burning the Eucharist to show our disgust for the abuse Catholic churches have condoned for centuries."" 

Now, you'd think the Biden administration might have something to say about this. It was all public. Joe Biden purports to be a Catholic. Intimidating judges, by the way, is a federal crime. But no. The Biden administration did not try and stop this. The Justice Department did nothing. In fact, from her podium at the White House, the president's publicist endorsed the coming harassment very clearly. ""The president's view is that there's a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people,"" Jen Psaki explained.  

The message of Joe Biden's abortion militia could not have been clearer: Go forth and terrorize. That's the word from the White House. So that's exactly what they did. Here's the mob this weekend outside Brett Kavanaugh's house. 

Brett Kavanaugh is a  justice, but he's also a man and a husband and a father, as you just saw. He lives in a pretty normal neighborhood outside D.C., doesn't have a wall around the house and more to the point, his two daughters are home. Imagine what it must have been like inside the house if you're Brett Kavanaugh or his wife or his daughters. The people outside didn't care. The woman who organized that protest outside Kavanaugh's house lives right down the street, apparently.  

She's a deeply unhappy individual called Lacie Wooten-Holway. Wooten-Holway brought the mob to Kavanaugh's house for a very specific reason, not because she was angry, which she is, but because she wants Brett Kavanaugh to change his views and support Roe v. Wade. She was intimidating a federal judge, all of the more, and once again, that's a federal crime. It could not be clearer. 

And yet, Lacie Wooten-Holway, who bragged about organizing this, was not arrested. She wasn't even scolded. Instead, she was rewarded. Lacie Wooten-Holway got a glowing profile in The Washington Post. So once again, in effect, our leaders in Washington sent a very clear message to the mob, as they did for BLM, ""Do what you want. We're on your side. It's not like you're insurrectionists.""

So, the mob did. Look at the mob did to this Christian counseling center in Wisconsin over the weekend.  

You're not safe. Now, the Christian counseling center had nothing to do with Samuel Alito's opinion, of course. The Christian counseling center only talks to women who are pregnant and aren't sure what to do next. They don't make money doing it. They're not Planned Parenthood. They're not getting rich by giving gender altering chemicals to your kids or committing abortion. No, they're just talking to girls who are confused and upset. Some of those girls wind up having abortions anyway, but the people at the Christian counseling center are trying their best to do their duty. They're not doing anything aggressive at all, but because their views are repugnant to the left, their building was firebombed.  

""You're not safe,"" said the fired bombers. Apparently, they aren't. 

How did the media cover this? Well, here's Politico, which is not even a news organization anymore. Here's how they described this fire bombing: ""A fire broke out Sunday at the office of an anti-abortion group in Madison, Wisconsin."" 

Oh, a fire broke out. Really? 

The Hill newspaper agreed, ""Fire breaks out at Wisconsin anti-abortion group office."" Oh, it just broke out. 

According to a police chief in Madison where it happened, ""the arson is not considered a terrorist incident."" So, firebombing with Molotov cocktails for political reasons, threats left on the wall in spray paint, definitely not terrorism. Let's call it activism, because, you know, a fire broke out.  

So, of course, fires will continue to break out, if that's your posture, and they are and more. Here's surveillance footage that we obtained of an attack on the Christian nonprofit Concerned Women for America. That's based in Alexandria, Virginia, right across the river from Washington. You can see them entering the intercom from the wall, exposing himself and a lot more. This just happened over the weekend in response to Sam Alito's opinion with which Concerned Women for America had nothing to do. They had no role in it whatsoever, but because they're Christians, they were attacked.

The FBI has been notified. Have arrests been made? No, it's not January 6th. No one stopped the person who did that and no one has stopped the thugs who terrorized Sunday masses yesterday either, across the country. This was the scene of the Sunday mass in Los Angeles.  

So among other things, sincerely, the religious people are a reviled minority at this point in the United States, and the Biden administration has made it its job, its self-described job, to protect unpopular minority groups. There's also, by the way, a federal law that makes intimidating churchgoers illegal. It's 18 U.S.C. 247, for the record.

But the Biden administration has no interest in particularly in protecting this particular reviled minority. They're ignoring the whole thing. That means that churches now need armed guards to protect themselves, but those guards are also now being targeted. Watch.  

So, you'd think that churches in Texas would be safe. After all, it's Texas, but no. St Bartholomew's Catholic Church in Katy, Texas, now reports that the tabernacle was just stolen last night, again likely in response to the Alito opinion And this was the scene outside the Basilica of Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on Saturday. Watch.  

""I'm killing the baby."" Could you get away with that outside any other religious center? Any other group of worshipers? Probably not. We wouldn't support it.

So, maybe you're starting to think this isn't actually about Roe. Maybe it's about something more than that. Maybe it's about something much darker than that.

Take a look what Democrats are doing in Congress right now, if you want a sense of what their plans are. This is a real passage from a new abortion bill the Democrats are trying to get through the Congress and we're quoting: ""This act is intended to protect all people with a capacity for pregnancy, cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, those who identify with a different gender and others."" 

So there it is. It's not really about codifying Roe – abortions for people who ""need them safe, legal and rare."" It's about something much bigger than that. It's about displacing God as the great decider. Democrats now reserve the right to rewrite biology, which is to say dominion over nature. Now they're in charge.

So again, this isn't just about intimidating Supreme Court justices, five of them, into changing their views on Roe v. Wade. It's about attacking Christianity because Christianity stands in their way. MSNBC just comes out and says it. Watch.  

  

So, they're mad, not really just at Alito, but at Christianity and Christians, believers, people of faith. They have been for a long time, but it's weird if you think about it. Why are liberals angry at Christianity? You wouldn't think they would be. Christianity has been the single greatest force for human rights in history. In fact, the Western understanding of human rights, our understanding of human rights, all of us, atheists included, is based on Christianity. That's where it comes from. Christianity is the reason we don't have slavery and segregation and children working in factories. Christians did that.  

So, if you're a sincere liberal, it would seem odd to hate Christians. But the totalitarians always do hate Christians. The Soviets killed the priests first, so did Mao. During the Spanish Civil War, the Communists subjected a statue of Jesus to a symbolic execution in front of a firing squad. It was one of the first things they did within weeks of the war breaking out. Here's the picture on your screen. Shooting Jesus. It tells you everything.  

Modern liberals hate Christianity, not because it's repressive, but because they are. Any religion that puts God before government is by definition a threat to their power. Most offensive of all, Christianity specifically rejects their most cherished dogma, which is racial hierarchy. The Christian message is the opposite of the equity agenda.  

Christianity describes a universal brotherhood of man, every person created in God's image and therefore, for that reason, morally equal. That is gravely disempowering for the left. If all people are morally equal, you can't really divide your population by skin color. You can't really set one group against another. You can't tell one group you're better than that group, you're worse than that group. That's not allowed. So, in order to allow it, you have to erase Christianity, and they've been working on it for a long time.  

Ever notice how they call Martin Luther King, ""Dr."", but not ""Reverend""? King was not a physician. He was a Christian preacher. They'd like you to forget that. Undermining Christianity is the central project of the left because it stands in their way. As dozens of churches burned across Canada last summer, the country's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, refused to condemn the firebombing. He called them ""understandable."" Then the head of Canada's ACLU effectively endorsed the fire bombings. ""Burn it all down,"" she wrote.

And now we're seeing it happen here as we knew it would.

658	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-karine-jean-pierre-furious-america-despite-ample-privilege	2022-05-10 22:38:00	Tucker: Karine Jean-Pierre is furious at America, despite her ample privilege | Fox News	"Fox News host gives his take on the president's new pick for press secretary on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

So, if you're the White House press secretary – and thank God you're not – but if you were, you would have two tasks every day. You've got to learn the president's views on what's happening in the world so you can repeat them, and then you've got to try to remember the names of those weird-looking people sitting in the folding chairs in the briefing room. 

So, it's not an easy job, but it's not a very rewarding one, either. You're not making policy. You're not making decisions. You're repeating the party line. 

Under normal circumstances, it takes a lot more creativity to, say, sell lipstick for L'Oreal than it does to be White House press secretary. They're all worn out by the end, except under Joe Biden. It's a totally different job under Joe Biden. The rules have changed. If you're Joe Biden's press secretary, you've got to be able to think on the fly because your boss can't. So, every time Biden goes outside, you're going to be called upon to translate what he said or explain what he really meant, assuming for the sake of argument that he really meant anything at all.  

""I know you're frustrated,"" Biden said today, for example. ""I can taste it."" What does frustration taste like? An earthy, slightly unctuous blend of bacon notes, mango, and raspberry with an undertone of saddle leather? Maybe. Joe Biden didn't say. The White House press secretary would know. That's her job. 

Well, to name another example, which United States senators represent the state of Florida and which represent the state of Wisconsin, which is not near Florida. Well, the press secretary would have to know that, too, in case Biden screws it up as, of course, he just did today, etc.

 It's not an easy gig, and it's a particularly tough job when the topics are serious, like nuclear war.  

A few weeks ago, Joe Biden pledged to overthrow the government of Russia, which is fully capable of waging nuclear war, possessing, as it does, at least 6,000 nuclear warheads. That's not a small thing, starting a global conflagration and ending human life on the planet. So, it fell to the press secretary to clean it up. ""We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or regime change,"" Jen Psaki explained, despite the fact that Joe Biden had just advocated for regime change in Russia.

So, it's a lot of power. How did somebody like Jen Psaki – someone so demonstrably talentless, a humorless gender studies major from Greenwich – how did this person get this much authority in our government? Good question. Nowadays it just comes with the job of press secretary. 

Just hours ago, Psaki explained that federal law no longer applies to mobs of Biden voters. They get to intimidate all the Supreme Court justices they want as long as they're on the right side of abortion and we're quoting now, ""We certainly continue to encourage protests outside judges' home,"" she said, and in so saying, reversed hundreds of years of policy and tradition and took yet another blow against civilization and decency.  

She could do that because she's the press secretary. She's Jen Psaki –  or was. Next week she's headed to MSNBC for a new life as a cable news contributor. Wish her luck, of course. Good luck, Jen Psaki. But in the meantime, you've got to wonder who's going to replace her. Who could replace her? Is anyone qualified? Is there another person in this country as shallow, nasty, and partisan as Jen Psaki is? Well, there is. Her name is Karine Jean-Pierre. Listen to Jen Psaki describe Karine Jean-Pierre.  

Well, you heard it from Jen Psaki. She's going to be the first ""out LGBTQ+ person to be White House press secretary"" and thank God.

But before you light a candle and begin tonight's celebrations, a quick question: What does LGBTQ+ mean? Hey, Jen Psaki, let us know if you have a minute. Explain every letter in that acronym and specifically what it signifies. We will wait. Don't hold your breath. She's not going to do it because like everybody else who uses that phrase, Jen Psaki literally has no idea, no clue at all what it means.  

It's one of those terms you're not supposed to define. One day to start using it: LGBTQ+, and anyone who asks what it means is immediately presumed to be in the out group. It's not actually a word. Words are meant to signify meaning and communicate it to other people. No, it's not that at all. It's a litmus test, and you could feel it. ""Oh, you don't know what LGBTQ+ means? Keep an eye on that person. Hates gays."" 

But whatever. Don't ask questions. Karine Jean-Pierre is our first out LGBTQ+ White House press secretary, and that's all you need to know. It's a good thing. Shut up and celebrate.  

That's why she got the job. She's in the right group, and to the Biden administration, which thinks exclusively in terms of groups and never in terms of individuals, because individuals are messy and inconvenient, the group is all that matters. This is exactly how they pick Supreme Court justices or vice presidents or members of the Federal Reserve Board and now, the all-important press secretary gig has gone to someone on the basis of group. It's really simple. Show us your picture, and we'll tell you if you're qualified for the job.

And in many ways, Karine Jean-Pierre is perfect for the job. Not only is she a member of the out LGBTQ+ community, she's also critically the product of a private school and an Ivy League college and yet still oppressed somehow. She is furious at America, despite her ample privilege, and enraged by its racist systems of oppression, and she's happy to tell you about it. Here she is.  

""Yeah, they keep electing Obama and promoting me, despite the fact I have no qualifications for the job."" Lesson, it's a racist country. Now there's a word for this, kind of a clever term, it's called ""cry-bullying."" ""Stop hitting me,"" they say, as they punch you in the face. Why do they do it? Well, they do it because it works. You whine about racism and you get into the best schools. You get promoted and eventually you run the federal government and your presence atop the food chain is nothing, if not evidence, that the country is still racist. It has to be or you can't justify your job. 

Kind of an amazing scam people like Karine Jean-Pierre have going. She's perfected it. She used to work for MSNBC. She knows the script cold.

Here she is in 2020, yelling some more about racism. Now, if you imagine that COVID came from a lab in Wuhan, which, by the way is true, then according to Karine Jean-Pierre, you're not a person trying to get to the truth. No. Can you guess what you are? You're racist.  

When you look at Fox News, Fox News was racist before coronavirus. They are racist during the coronavirus. FOX News will be racist after the coronavirus. There is nothing new here.  

So criticizing the Chinese government, the most powerful organization in the world, is racist? Of course, criticizing the powerful is always racist. America itself is racist. Talking about COVID is racist. What isn't racist? Well, we checked Karine Jean-Pierre's Twitter feed to find out what isn't racist. Couldn't find much, but we did find a very long list of things that are.  

Here is a non-exhaustive sample that we compiled of racist people and things, according to Joe Biden's news press secretary. John Cornyn is racist. Joe Arpaio is racist. Border walls, needless to say, are racist. Roseanne Barr for some reason is racist. The name Pocahontas is racist, despite the fact it was an actual American Indian's real name. Whatever, it's racist. Mike Huckabee may seem nice, but he's racist.

Federal government shutdowns don't seem like they have anything to do with race, but oh, they're racist, too. Donald Trump, racist. That's a no brainer. You knew that. Jeff Sessions? Also, racist. Brexit? Again, not connected to race, doesn't mean it's not racist. It is, according to Karine Jean-Pierre.  

Ed Gillespie, former Senate candidate in Virginia, racist. Thank God he didn't win. Ron DeSantis did win in Florida and that's bad news because guess what he is? Racist. Steve Bannon? Racist. Sebastian Gorka? Racist. And you know who is most racist of all? Republicans who criticized Ralph Northam for wearing blackface in a Klan outfit. You're racist if you notice racism, as long as the racist is a Democrat.

Oh, so awesome. Give that girl a big job.  

Now, you may be rolling your eyes because you've heard all of this a million times before. Ice cream and Shakespeare are racist. But think about it for a second. This is the person the Biden administration hired to tell the rest of us what Joe Biden really means when he says, for example, he's going to kill Vladimir Putin. How long until this person calls Putin a racist? Oh, she probably already has. How is that going to turn out in the middle of a war?

We might not have to wait long to find out. Here's yet another incredibly racist thing, according to America's new press secretary. Of course, it is voter identification laws. Now, you will find voter ID laws in every country on the planet, including in Africa, but that doesn't make them any less racist.  

""Well, it's pure racism."" Now you honestly didn't think, we started the show saying, could you find someone more grating, dumber, more aggressive than Jen Psaki, who's headed off to MSNBC next week? And the answer is, oh, yeah. The Biden administration can find someone even worse. That's their job.

And just to restate, voter ID laws are racist, according to Karine Jean-Pierre and if you have them, you don't have a fair election. And we're quoting: ""Reminder,"" she wrote, ""Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams."" She wrote that in April of 2020.  

She said something similar four years before, in 2016. We're quoting again: ""Stolen emails, stolen drone (Stolen drone?), stolen election. Welcome to the world of #unpresidented Trump."" if we're even pronouncing that correctly, but take three steps back. She used the term ""stolen election."" She questioned voting integrity. She engaged in a baseless conspiracy theory. Yes, friend, she did and you know what that is? 

We know because we read The Atlantic magazine. What you just heard is a brazen attack on our democracy. It is a disqualifying assault on our norms, our sacred norms. It looks, ladies and gentlemen, like Karine Jean-Pierre is an insurrectionist, a coup enthusiast likely funded by Vladimir Putin himself. Better call the DOJ and get her an ankle monitor.

Just kidding. We take it back. We didn't mean to question Karine Jean-Pierre – because that's the most racist thing of all.

They say it all the time, usually without looking up from their iPhones, but you can tell they don't really mean it. They don't seem sincere.

And then one Christmas morning, confirmation. You discover they've forgotten to buy you presents, any presents. They were busy and it just slipped their mind. Instead, they spent all their time and all their money buying gifts for a kid down the street. All the things that you asked for, they gave to another nine-year-old you have never met. How would that make you feel?  

Well, you would be crushed, but you would also be vindicated. You would know for a dead certain fact that your parents really didn't love you. They're not even very interested in you. That's how a lot of Americans felt last night watching the House of Representatives approve yet another massive aid package for Ukraine. Nothing against Ukraine, but we could probably use that money here right about now. After 100 years of virtually uninterrupted wealth generation, the American economy appears to be faltering in ways that are scary to anyone who's paying attention.  

Even people who aren't paying attention can sense there's something really wrong. Lots of people are not working. Those who are working are getting poorer quickly, thanks to inflation. All of a sudden everything is wildly more expensive. Have you noticed? We literally have a shortage of baby formula right now. Did you think that would happen in America ever? And yet it is happening and so is the deadliest drug epidemic in our history.  

About 107,000 of your fellow Americans, most of them young people who should have had long, productive lives are instead dead. They've died from drug ODs over the past year. This is the saddest thing that has happened to our country in a very long time, and yet Congress, which claims to run the country, can't be bothered even to acknowledge it, much less do anything about it. 

Instead, your representatives in Washington just voted to send yet another $40 billion to Ukrainian oligarchs who paid off the president's son. That's what happened, and it's just the latest check that Congress has cut them. You can add it to the approximately $14 billion they've already spent on Ukraine. That brings the total as of tonight to more than $54 billion. 

How much is that? Well, for perspective, it is more than we spent per year on average on the war in Afghanistan, a war that began with a direct attack on the United States. $54 billion – that's about as much as Russia, the country, spends on its entire armed forces over the course of a full year. It is a ludicrous amount and yet Congress happily approved it. In fact, they allocated $7 billion more than Joe Biden asked for. That's how excited they were to do it. 

Where is this money going? Oh, that's the best part.  

Congress has decided to fix all of the pressing problems that need to be fixed except fix them in Ukraine, not here. The main course of all this funding from day one has been to secure Ukraine's borders because, you know, you can't have a country without borders. They have to be secure. Nancy Pelosi strongly believes that about Ukraine and so do her friends on the Republican side. Ukrainian border security is the main goal. 

Then there's the problem of ""food insecurity."" Not here, in Ukraine. Food is getting expensive in Ukraine, so we're going to spend $760 million to fix that just in this check and not just in Ukraine. Congress, who was feeling kind of sporty, also added $150 million for something called the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program because while we're feeding Ukraine, why not feed the rest of the world? We've got more food than we can use. And of course, that will obviously include baby formula, too, because kids in other countries need to eat.  

Then there's another huge chunk of cash to ""combat human trafficking."" Now, not combat human trafficking in Texas, where it is now ubiquitous thanks to the open border with Mexico, but to combat human trafficking in Ukraine, because it's sad what's happening there. But not here, that's not sad. We're ignoring it. There's still more money to make sure Ukrainians have emergency shelter because apparently more than a million Americans aren't homeless tonight. There's $900 million to make sure Ukrainians have access to ""entitlement programs"" our entitlement programs. They'll need them when they arrive here, as many will.  

In other words, you can't afford to fill your truck, but you now get to pay the living expenses of anyone who shows up in your country claiming to be from Ukraine and you will. And then because paying off your friends is always the real point of these exercises in Washington, there are billions more dollars for Lloyd Austin's former employers in the weapons business. That would include $72 million for something the bill describes as ""research, development, test, and evaluation in Ukraine."" Hmm.

Now, don't say biolabs because that's not a lab, but honestly, this is weird. Ukraine is a war zone and therefore probably not a great place for scientific research right now, but whatever. We're funding some kind of science experiments in Ukraine. No more questions from you. And the bill goes on like this and on and on.  

As Congressman Thomas Massie has pointed out, Congress has now spent more money on Ukraine in six months than the U.S. government spent on all roads and all bridges in the United States over all of last year. The $40 billion we're sending to Ukraine so they can secure their borders, by the way, is more than double (More than double!) what Joe Biden has asked to fund Customs and Border Security in the United States. One bill, more than double what we're spending this year on our borders and then in the middle of this historic drug emergency, and it is, the bill spends more than ten times the entire budget of the DEA (More than ten times!). Just in case you're wondering how your leaders feel about you, they're not fans at all, and now we know for sure.  

You should know that every single Democrat in the House of Representatives voted for this bill. That would include even Barbara Lee of Berkeley. Now, if you remember her name, it may be because in 2001, Barbara Lee of Berkeley was the only member of Congress to oppose the war against the Taliban. But a war in Ukraine is a war that Barbara Lee can support. Why? Because there's no potential chance that war could help the United States. Here's her reasoning.  

So it's not really about Ukraine. It's about something bigger than Ukraine. Thanks, Barbara Lee, for being dim enough to tell us that, to say it out loud. This is a war on disinformation, which at some point in some way is dead certain to be a war on you. No question about it, because you're a font of disinformation, meaning you disagree. But we know for certain that wars against things you can't really identify, against people who don't exist, wars against concepts, one thing we know about those wars, like the war on terror, is they last forever.  

So it's a little weird to see Tim Ryan of Ohio vote for this. Tim Ryan was supposed to be a working man's Democrat, a guy who cares about bread-and-butter issues. Tim Ryan represents Youngstown and Akron. Take a look at Akron some time. It's like a war zone itself. These are the cities that built America, crumbling and desperate now from total neglect. But don't you worry. Tim Ryan is totally committed to rebuilding Kyiv.

And so is Nancy Pelosi. For Pelosi, funding Ukraine at any cost is more than a foreign policy objective. It's a kind of religious observance.  

Oh, so Jesus wants to send more missiles to Ukraine and the more missiles we send to Ukraine, the less hungry people are going to be? Wait a second, wouldn't Jesus want to do everything possible to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, you irreligious little twit? How dare you quote that book.

By the way, there was a time when Nancy Pelosi didn't want to spend billions of dollars to secure a country's borders. She said it was wasteful and morally wrong. It wasn't that long ago, by the way, it was April of 2017. See if you notice the difference. She's for spending billions at borders now. She was opposed to it then. What changed? Watch. 

Oh, did you catch that? Border security in United States is immoral, but Jesus is strongly for border security and Ukraine and abortion, by the way. It's a sacrament.

As usual, Democrats, as ludicrous this may sound, are united on this point. They stand as one, but also, as usual, a sustained propaganda campaign in the American media has managed to divide the Republican Party. Now, why does this happen every single time? Here's why, because Republican officeholders, no matter how conservative they tell you they are, believe The New York Times. They care deeply what legacy media say. They read The New York Times every day. They don't want to be criticized by The New York Times. And that's how the left controls them every single time.  

If you don't believe it, think back the last two years. You saw the same dynamic in the early days of both the BLM riots and the COVID lockdowns. Nancy Pelosi was out there first taking the most extreme possible position and then a lot of Republican leaders agreed with her. Do you remember that two years ago this month, Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina, running for president (she's conservative) told Americans in the first days of the riots that they deserved to suffer after George Floyd died?  

""In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone,"" she wrote. In the end, it was personal and painful. A lot of people died and that was good because your racism killed George Floyd. That was Nikki Haley's first reaction. She read it inThe New York Times, and she believed it. They all do.

o it shouldn't shock you that Nikki Haley's first reaction to the Russia invasion and Mitch McConnell's first reaction too and the first reaction of so many other Republican leaders was that protecting Ukraine is way more important to protecting you, than protecting America. Mitch McConnell hasn't, to his credit, moved from that. He still thinks it. Here he was yesterday.  

You got to hope that there's some sincere billionaire out there who's going to fund a primary challenge against every single one of those Republican state senators standing by Mitch McConnell, as he said, and we'll quote again, ""I think we all agree the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine."" No, the most important thing going on in the world right now is the state of your country, the one you're supposed to run, the people you're supposed to represent, whose lives are supposed to care about, the ones who can't buy food or gas, the people ODing on fentanyl, 107,000 in a year dead, young people, Americans.  

""But that's nothing compared to Ukraine. We all agree Ukraine is the most important thing."" Really? If you agree with that, you should not be sitting in the United States Senate as a Republican and yet that's their position. Of course, it's Lindsey Graham's position. Just to give you yet another example.  

""Let's take out Putin."" It's weird to see a guy live out his strange little fantasy life on TV live. Lindsey Graham won't come on the show. He's afraid. We could spend the next hour playing clips of Lindsey Graham going back 20 years, making predictions that didn't come true and resulted only in the death of American servicemen and the impoverishment of the United States. He's gotten wrong every single time and he's still out there.

Let's just take out Putin. Really? What would happen then? The country has 6,000 nuclear weapons. Would they be unsecured? You thought we had a mess on our hands when Saddam's arsenals fell into the hands of lunatics and extremists. What would happen to those 6,000 nuclear weapons if we just take out Putin? They don't even think about it. They don't care. They're high on their own supply.  

Dan Crenshaw of Texas, for example, not a stupid guy, just announced that we're, ""investing in the destruction of our adversaries' military"" when we spend $40 billion on Ukraine. Investing in the destruction of our adversaries' military? Since when do we declare war on Russia? Did anybody vote for that? Our adversaries' military? That's what you do in war. Since when are we fighting Russia? Well, since Putin stole the election from Hillary Clinton.

Glad to see that Dan Crenshaw has signed up for this new campaign, but you got to wonder at what cost? Not just the peril, the real peril, that this could escalate into something crushing for the West, but what immediate cost to the United States and our own ability to defend ourselves?   All these people who love the military, do they ever ask that question? 

Right now, Joe Biden and the U.S. Congress have sent so much military aid to Ukraine that our country, the United States, is running out of weapons. According to Bloomberg, ""Pentagon officials say that Kyiv is blowing through a week's worth of deliveries of anti-tank munitions every day. It's also running short of usable aircraft as Russian airstrikes and combat losses take their toll. Ammunition has become scarce in Mariupol and other areas in Ukraine. This is presenting Western countries with a stark choice between pouring more supplies into Ukraine or husbanding finite capabilities they may need for their own defense.""  

That's the line ""they may need for their own defense."" It's a scary world and if you blow it all on Ukraine with finite resources, which we have, sorry, where does that leave you? Undefended.

Now this is happening because senior leaders of the Republican Party instantly bought the New York Times' position on Ukraine, as they instantly bought the New York Times’ position on the BLM riots, as they instantly bought the position of the New York Times on the COVID lockdown. They didn't question what they read. And the consequences - now, we are short on weapons to defend our own country. 

Now, no Democrat ever goes against his own herd, ever. The first reaction of every Democrat is always to read whatever talking points Nancy Pelosi provides. They never listen to the other side. They always go farther in one direction and the Republican Party is always led by people who join them. 

Here, for example, is how Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland responded when Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia raised an objection with ""Oh, wait, what about our country?"" she said. Here's what he said back. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker. Here's a formula for the destruction of democracy – repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation and appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations.  

So, you can't buy baby formula in the United States and maybe you think you can do both at once. You can fund Ukraine and get baby formula for American babies. Maybe you can fix inflation and also fund Ukraine. Speak slowly and tell us how that works. Maybe there's an answer to the question, but notice they don't answer.

They just accuse the person asking the question of working for Putin. ""You're working for Putin. You're against democracy."" They don't tell us how Ukraine is a democracy. They banned the opposition party. That's a democracy? But maybe there's an answer. What is it? Stop name-calling and answer the question, but Jamie Raskin won't do that. None of them will. He screams about Putin. 

Now, 57 Republicans did vote against last night's bill and God bless them for doing it, but many more voted for it. Of course, there was Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and their friend Elise Stefanik. But there was also Republican leadership, top leadership, McCarthy and Scalise. Shameful. And the worst part is this bill will almost certainly pass in the Senate, which is way more left wing even than the House on the Republican side. Chuck Schumer is promising a swift vote on it. That means as soon as tomorrow.  

We reached out to every Republican in the Senate to find out what they plan to do. Most of them didn't bother to reply. None of them will come on the show. That would include Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Chuck Grassley, Mitt Romney also did not respond. We're hoping they'll vote the right way.

But a handful of senators did respond and we want to let you know where they stand. Voting ""no"" will be Mike Braun, Roger Marshall, Marsha Blackburn, Bill Hagerty and Josh Hawley. Rand Paul has also indicated he's opposed the bill. He wouldn't say so, but of course he's against it.  

Lindsey Graham, needless to say, is a yes. He's thrilled. As his office put it, ""Senator Graham has made it clear he supports additional military aid to Ukraine"" because it makes him feel so good inside. Oh, he didn't say that, but that's the truth. Rob Portman of Ohio is leaving, thank heaven. He's also a yes. 

So, is Steve Daines of Montana, ""The senator is leaning yes,"" his office said. They also told us that Daines thinks Russian oligarchs somehow will pay the $40 billion, ""He wants to make Russia cover the costs. He wants to use the seized assets of oligarchs to cover the costs."" Right, okay. A few senators dodged. Pat Toomey, Tim Scott, Cindy Hyde-Smith all refused to give us a direct answer.  

We want to invite any Republican senator who plans on voting for this to come on this show and explain why. Please tell us. We'll let you talk as much as you want. We're not going to sandbag you. We want to know why this is in America's interest, why this is more important than the pressing crises all around us that the rest of us notice and apparently you don't.

So, tell us. You're always welcome.

660	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-inflation-is-too-obvious-to-deny	2022-05-12 23:16:00	Tucker: Inflation is too obvious to deny | Fox News	" Fox News host voices his concerns over record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Usually when there is a scandal or a crisis in this country, the people who are responsible for it respond to it by averting their gaze. They just ignore it on the principle that if you don't see something, it can't bother you.

""What opioid crisis?"" That usually works. But if it doesn't work and people start to complain about what they've done, our leaders just move to the next stage and deny it's even happening. Racist curricula in your kid's school? Come on, there's no such thing. You're a conspiracy nut. Better call the DOJ.  

Mandatory COVID vaccines that don't actually work as advertised? Please, you're just imagining it. You must be an anti-vaxxer. U.S.funded bio labs in Ukraine? Shut up, traitor, that's pure Russian disinformation and so on. They do this with everything because it almost always works. You may be the injured party in whatever disaster they've managed to cook up, but by the time The Washington Post gets done explaining it, you're a criminal for noticing it happened. It's very effective.

Unfortunately for them, it doesn't work with inflation. Inflation is just too obvious to deny. Everybody knows when inflation hits, when the prices go up, because everybody goes shopping. So when you get inflation, you're stuck with it. Our leaders know this, obviously, so their first move when we got inflation was to reassure us there was nothing to worry about because actually inflation is a good thing. We've been longing for inflation, and thank God we finally got it. ""American needs higher, longer-lasting inflation,"" declared Bloomberg News.

Well, when that didn't work, as it was never going to, because apart from big institutional debt holders, no one in the world actually wants inflation. When that failed, they tried a new tactic. ""Yes, inflation is not ideal,"" they admitted. ""but it's like fog in the morning. It's inconvenient, but it's temporary. It burns off and won't last long."" The word they used to describe this was ""transitory,"" and they used that word a lot. Watch.  

It wasn't just Maxine Waters and Joe Biden and Joe Biden's flack, none of whom can do math, obviously. You just saw the head of the Federal Reserve and the former head of the Federal Reserve tell you this was going to be transitory. That was the best they could do, but behind the reassuring happy talk they were, in fact, starting to panic because this was not at all what they had expected or predicted in public.  

In fact, in September, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, an award that suggests the winner understands economics, signed a public letter urging Joe Biden to spend $2 trillion more because inflation was no longer a concern. There was no way we would get inflation and we're quoting, ""The Build Back Better package,"" wrote these economists, ""will transform the U.S. economy to be more efficient without presenting an inflationary threat."" 

So, trillions of new government spending, were going to make this country more efficient, but we would never get inflation? It was hard to see, even to not an economist, how that could be true. So, this spending, these trillions, were on top of trillions that Joe Biden had already spent, a bill that he'd already signed. That's many trillions. And it turns out when you spend that much, you get inflation.  

The Fed has found that that first bill raised inflation by at least three points, because when you print more dollars, each dollar is worth less. You don't need to be an economist to understand that, but these economists wanted even more spending, and they assured us it would not cause inflation, but of course it did. It was always going to, and by March of this year, that was obvious to everyone so Bloomberg News, which told us inflation was good, now kind of got a little more honest. They wrote a piece offering tips on how to deal with inflation because now inflation was bad. 

Bloomberg told its readers to eat lentils instead of meat and to kill their dogs because pets are expensive. As Bloomberg put it, ""Nobody said this would be fun."" And they were right about that. It hasn't been fun. In fact, inflation has been a disaster for virtually everyone except the big debt holders. Officially, according to numbers out today, the inflation rate is 8.3%, but that's a fake number. It's based on CPI, which is a rigged measure.  

In every real-life scenario, the ones that you go through when you buy things to live, the numbers are much higher. For example, this year, the price of breakfast ceeal, which many people eat in the morning, has gone up by 10%. The cost of chicken nuggets is up 18%. Stick to lentils, Powell.

Canned fruit and vegetables are up more than 10%. Juice, snacks and clothing for your kids is up 9%. The price of baby food, if you can find it, is up 13%. Fertilizer prices – being the basis of all agricultural products –  is up 61% over last year. 

Corn, for example, was at $589 a bushel at the beginning of this year. It's now at $815 per bushel. That's a 38% increase, higher than the CPI. Want to visit your family? Want to take a vacation? Want to take a work trip? The average cost of an airline ticket is now up more than 33% for the year. Gas prices—and you know this well—are up 50%. The average price of a used van was in May of last year was about $23,000. It's now $34,000. That's a 47% increase in a real product that you might have to buy, a used van. It's not 8.3%, according to the CPI.  

The average price of a used crossover SUV is up from $22,000 to $27,000—27% increase. Want to buy a house? Well, you're in trouble. Median home prices are up 16%. And the higher value zip codes are up a lot more than that, hundreds of percent in a lot of places. Here's the bad news for you. If you want to buy one, the 30-year mortgage rate is a 13-year high. So, this really is worst-case scenario. Interest rates get high so people can't afford to buy houses, but home values don't go down because all the houses are being snatched up by big investors, which are converting them to rental units so you will owe nothing and be happy.  

These are very distressing trends and everybody feels them and that explains why a recent poll from Pew found that inflation is at the very top of Americans' list of concerns. Ukraine, which everyone in Washington is obsessed with (Mitch McConnell has told us it's the single most important issue in the world.) is not even in the top ten concerns of American citizens. 

So, you look at a poll like that and many more like it, and you reach the obvious conclusion. You have no choice. If you live in Washington, you are responsible for inflation, you pretend that you care about inflation and you think it's bad. It's been pretty easy for Joe Biden to say this because you can blame food inflation, just like he blamed Donald Trump's election, on Vladimir Putin. So, that's what he's doing.  

Not only did Vladimir Putin singlehandedly hack the DNC and embarrass the Democratic Party, which is the greatest felony one can commit, but he wrecked our economy. How did he do that from the other side of the world when he runs an economy totally detached from ours? Good question, but that's really all they have at this point and you can see, given that, why Democrats are encouraging war in Ukraine, why they want that war to last forever. If the war in Ukraine ever ended, who would they blame for the effects of their deranged policies? They'd have to pick a new person – probably you.

But in point of fact, Vladimir Putin, for all of his faults, did not cause inflation in the United States. The people who run our economy in the U.S. government caused inflation in the United States, and they did it the old-fashioned way by printing a ton of money very quickly and that devalued our currency as printing a ton of money very quickly always does. Now the way this is measures with something called M2, that's the data set that the Federal Reserve uses to measure money supply. Our M2 money supply is not just going up. Our money supply is going up faster than it ever has in American history. As of today, M2 stands at more than $22 trillion. For reference, on February 3, 2020, it was at 15.3 trillion. That is, if you don't have a calculator handy, a 43% jump in our nation's money supply in just over two years.  

What's the result? The result is predictable and obvious. Inflation is going up much faster in the United States than is in, say, Europe, where they didn't spend as much on stimulus. Whatever Putin did or didn't do, none of this is his fault. This pre-dates Putin's invasion of Ukraine and you don't need to be a right winger to acknowledge that. Even CNN is acknowledging that.  

Everyone understands what's going on here. Sorry, it's not Putin's fault. It's the fault of the people currently in charge and that makes Joe Biden very much like the classic arsonist firemen. He created the disaster he now claims he will fix. ""Oh, I just happened to be here. I'll put it out."" 

Biden caused this and not just Biden, Janet Yellen, his whole economic team and by the way, the legacy economic team. This has been going on for a long time. It's not just Biden, but he has made it much worse and he's done it on purpose.

Biden is shutting down domestic energy production. The administration just canceled sales of federal oil leases. Why are they doing this? Why are they making it worse? Everything depends upon the price of energy. Everything you buy was trucked there or brought by ship or plane or rail. You need energy to bring you the products that you buy. And if the price of energy goes up, so does the price of those products. It's really simple. So, when you hike the price of energy, which they've done on purpose, you're increasing inflation, period. You don't need to be an economist to understand that, much less a Nobel Prize-winning economist. 

Why are they doing this? Well, there are three reasons. First, they have to do it. America's sovereign debt levels are way, way too high. We basically nationalized the debt, which is, say, we transferred it to taxpayers from the, oh, wait, meltdown. So, we have way too much debt and the only way out of that is to devalue the U.S. dollar. Otherwise, the U.S. government won't be able to afford the interest payments on the money that it owes. No one says it out loud, but it's absolutely true.

We have to have inflation or else the U.S. government will default. You have to pay the price for their bad policies. Okay? So, the morons who mismanaged the American economy need inflation. Thank you, Janet Yellen. The rest of us could have seen this coming ten years ago, but somehow you didn't.  

The second reason is that rising energy prices justify their transition to the Green New Deal. Nobody in America would ever choose to transition to green energy, which is to say to put trillions of U.S. tax dollars into the pet investment projects of Democratic donors. No one would ever do that voluntarily. But they're hoping that the price of fossil fuels will go so high that you have no choice. ""Oh, you can't afford to fill your truck. Guess you're going to need a Prius now, and we're definitely going to need to control the thermostat in your home."" 

Now, if that sounds too sinister to be real, it is real. Yes, it's sinister. It's also real and here's Joe Biden's commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, who ran the state of Rhode Island, of all places. Shouldn't that be disqualifying? Yes, it should. Somehow, she got a cabinet post. Here she is, still employed amazingly, telling you that climate change is existential and therefore more important than your picayune concerns, like putting clothes on your kids. Watch this.  

""Forget about clothes on your back (Meaning your children's back). Forget about your children. Climate change is existential. We can use it to justify anything, any power grab, any failure, any disaster that we caused and should have stopped before it got completely out of control and take the whole economy. Climate change! Climate change!"" 

Pressing the U.S. economy to the brink actually has uses for the Biden administration. They will use your economic suffering as a pretext for assuming control over every aspect of your life and that's the third reason they're doing this to our economy. As Samantha Power, who has no grounding whatsoever in even balancing a checkbook – she's a lady who became famous for writing a book that informed us that genocide is bad. Really? 

Did you know that? Samantha Power discovered genocide is bad. ""Oh, she cares more than you."" As she put it just the other day, ""never let a crisis go to waste.""  She actually said that out loud. 

Now, Democrats in Congress recognize that this is an opportunity. It's an opportunity for them, not simply to get more power, but to make certain their preexisting obsessions become law and, of course, always to lecture you. Here's Congresswoman Katie Porter of California explaining that because inflation is so high, we need more abortion. Watch.  

Now, she said that live on TV and the other side of the camera was a host called Larry O'Donnell over at MSNBC and she just said out loud. This member of Congress said, ""Yeah, I mean, it's sad that you can't afford to have children in this country, but the upside is now you get to end their lives early so you shouldn't have to feed them. So really, there is kind of a silver lining in that cloud."" 

""We're upset about the economy,"" say the American people. Lady from California goes,"" Have an abortion."" That's her answer? What country is this? What are you even talking about? That's insane and so dark.

But you can be certain this is the one thing you can count on, that the left will never propose a solution to problems, even problems they caused, that, in the end, disempowers the Democratic Party. Every solution makes them more powerful.

How long before Joe Biden decides he can set retail prices? Don't laugh it off. It's coming.

661	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-cause-baby-formula-crisis	2022-05-13 22:16:00	Tucker: This is the cause of the baby formula crisis | Fox News	"Fox News host voices his concerns over the baby formula shortage on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

At a press conference back on March 24th of this year, Joe Biden announced that thanks to the regime change war he's decided to voluntarily wage in Eastern Europe, our country—the United States—will soon face food shortages.  

Food shortages are ""going to be real,"" Biden said. Now, the reporters in the room dutifully transcribed the words and wrote their stories, but you may have missed it. You may not have even heard this because there weren't a lot of follow-up pieces about these man-made food shortages that Joe Biden was predicting and that's weird, if you think about it, because food shortages are inherently a big deal. You could argue they're even more significant than, say, a slap fight between actors at an award ceremony. 

Food shortages are historic events. They overturn societies. They bring down empires, they often have. If you've got food shortages, you've got a potentially destabilizing problem on your hands and now we do have food shortages. They're real, as Joe Biden predicted. As of tonight, at least 26 states are reporting that half their retail stores are completely out of baby formula. That would include the states of Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, and Iowa, and many others. These are major population centers without enough food for newborns. 

In Memphis and Nashville, 52% of stores have no baby formula. Houston and Des Moines are reporting similar shortages. In San Antonio, a city with an unusually high percentage of families with small children, 57% of all stores in the city have no baby formula. Those are the numbers. Journalist Savanah Hernandez went to see for herself what the reality looks like. She went to eight different stores in Texas and not a single one of them had any baby formula to sell. Watch. 

So that's real. You may not like Savanah Hernandez's politics, but she's got a video camera inside Target and they don't have any baby formula. So, babies need to eat, but they can't. Is that a big problem? Yes, it's a big problem. How big? We have a lot of problems right now. Ask yourself, is this a bigger problem than, say, using the wrong pronoun or Trump voters peacefully trespassing in a public building? It seems like a bigger problem than that.  

You would think the Biden administration would do something about it, and they certainly could if they wanted to. They can do anything. These are the people who claim to have the power to control global weather systems, the power to bend human biology to their will, so nothing is beyond the scope of their powers. And yet, in this particular case, Joe Biden is in no hurry to fix the problem. In fact, he joked about it today. Watch.  

""Well, if we'd been better mind readers."" Get it? It's hilarious because actually nobody can read minds. Joe Biden is being sarcastic like your 14-year-old daughter. ""Laugh, Dad, it's not my fault.""

Okay, so Joe Biden does not read minds, but the question is, does anyone in the White House read newspapers or watch television news? Supplies of baby formula were down at least 20% as far back as January. That was not hidden knowledge. It was public knowledge. It was out there if you were looking.  

Here's one representative headline from the FOX affiliate in West Virginia, WVNS, back in February, ""What the baby formula shortage means for parents."" There you have it. Americans were worried about not having enough baby formula. There was a shortage But the White House wasn't concerned and they knew. We know that for certain because Brian Deese, who is the director of the White House Economic Council, just admitted that he knew on CNN, ""We were aware...back in February and... we have had a team on this from the FDA and interagency process since then."" 

Okay, so Joe Biden has been on this problem since February. Why is it still a problem? Why is it still impossible to buy baby formula in stores in San Antonio tonight? Well, the White House has an answer for that, too, and the answer is: greedy mothers. They're the problem. Like Kulaks hiding grain, counterrevolutionary moms in this country are undermining America's baby formula supply. They're ""hoarding baby formula."" Watch Joe Biden's flack explain. 

Oh, now we're down to Zimbabwean economics. We don't have enough to eat because greedy people are hoarding it. It's your fault, America's moms, you and your piggish little babies, always thoughtlessly eating, eating, eating, eating. Show some patriotic restraint and stop buying so much food for your kids, you greedy wreckers. 

That's the White House position on the baby formula shortage. In fact, and it's possible this will not surprise you, the reality is just the opposite of what you heard.  

America's moms are not hoarding baby formula because they're greedy or their fat little babies are eating too much. Sorry, Jen Psaki. The Biden administration is hoarding baby formula. The administration's WIC program, formerly known as Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, is by far the largest purchaser of baby formula in the United States. That is true no matter what they're telling you from the podium at the White House.  

Here's how it works. States award a contract to a baby formula manufacturer to provide the product to WIC participants. Then, people who receive WIC benefits take a voucher to the store and buy the baby formula from that manufacturer. Now, government agencies get a kickback from the manufacturer in the form of a rebate, sometimes as high as 85% of the wholesale price. In other words, the baby formula manufacturer essentially pays the government to maintain this monopoly, and it's good business for everybody. It's been going on for a long time.  

The problem right now is that the Abbott Nutrition Company has made the baby formula for the vast majority of WIC contracts. The government had all its eggs virtually in Abbott's basket. Unfortunately, Abbott just closed its plant in Sturgis, Michigan because of contamination, and that means that millions of people who used WIC to buy Abbott products are forced to buy competing formulas and they're doing it all at once.

So, a government monopoly, overseen by Joe Biden, caused this baby formula crisis. What's the government doing to fix it? Well, here's what they're not doing. They're not invoking the Defense Production Act to manufacture more baby formula. Of course not, that's for Ukrainians only. Shut up, American moms.

Instead, the Biden administration is doing the opposite, which is to say doing the unimaginable. They're shipping scarce baby formula to the southern border to benefit illegal aliens who have no right to be here in the first place. Now, we know this because of a Florida congresswoman called Kat Cammack. Here's the video.  

That's real, by the way. The administration does not deny that it's real. Congresswoman Cammack also uploaded these two pictures onto Twitter. The one on the left is from the Ursula Processing Center at the border, ""shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,"" the congresswoman wrote. The second is from an empty shelf here in the United States, reserved for American citizens. 

There's never been a clearer statement of the administration's priorities. ""Hey, American mothers, your kids are too expensive. Go have an abortion and get back to work at an Amazon warehouse."" Congresswoman Katie Porter of California said that out loud this week. You're poor? Have an abortion. Get back to work. Other Democrats said the same. ""Try breastfeeding!"" wrote 76-year-old Bette Midler today on Twitter, ""It's free and available ondemand."" 

It's been a while since she's done that, but that's her position. So here you have an elderly, out-of-touch rich, liberal lady lecturing struggling American moms to shut up and suffer in silence and, by the way, make your baby shut up, too. Now, if you can think of a more perfect distillation of modern politics of the left circa 2022 than that, send us an email and let us know what it is because we've never seen anything that perfect.

And yet, here's the interesting part. That's not at all the message that the Bette Midler's of the world are sending to the millions of illegal aliens who are flooding into our country. The message to them is just the opposite. ""Come, we welcome you. We will subsidize your childbearing, whatever it takes. Even if we have to take baby formula for American citizens, we will help you."" That's literally what they're saying and more to the point, that's what they're doing.  

How do you get the Biden administration to pay attention to American citizens, to you? Let's say you need baby formula and you can't get it. Joe Biden doesn't care. Bette Midler's mocking you, ""Go breastfeed. It's free."" How do you get them to awaken to the fact that you exist, that American children are suffering? Well, it turns out there is a way to do that. 

The baby formula shortage, and we looked this up, like every crisis in this country may affect you, but it affects trans people disproportionately because trans people are always (and Joe Biden often says this) the ones who suffer most. As Congresswoman Cori Bush once told us, nothing is more important than protecting birthing people.  

Oh. Well, it's the last line that's going to get Joe Biden's attention. So, your kids don't have enough to eat, they can't be bothered to help you at all, though they caused this problem. But once Joe Biden finds out that the trans community is suffering, once he sees the faces of that suffering, he will do all he can to help. He'll airlift those pallets of formula from the border and distribute them to the many American trans mothers who need them. Once he sees these faces, and here they are ladies and gentlemen, straight from your Calvin Klein ad, pregnant men.

The pregnant man emoji, Joe Biden. Do it for the pregnant man emoji.

662	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-democratic-party-change-electorate	2022-05-17 22:38:00	Tucker: The Democratic Party has decided they will change the electorate | Fox News	"Fox News host weighs in on the Buffalo shooting and gives his take on Democrats and the media discussing voter demographics on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Last May, a 17-year-old high school senior called Payton Gendron received an assignment in his economics class. The assignment asked, ""What do you want to do when you retire?"" He answered, ""Commit murder-suicide."" Gendron's teacher immediately reported his threat to authorities who sent him to the emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation. 

Gendron was there for just 20 hours as he wrote later in his diary, ""I got out of it because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That's the reason I believe I'm still able to purchase guns.""

But he was lying. Gendron's intention to commit mass murder was, as he later wrote, ""Not a joke. I wrote that down because that's what I was planning to do,"" 

And he was. Payton Gendron was mentally ill. His classmates knew that. Gendron made strange facial expressions and said odd things in class. Last year, he showed up for school for a full week wearing a hazmat suit — boots, gloves, everything, recalled another student.  

Police and school administrators understood perfectly well that Gendron was potentially dangerous. That's why they sent him to the psych ward. Even his own parents must have known that something was very wrong. Gendron's diary describes how his mother helped him bury a cat he had beaten to death in the garage and then beheaded with a hatchet. On Saturday, Payton Gendron, as you know, finally did what he said he would do. He committed mass murder. 

He opened fire on a crowd of strangers in a Buffalo supermarket. He murdered 10 of them. So how did the adults around him let this happen? In a country with functioning leadership, we would be asking that question. The signs of mental illness were certainly there. The people in charge missed those signs or didn't take them seriously enough or weren't paying close enough attention. In any case, they didn't fix it. They let a killer slip through. 

So, what did they do wrong with Payton Gendron, and how can we learn from it? We should learn from it if we want to prevent more mass murders. But that's not at all what our leaders are asking tonight. Hardly. Instead, they're asking the only question that ever occurs to them – how exactly can I benefit from this? How can I leverage this tragedy to my advantage? How can other people's suffering make me more powerful?  

It didn't take long for Joe Biden to find a way. Biden flew to Buffalo this morning to speak about what Payton Gendron did. There have been a number of mass murders since Biden became president. Some of them have been racially motivated. A little over a year ago, in fact, there was even another supermarket massacre that happened to have the same casualty total. 

A Syrian-born man murdered ten people in Boulder, Colorado, even used the same caliber rifle that Payton Gendron brought to Buffalo, but Joe Biden didn't bother to fly to that crime scene. He didn't go to any of them, in fact. Biden went to Buffalo today because he thought he could blame his political opponents for what happened there, which, of course, he promptly did. Watch.  

January 6 and the Buffalo Massacre — so how is a political protest at the Capitol related to a murder spree by a demented teenager in New York State over the weekend? What do those two events have in common and who exactly are these unnamed heads of state who are connecting these unconnected events in conversations with Joe Biden? You may have wondered that, but don't ask because it's not meant to be asked. It is instead a dream sequence.  

It's a rhetorical device meant to connect everything that might challenge Joe Biden and bunch all of these things together in the same repulsive moral category. January 6, mass murder, the bubonic plague—it's all the same. It's all bad. And because it's bad, Joe Biden informed us today, after 250 years, we're going to have to suspend the Bill of Rights and we're going to begin where the Bill of Rights begins, with the freedom of speech.  

The relentless exploitation of the Internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. Okay. But can anyone show, has anyone ever shown that this specific case, Payton Gendron, was ""recruited and mobilized by the internet""? Well, no, in fact. By his own account, he was mentally ill. He snapped. He'd been planning this for a long time. He did what his diseased brain commanded him to do. The internet did not make him do it. He did it himself, but even if he had been ""radicalized by what he read on the Internet,"" what then exactly?  

Many have been radicalized by what they've read. Pol Pot was radicalized by reading Das Kapital. He went on a murder spree. He killed more than a million people. Should we ban that book? Should we ban all books, all internet sites that ""radicalize people?"" What exactly is Joe Biden saying here? Well, he's saying that thanks to what happened in Buffalo over the weekend, you no longer have any rights at all, including the most basic, which is to read what you want. After nullifying the First Amendment, Joe Biden moved to the Second Amendment.  

  

So, because a mentally ill 18-year-old used a specific rifle to commit these crimes, you can't have that rifle. Now, Joe Biden's bodyguards can have that rifle, so can Nancy Pelosi's and of course, they do. In fact, you pay for it all. But they're important, and you are not, so you can't. So, because the people in charge failed to protect shoppers in Buffalo, you're not allowed to defend your family despite the fact you may believe your family is every bit as important as Joe Biden and his family and Nancy Pelosi and her family, but they're not as important. 

So, we're going to defund the police and disarm you. That's how it works now, sorry.

And then Joe Biden got to the main point of his speech, which is that people who criticize his immigration policies are responsible for the violence you saw in Buffalo. Here's the president of the United States explaining that.  

So you lock the country down, lock kids out of their schools for two years, force them to get ""educated on the internet,"" but it's someone else's fault that they're ""alienated."" They've been hearing about the great replacement theory. You've heard a lot about the great replacement theory recently. It's everywhere in the last two days and we're still not sure exactly what it is. 

Here's what we do know for a fact. There is a strong political component to the Democratic Party's immigration policy. We're not guessing this. We know this and we know it because they have said so.  

They've said it again and again and again. They've written books on it and monographs and magazine articles. They have bragged about it endlessly. They talk about it on cable news constantly and they say out loud, we are doing this because it helps us to win elections. That's not something that is said once. It's something that gloated about again and again and again and we think that's wrong and in case you doubt us, here they are.  

So, you played clips of them saying it, and you're the deranged conspiracy nut. Maybe the funniest part is they may not be right. The Democratic Party has decided then, rather than convince you, people who are born here, that their policies are helping you and making the country better and stronger, they will change the electorate. Again, they say that. We're not guessing.

But the funniest part is they may be wrong, actually, judging by recent polling. It turns out your average Salvadorian landscaper's politics are a lot closer to Donald Trump's than they are to Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. So, their basic calculation may be completely wrong, but that's not even the point.  

It has nothing to do with who we're letting in. It has nothing to do with race and ethnicity. It has to do with two things. One: the purpose of the U.S. government is to serve American citizens, period. Two: you should never craft any federal, which is to say, nationwide policy in order to help a specific political party. That is by itself in isolation, immoral. It doesn't matter what the policy is, and that's exactly what they're doing. And again, they brag about it and not just Democratic Party politicians.  

Virtually every media figure on the left has been bragging about this for decades. Oh, it's a conspiracy theory. Really? Well, here's Ana Navarro from her time as a Harvard fellow. This is what she wrote, ""The demographic trends show that the minority vote in the United States will continue to grow in numbers and influence. Unless you're under the influence of hallucinogens, it is hard to imagine future scenarios where the Republican Party can win national elections."" That piece, by the way, is called ""Old White, Straight Male Voters Ain't What They Used to be."" 

So, let's see. If you don't want people to be paranoid and angry, maybe you don't write pieces like that and rub it right in their face and give them the finger day after day. Maybe that would deescalate it a little bit. You think, Joe Biden, Ana Navarro? But they're not the only two. This has been the prevailing view on the left for a long time.  

Here's a Politico piece from 2013. We could go on for hours, by the way, but here's this: ""Immigration reform could be a bonanza for Democrats."" The Democratic Party, the piece said, are, ""pumping as many as 11 million new Hispanic voters into the electorate a decade from now in ways that could produce an electoral bonanza for Democrats and cripple Republican prospects in many states, they now win easily.""

Again, as noted, that calculation may be completely wrong. A lot of those people the Democrats are importing may wind up being deeply sympathetic to the other party because they're actually not White liberals. That's the secret. But it almost doesn't matter how they vote. Thinking about politics in those terms is immoral. That is wrong. You are gaming the system. That is not democracy. It's the opposite, and they bragged about it for more than a decade. 

Here's another example, also from 2013. The Center for American Progress announced that, ""Supporting real immigration reform that contains a pathway to citizenship for our nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants is the only way to maintain electoral strength in the future.""

Oh, great replacement theory, anyone? These people are lunatics. They're telling you what their strategy is. When you note it, they scream at you and call you a criminal. In 2018, the New York Times published an editorial called, ""We Can Replace Them."" Just in case subtlety is not your thing, ""Right now, America is tearing itself apart as an embittered, White, conservative minority clings to power, terrified of being swamped by a new, multiracial, polyglot majority."" Right, ok.  

In 2020, Joe Scarborough – real moral voice over at MSNBC – quoted this: ""Trumpism accelerated damage done by demographic changes and will harm Republicans for years. Demographics is destiny.""

Are you allowed to say that? Once again, they're wrong and if you haven't looked at a an electoral map recently, look at the districts. The almost 100% Hispanic districts in the Rio Grande Valley that are bearing the brunt of our open borders, they're now red. 

So. you're wrong, Joe Scarborough, but the fact that you're saying demographics is destiny tells you the great replacement theory is coming from the left. They don't think it's a theory. They think it's real.  

In 2021, the Washington Post's Jen Rubin celebrated a report that the number of White people in this country was declining. Can you even imagine? ""This is fabulous news,"" she wrote. ""Now we need to prevent minority White rule."" My God, talking like that. Is there any more divisive thing you could write? We could give you a million more examples. We're offended by this because it's wrong and we've said so, but for saying so, according to Carl Cameron on MSNBC today, we should be thrown in jail. Watch.  

""Maybe taking some names and putting people in jail."" Hmm. Who would those people be? Well, thanks to the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, we now know. Schumer just sent a letter to our bosses here at Fox News blaming this show for the mass murder in Buffalo, as well as several other mass shootings in recent years. According to Chuck Schumer, this show spreads ""dangerous rhetoric and needs to be pulled off the air immediately in the name of public safety.""

Now, again, Chuck Schumer is a federal official. He is the leading Democrat in the United States Senate and he is calling for media censorship. Now, there was a time like maybe 18 months ago when that would be considered a direct violation of the First Amendment. Now we hear it every day. ""Let's throw them in jail.""

We wanted to hear more from Chuck Schumer about this. We invited him on the show tonight, as we always do, but because he is a coward, this is the only media appearance probably in history he's turned down.

Believe it or not, in 1980, which wasn't that long ago,  in Latin America. It had the highest wages. It had the best health care and education. It also had, by the standards of the region anyway, a famously stable democracy. Then came an energy crisis, and Venezuela wound up with inflation. At times, it reached 100% a year. Inflation makes people poor. So, in a very short time, the poverty rate in Venezuela doubled.  

By 1995, 66% of all Venezuelans were impoverished. Getting poorer tends to make voters radical. So inevitably, Venezuela got radical politics. You know what happened next. Venezuela is now rated one of the most miserable places on planet Earth. A few years ago, citizens in Caracas were reduced to eating zoo animals. There was no food and for that matter, there was no electricity. So, in just half a lifetime, an advanced society had reverted to the Stone Age.  

The United States is not in danger of becoming Venezuela next week, but we are moving closer to it. Inflation is a big part of the reason. Of all the economic crises the country can face, inflation is the most dangerous.  doesn't just make people poor. It totally destroys their confidence in their leaders, the authorities who issued the now worthless currency they're using for toilet paper. Inflation is not an act of God like a drought or hurricane. It's an act of negligence, like drunk driving. It is proof that the people in charge are reckless and stupid. That's why  tends to topple governments. 

Once you get inflation, there's no pretending you've done a good job. You have not done a good job and everybody knows it.

So, you can see why the  is very worried about this.  has historically low approval ratings. Voters say inflation is their top concern. Those two facts are directly related. Biden's most pressing task right now is reassuring Americans that he understands they're suffering under inflation and under a rapidly worsening , and he's got a plan to fix it. If he can't convince Americans of that, it may be a long time before we have another  president.  

Thankfully, Joe Biden has a plan, or at least a new publicist, a silver-tongued wordsmith/policy guru called Karine Jean-Pierre. It is Karine Jean-Pierre's job to take this message of economic hope to the American people and save the Biden administration. She started Monday. Here were her first words from the podium.  

So, that was a little confusing. It wasn't actually about America. It was about her, but still, we learned that Karine Jean-Pierre is a Black lesbian, the firstever in history, she reminded us, to hold this particular job. Listen carefully. That shattering you hear in the background, it's a thousand glass ceilings cracking simultaneously into millions of tiny pieces and then being swept with the custodians of tomorrow into the trash bin of bigotry and hate. Soon they'll be trucked to a landfill and buried.  

It's a new day, America. How do you feel? You still can't afford to have your refrigerator fixed or go to the dentist. On the other hand, Karine Jean-Pierre has good news for you about herself. Karine Jean-Pierre has just reached a highly significant personal goal and understandably, she's brimming with self-esteem. Congratulations, Karine Jean-Pierre. Your promotion is America's promotion. Hope it feels good. You're going to want to hold on to that sensation, the one you're now experiencing, and treasure it in the days ahead like a hand warmer as America becomes poorer than you ever imagined possible, and it is.  

As of tonight, . Oh, no big deal. Well, it is actually a big deal because as a result of that, several children have just been hospitalized in the state of Tennessee. Fertilizer prices, meanwhile, have hit record highs. That will mean food shortages around the world. Famine in some places, starvation. It'll mean shortages here. Food inflation, Bloomberg reports, will ""leave no household unscathed"" and then gas prices also just hit an all-time high. They're not going down.  

Mike Jennings, the CEO at a major refiner, says gas prices will stay high for the foreseeable future: ""I don't see any signs of it ending soon or well"" and that's true of inflation across every major sector of the economy. Axios reporting tonight that, ""Inflation is pushing prices higher and higher and some of those costs may never come back down to the levels Americans were accustomed to before the pandemic."" 

More than half the CEOs in this country publicly predict that recession is imminent. That's what they're saying in public. Imagine what they're saying in private. Morgan Stanley says there's a 27% chance we get a recession in the next 12 months. That's up from 5% just two months ago. 

So, that's scary, but the scariest fact of all, we appear to be running out of   never passed the  but we somehow got it anyway and here are the results. According to The Wall Street Journal, ""From California to Texas to Indiana, electric grid operators are warning that power generating capacity is struggling to keep up with demand. That gap could lead to rolling blackouts during heat waves or other peak periods as soon as this year."" In other words, turn off your air conditioning in August and it won't work and neither will your lights. 

The Midcontinent Independent System operator, which oversees the energy grid in the Midwest, says it's preparing to ""take emergency measures in advance of capacity issues this summer."" In other words, no more electricity. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which oversees energy output in the country, released an assessment this year saying the entire western U.S. is ""at risk of energy emergencies due to the limited supply of electricity available for transfer."" 

So, this has never happened. It's happening now. Why? Why is this happening? Well, according to The Wall Street Journal, ""the challenge is that wind and solar farms, which are among the cheapest forms of power generation, don't produce electricity at all times and need large batteries to store their output for later use.""

Now that's only a big problem.  It turns out to be an insurmountable problem given that nearly half of new electricity generation capacity in the U.S. last year — 42% was from land-based wind farms — put a lot of eggs in the wind basket and some states like California have pledged to use 100%, ""renewable energy"" by 2045. So, maybe we will have scientific innovation by 2045 that make that possible. If we don't, California will have even less power than it does now. 

You didn't think, growing up in this country, there would come a time when they couldn't keep the lights on. Now, that time is here. That's shocking. But if you're upset about it, we'd like you to pause and return your attention to the fact — and we're going to say this slowly so we can sink in—our new White House press secretary is a Black lesbian. 

Oh, hooray. The White House press corps was duly impressed, tamed in fact, which is the point of telling them that, but our Peter Doocy did have one question: What is the Biden administration doing about our collapsing economy, and how exactly is the plan to increase taxes on American citizens going to help them pay for things? Here's how Karine Jean-Pierre responded.  

Now, you wouldn't have thought it was possible to take talking points that stupid, that barely literate, that childish, and make them even dumber and yet, that's exactly what she did. Are you still not convinced that Joe Biden knows how to handle inflation? Did that rattle your confidence rather than bolster it? Then honestly, there's nothing we can do for you at this point. You're beyond reach. 

In fact, you know what you are, and you may have seen this coming – you're a racist. That's what we call people who continue to ask complicated, long questions about Joe Biden's economic program. They're racists, and getting rid of them is America's greatest problem. Here's MSNBC to remind you.  

Did you hear that from the comb-over, guy? Free speech is White supremacy, says Chuck Todd. It's White supremacy, free speech. Talking out of turn, reading your own script rather than the one that Chuck Todd provides you is White supremacy. That means if you're upset about food shortages or blackouts, you're a racist –  racist, racist, racist. 

There you are complaining again about the precipitous decline in your standard of living. That's always the first sign of a racist. Oh, you don't like crime. You don't like litter? You don't like inflation? You're against public urination in New York City? You know what you are? You're a bigot, pal. Stop complaining. You and your free speech. 

Gayle King of CBS is a journalist, a talented and highly awarded broadcast journalist, so she knows exactly how racist you are. You're so racist that Gayle King's family members won't even go outside anymore. Watch this.  

Yeah, White supremacists just come out and kill them with the First Amendment. That's what happens when you walk your dog in this country. That's how bad it is. Racism against Gayle King's family may be the single biggest problem America faces right now. In fact, it is. The problem is definitely not that we're running out of energy to power civilization. That's not a big deal at all and that's why you probably didn't read about the fact that the Interior Department just announced it is closing millions of acres to domestic energy production. Sorry, gone. Can't have the energy there. It exists, but you can't have it. You know what we can do, though? Buy it from Venezuela. Yes, we can.  

Twenty minutes ago, they told you Venezuela was a criminal regime. Now Venezuela is going to provide the oil, not us. We can't. That's immoral because climate change is existential, but Venezuela can. And United States, the Biden administration, is doing everything it can to allow the United States to buy Venezuelan oil directly.

What does that add up to? Don't think about that. Thinking about it is racist. It's like the First Amendment. It's White supremacy and if you don't believe it, Karine Jean-Pierre is here to remind you.  

Donald Trump is running a racist campaign.  

The Grand Wizard of the Birther Movement, which birtherism is inherently racist.  

By the way, he's a racist and a bigot, which we already knew.  

  

You know what we need to talk about? Karine Jean-Pierre just told you. You know what we need to have a conversation about, and by conversation we mean, ""You shut up, I talk."" We need to have a conversation about how racist you are, which is very racist. 

So, if you can't keep the lights on or go to the dentist, or if you're one of the very few people, maybe three in the country who ha noticed that honey prices have doubled since December. Why is that happening? Shut up, racist.

We want to open this evening with a story you may not have heard, but that you should definitely know about. It begins early last year when , in one of his very first acts as president, brought the United States back into the . 

We saw this, and we thought: Why would Biden be so anxious to do something like that? At the time, we assumed it was just part of his larger de-orangification effort.  had pulled the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, so Biden had to do the opposite. Childish, but that seemed like a fair explanation.

Still, it did seem a little weird because there aren't many international bodies that are more thoroughly discredited than the World Health Organization, particularly after  It's a laughingstock. There's one thing it's not good at, it's public health.  

Since the very first cases of the coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, the W.H.O. slavishly ran interference for the  and did it in the most cartoonish and obvious way. First, W.H.O. claimed there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Remember this? They cited Chinese officials who were obviously lying, and we now know they were lying.  

Then, when it became clear the virus probably came out of a Chinese government lab, W.H.O. sabotaged the investigation into the origin of the virus by appointing a gain-of-function researcher to lead the investigative team. Pretty shocking, if you think about it and to this day, the W.H.O. still has not acknowledged it did any of that, though it definitely did.  

Instead, they've continued to praise China's response to COVID as ""transparent,"" which is the one thing it's not. It's almost amusing. But again, it's weird if you think about it. Why would Joe Biden want to join a group that every informed person laughs at? Well, more than a year later, we think we know the answer. The Biden administration is very close to handing the World Health Organization power over every aspect, the intimate aspects, of your life.  

So, imagine the civil liberties abuses that you lived through during the COVID lockdowns, but permanent and administered from a foreign country. Here's what we're looking at tonight. This January, the Biden administration submitted a series of proposed amendments to something called the International Health Regulations (the IHR). Now, the Biden administration's amendments, along with those from several other countries, will be combined to create a new global pandemic treaty. ""We need a pandemic treaty."" That treaty is set to be adopted starting this weekend in Geneva at the World Health Assembly. 

 Now, the full text of the treaty is not yet finished, but a W.H.O. working group has summarized what it's going to look like. The document begins by promising to restrict the W.H.O's authority just to pandemics. Calm down, it's just pandemics: ""W.H.O. Secretariat to play the leading, convening and coordinating role in operational aspects of emergency response to a pandemic."" 

So, don't get paranoid. Someone just needs to coordinate the  response globally because it's a global problem. Got it? Settle down, conspiracy nut,

But here's the catch. The World Health Organization gets to define what a pandemic is, when a pandemic is in progress and how long a pandemic lasts. Then you read the fine print and you realize the W.H.O will have total authority over emergency operations in the United States if there's ever a ""public  emergency."" Huh? 

What qualifies exactly as a public health emergency? Well, they don't define that, but they get to. They get to decide what a public health emergency is, and then they have total authority. You can see where this is going. Now, the  has made certain that unelected bureaucrats, the W.H.O., have total authority to declare and define public health emergencies. They did it explicitly. The White House eliminated a provision that would have required the World Health Organization to ""consult with an attempt to obtain verification from the state party in whose territory the event is allegedly occurring in."" 

So, as originally written, they couldn't do anything without the permission of their member countries' governments. But thanks to the change that the Biden administration pushed, effectively there is no limit at all on W.H.O's power and then it gets worse from there. The treaty also mandates a ""whole of government and a whole of society approach to pandemic preparedness."" 

Think about that. Every society is always preparing for a pandemic, and that means there will not be a moment ever when the W.H.O. doesn't have operational control over so-called public health matters in this country. Now, what's that going to mean exactly? You've already guessed. It's not really about public health. It never is, but before we tell you what exactly it's going to mean, you should know that none of this is going to be optional.  

Thanks to an amendment from the Biden administration, the treaty contains a provision for a compliance committee. oh, there's always the stick. It provides that every member country in the W.H.O. must, ""inform W.H.O. about the establishment of its national competent authority responsible for overall implementation of the IHR that will be recognized and held accountable."" 

Under this treaty, W.H.O. members must enforce orders from the W.H.O. They have to act as the heavies for the W.H.O. and if they don't, they'll be sanctioned. The White House is going to be the muscle for the director of the World Health Organization. 

So, who is the director of the World Health Organization?  Well, that would be a former member of Ethiopia's Marxist-Leninist Party called Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He once led the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia. He's not a physician, but as the head of the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia for political reasons, he covered up three cholera outbreaks, the opposite of what he's supposed to do. He wrote off cholera as simply acute watery diarrhea. He's not a doctor, so maybe he didn't know, but he did know. He did it for political reasons. 

Those outbreaks are taking place among disfavored groups. Then, Tedros tried to appoint , the racist murderer who ran Zimbabwe into the ground as an international goodwill ambassador for public health. Now, at the time, Zimbabwe was the poorest, most mismanaged, most racist country in the world and yet Tedros thought he should be a goodwill ambassador for public health. These are some of the reasons that Tedros, needless to say, is a close friend of   

Yeah, they've done very well. He's an outstanding person, that friend of Robert Mugabe's and because he's such an outstanding person, we are days away from giving him operational control over our government's public health system, the one that you pay for and thought you controlled in this democracy. 

So, what will this operational control mean? Let's be specific. 

Right off the bat, the treaty demands, ""national and global coordinated actions to address the misinformation, disinformation and stigmatization that undermine public health."" Oh, here we go, right to censorship.

People are criticizing us and for public health reasons that can't be allowed. If you criticize us, people will die. 

So, you saw yesterday the Biden administration, in the face of universal laughter and derision, had to fire the head of its new Ministry of Truth, but they found another way to do it. ""W.H.O. Secretariat to build capacity to deploy proactive countermeasures against misinformation and social media attacks."" 

Oh. Are you following this? So, they're going to get to censor anybody who doesn't agree with what they do as they control the intimate details of your life and they will control those details. Under this treaty, the World Health Organization will get to establish vaccine passports and regulate travel. World Health Organization will ""develop standards for producing a digital version of the International Certificate of vaccination and prophylaxis."" 

Okay. So, you may be thinking, ""Well, it's just about COVID and I went along with mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports at the time. How bad could it be?"" First of all, if you went along with that, you should be repenting right about now, but it's not just about COVID, because W.H.O. will be in charge of, ""the digitalization of all health forms."" World Health Organization will also ""share real time information about travel measures.""  

So, you're going to find out exactly when you're allowed to get on a bus or train or airplane or how about your bicycle? Will they regulate that too? Maybe. Now, the World Health Organization has sought this authority for years. Of course, who doesn't want more power? Here's Tedros back in April of 2020. 

Okay. So, there's a guy with a long and documented history of subverting public health, who is clearly a liar, who is acting as an agent for the Chinese government, and you have to ask yourself, ""Did I vote for that guy? Is he one of my elected representatives in this democracy? How did he get power over where I can travel and when?"" Good question.

And it's not just lockdowns that man Tedros would be able to dictate. The World Health Organization would also assume total control over vaccine manufacturing and distribution. We're not making this up, by the way. According the document, W.H.O. would create a,""truly global end-to-end platform for vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and essential supplies, shifting from a model where innovation is left to the market, to a model aimed at delivering global public goods."" Now, we're not making it up. That's a verbatim quote. It actually says that. No more innovation, centralized control.  

According to the treaty, those vaccines and essential medicines—because it gets better on every page—will be distributed not on the basis of need, but on the basis of equity. Equity is quoted, says, ""critically important for global health, both as a principle and as an outcome."" That's what the treaty declares. 

Therefore, the World Health Organization will ensure ""equitable and effective access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and essential supplies and for clinical trials"" and that means, again quoting, ""health care workers and the most vulnerable will have priority access."" Not the sickest, not the people who need the medicine most, but the most vulnerable in a larger sense. In other words, favored groups get medicine first. 

There is no graver violation of medical ethics than this. Every physician, practicing in the United States, promises not to do what you just heard, and it would become mandatory under this treaty. And by the way, the language you just heard, that is exactly the justification that officials in several states threw out when they were caught passing out vaccines based on race. This is a power grab. It's dangerous. It is, by the way, a reward to the very people who screwed up two years of COVID response. Oh, let's give them more power. This is lunacy. And people who know that it's happening are upset.  

125,000 people in the U.K. have just called for a referendum on this treaty. They signed a petition. In a democracy, that would matter. You get to petition your government, you remember? But the British government doesn't care what they think and neither does the Biden White House. In this country, there's been very little pushback because most people have no clue this is happening. We didn't until a bunch of people bothered us about it. ""You should look into it."" We did and were shocked.  

We didn't know because our media isn't covering this. It's not on the front page. Why is that? You have to ask yourself. 

There is at least one planned legal challenge to this and it comes from Stephen Miller's group, America First Legal. Here's what's at stake, not just your health, but the way that you live and your relationship to the government. Representative government requires your consent. You alone have the right to choose your representatives, your style of government, the laws under which you live. That is called democracy, and this eliminates it.

Things are changing fast, as you know, and you can tell how fast they're changing by the way that people talk about politics. Language reflects feelings and thoughts. When your views change, so does the way you talk about them. That's especially true of liberals who have very deep feelings and their main feeling (this has always been true) is contempt for you.  

If you ever , you know exactly how much contempt liberals have for you and you get to pay for it. NPR takes your tax dollars and then lectures you about how immoral you are. That is liberalism distilled. It's been going on a long time. NPR has been running its particular scam since 1971, but the sneering tone you hear on NPR has been the hallmark of liberals for nearly a century.  

Liberals have contempt for Dwight Eisenhower, Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon (boy, did they) and for Gerald Ford even. If you're old enough to remember Ronald Reagan, you will recall vividly how liberals felt about him. ""Reagan was an idiot,"" they told you, ""a mouth breather"" and so was anybody who would vote for him—very much including you. In the words of Al Gore, Republicans were the, ""extra chromosome right-wing."" So, they were literally genetically defective. That's how liberals actually talk.  

Whenever two or more liberals are gathered, you will find sanctimony, but there's a new inflection. You may have noticed it recently. The pivot (and it was a pivot) came six years ago. It was during the 2016 presidential campaign. Liberals seemed to lose any remaining sense of humor the moment . Why? Well, because he called their bluff. Looking back, it's obvious what happened. By 2016, no one could argue that liberal programs or many programs, the various fads and metaphorical wars we were waging on this or that bad thing, there was no evidence that any of it had done anything to improve American life.  

Liberals promised you they would make everything great, but they didn't. In fact, every single liberal enthusiasm failed from radical feminism to urban renewal, from outsourcing to the so-called sharing economy. All of them, each and every one, turned out to be a complete disaster. The reason 2016 was significant is that the liberals could no longer deny this. They couldn't say, ""Give us another 50 years and we'll turn Baltimore into Geneva."" 

They couldn't say that because no one would believe it. Not even their own voters would believe that. So, for liberals, 2016 was a profoundly humiliating moment and those can be good. Well-adjusted adults learn from humiliating moments, but that's not what liberals did. They turned their rage outward and they focused that rage on the people they had failed. You always hate the ones you betray. So, liberals decided they hated the American middle class. In 2016, Democrats stopped making arguments in favor of their own policies, whatever those might be, and instead reoriented the entire party around attacking the very people that historically they had represented. Again, America's middle class. Now they hated them. At a fundraiser she thought was off the record. Hillary Clinton summed up the contempt all of them felt. 

A gaffe? Yeah. In the sense she was telling you exactly what she really thinks. She meant every word of that and the applause that she received was heartfelt, too. They all felt that way and that's why 2016 was the year that you and everybody else became a racist. It was the worst slur they could think of. They used it every day of the 2016 campaign. Racist, racist, racist. 

Well, in the end (and they hated this above all) Donald Trump won more non-White votes than any Republican presidential candidate ever, but they didn't stop. No, they just increased the volume and by 2020, a lot of Americans were just exhausted. ""Fine, we'll vote for a mannequin. If only you will calm down."" That was the unspoken, yet very clear deal that liberals made with the country. ""If you ditch the orange man, we will stop screaming and burning your cities and we can be all Americans again."" 

So, people —maybe not 81 million—but some people did, but Democrats didn't mean it. By January of last year, the Democratic Party had more power than in any time since FDR was president, but the telling point, the tip off, was they didn't seem happy about it. If anything, they seemed angrier than ever. Why? Because they had lost faith in their own program. They controlled everything, but they had no interest in making things better. They were no longer interested at all in social improvement. Social Security—they bragged about that for almost 100 years. They stopped talking about it. Head Start. Remember that? Improving public schools. These were all liberal enthusiasms. They tried them all and none of them worked, so they moved in the other direction.  

Instead of trying to fix the country, they decided to destroy the country and just start over. If you were watching from outside, it looked like they were having a fit. They erupted into uncontrollable, nihilistic rage. They swept the plates off the table, punched a hole in the drywall, threw a base on the TV: ""Burn it down. Let's start over."" They called this the equity agenda and you should have been nervous when you listen to him talk about it, because every time they talked about the equity agenda, they scowled. Joe Biden looked angry at his own inauguration. He had promised hope, but in the end he delivered division and rage. This is Biden on the day he became president:  

Huh? What was that? That wasn't the deal. We got rid of the orange man and you're still calling me racist? Why are you doing that? Why aren't you trying to unite the country? Why don't you win over the people who didn't vote for you? They didn't spend one day doing that. Instead, they moved in the opposite direction at high speed. They all of a sudden declared that trespassing was a felony and threw Trump voters in prison. A lot of them are still there. They set about politicizing the most heavily armed federal agencies, from the FBI to DHS to the Pentagon. That should make you nervous and they did it for a reason because they believed their political opponents were criminals and you know that because they said so. They call them Nazis and White supremacists. You!  

You're not a Nazi or White supremacist. Why are they calling you that? Why are they denouncing you as a seditionist, as an enemy of the state? Why are they demanding that government censor and disarm you because they think you're a terrorist. They deployed thousands of National Guard troops to your capital and kept them there for months. What? Against Americans. We weren't being invaded. Those were Trump voters they claim to be afraid of. They began using language that even the most radical Democrat in Congress just six years ago would have thought was way too extreme and it wasn't just a few of them who did this. Virtually all of them did it.  

Why are they talking like that? It's so obviously untrue and yet they're all reading from the same script. There has to be a purpose here. They're not doing this accidentally. People don't use identical chunks of language on the same day by accident. They thought this through and then they began putting people on television whose only qualification was their willingness to say things that again three years ago, would it be considered beyond the pale and not just a few of them, a lot of them. Here's a former Trump administration lackey telling you with a straight face that the Republican Party is a bigger threat to this nation than al Qaeda or ISIS: 

So, why are they talking this way? Well, what else are they going to talk about? Their record in Detroit for the last 60 years? No. The  the only way it could maintain power, win the next election is to convince you, the voter, that the other side is dangerous. Literally dangerous, not metaphorically dangerous, actually dangerous to your life. The problem is you have to up the ante in every election. If they're White supremacists this election, what are they next election? Nazis. And then what? John Brennan, the former CIA director, said he looked forward to an authoritarian crackdown. You'll notice he lumps in libertarians with fascist bigots and racists. 

That was the month that Joe Biden was inaugurated, the month you'd think liberals like John Brennan would be celebrating Trump's departure, but again, they were angrier than ever and they've gotten angrier since that day. So, where is this going? Well, it's going to the only place it ever could go. Democrats have reached the logical end of name calling. Why? Because they've run out of epithets. Once you've accused your political opponents of being Nazis, White supremacists and then of treason, you have reached the limits of language. When you're dealing with someone who's committed treason, it is now a law enforcement matter.  

People are going to have to be physically punished. So not surprisingly, that is what they are now calling for, ""arrest them."" All of a sudden, you're hearing a lot of liberals say that—not just the crazies but the mainstream people. Willard Mitt Romney, a man who's probably never used the F-word as an end in his entire life, is suddenly accusing Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, one of the most reasonable people ever to serve in the body, of treason. Not accusing her of being mistaken or wrong, but accusing her of betraying her country even as she serves it in uniform. What's the penalty for that? Well, it's prison. At least watch.  

Yeah, it's ""The View."" They're harpies. They're ridiculous. They're stupid. All true, but what was so surprising is that that wasn't even considered much of a news story. It's that common. A liberal fundraising group called ""Call to Action"" is now demanding the arrest of Clarence Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, someone who, as far as we know, hasn't done anything wrong apart from marrying a man that liberals don't like. 

So, even five years ago, some liberal group was raising money on the idea Ginni Thomas should be arrested because she's married to Clarence Thomas, that would have seemed demented. Now it's just another cable news segment. A lot of them are like that. Here's former Fox reporter Carl Cameron on CNN this weekend calling for us, this show, to be sent to prison because that's now the fair penalty for disagreeing with Joe Biden, jail time, and the host of the show on CNN seems to think that sounds about right.  

""The administration is beginning to make a move on that,"" says the journalist. Maybe wind up in jail or ""maybe something worse."" Well, what's something worse? We're not sure what something worse is, but it certainly feels like we're moving toward it at very high speed at this point.  

That's the end point to talk like that, ""something worse,"" because rhetoric has its own internal logic. You've experienced it. You can talk yourself into things. We've all done that. Democrats are doing it right now and what they're talking themselves into right now is ""something worse."" It's scary. It is time to pull back. It is time to de-escalate. Otherwise, this is going to get really ugly really soon.

666	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-texas-school-shooting-buffalo-mental-health	2022-05-25 22:40:00	Tucker Carlson: Following Texas school shooting and Buffalo tragedy, leaders should ask this question | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the politicization of the Texas school shooting in Ulvade, reflects on mental illness and stopping violence in America on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

In the past 10 days, two separate teenage boys have committed horrifying massacres in public places. On May 14th, 18-year-old Payton Gendron murdered ten shoppers in a grocery store in Buffalo and then yesterday, 18-year-old  and two teachers at an elementary school in Texas.  

Both Gendron and Ramos were very obviously mentally ill. The people around them knew that. Both killers had told other people they planned to commit a mass shooting and then they did. So, what can we learn from this? Well, the first most obvious answer is that the system in place didn't work. Gendron's teacher sent him to a mental hospital for evaluation. They knew he was a threat. They tried their best. He committed a massacre anyway. So, we know for a fact that what we're doing isn't working, but we should also be honest enough to acknowledge that it's very hard to know what to do instead.  

Despite what you may have heard, the problem isn't that we don't care enough. There's not a person in this country who was not horrified by the sight of . It's the worst thing, and everybody thinks that. The problem is that the human mind is much more complex and harder to control than we like to admit.  

A person who is intent on committing violence is very hard to stop under any circumstances. An act of Congress isn't going to do it, neither will gun control. There are more guns in this country than there are people. There always have been. However you feel about that fact, you can acknowledge that we will never get rid of all of those guns. The Constitution prohibits that, and you would set off a civil war if you tried to do it.  

So gun control, whether you find the slogans appealing or not, will not stop the next Payton Gendron or Salvador Ramos and every rational person knows it. The only way to stop these killings is to figure out why American society is producing so many violent young men. There is a reason they are acting this way. What is that reason? And it's not just mass shooters, by the way, the ones you see on television. It's gang bangers and carjackers and armed robbers and indiscriminate haters who put strangers in front of subway trains. We have a lot of people like that in this country all of a sudden, more than you like to think about.  

Why are they acting this way? That's the only question that matters. Of course, it's the only question our leaders hate to address because there's nothing in it for them. 

Last night, the president of the United States went on television just hours after 19 small children had been murdered. He didn't do that to uplift or unite the country, which was already united in its sorrow. Instead, he took the opportunity to once again harangue anyone who didn't vote for him, and he did it, as always, with a series of stale talking points leftover from the 1980s. It was a shameful display. Here's part of it.  

Children are dying because the gun lobby is profiting. It's disgusting he would say something like that. It's also untrue. It's mindless. The New York Times, by the way, said the same thing within hours of the shooting. The gun lobby. Please. The NRA declared bankruptcy last year. The NRA is a husk. In 2021, for example, the tech company spent more than $70 million lobbying Congress.  

Big Pharma spent $92 million lobbying Congress in the first quarter of 2021 alone. The NRA spent just $2.2 million total lobbying in all of 2020, a presidential election year. Spare us. Whatever the problem is, it's not the gun lobby. They're not the reason those children were murdered yesterday. It's insulting and divisive and stupid. This is too serious a moment for nonsense like that. Stop.

 But over at MSNBC, they were completely convinced. Watch.  

Oh. Joe Scarborough said a naughty word on TV. This must be serious. And fact, i is very serious. In fact, it's too serious for tired partisan platitudes from the Reagan era. Update your profile. Politicians offering solutions to the tragedy that in the end serve only to make their political party more powerful should be excluded from this conversation. It is too important. They are speaking in bad faith, obviously, and so is anyone whose bodyguards carry extended magazines or other so-called weapons of war. They're hypocrites. They have no standing.  

Get back to us when you follow your own demands and anyone on TV who's been accused of a crime should also take this opportunity to be very quiet. No wants a moral lecture from you, but unfortunately that's essentially all we're getting, more wind, at a time when we need more than that. Beto O'Rourke, who is running for office again because he has no marketable skills, just . He did this in front of the families of some of yesterday's victims. Watch.  

Oh, come on. That's saving lives? That's making us a better country? Beto O'Rourke sounds like one of those lunatics from the Westboro Baptist Church, gets off on making a scene, but that's essentially the answer we've gotten to how to fix and prevent what happened in Uvalde. Please, anyone who talks like this should be quiet for a minute and leave it to everybody else to figure out why this is happening and this is bigger than a single mass shooting or even two of them in 10 days. There has been a huge increase in violence in America on our streets, on public transportation, in our schools. It's not a guess, it's measurable.  

From January 1st to April 10th of this year, robberies in the New York transit system are up more than 70% year over year. Felony assaults in the subway have increased by 28%. Grand larceny, according to NYPD, is up by more than 100%. Those are  and that's just underground. The same thing is happening on the streets and if you don't know it, you just got back to the country after a while.  

According to ABC News, ""about 11% of violent crime in the city of Los Angeles involved a homeless person in 2018, 13% in 2019 and 15% in 2020."" If that was a graph, it would look like that. Keep in mind, the homeless make up about 1% of the total population of Los Angeles, but they're involved in nearly a fifth of all violent crimes in the city. Oh, but ignore it. It's not happening. And yet everyone who lives here knows that it is happening because the numbers go up every year and if you have kids, you know what's happening because it's the same story in the schools. 

The executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, Mo Canady, told Fox Business that schools are, ""seeing more aggression in terms of fights. Sometimes they're shoving matches and sometimes they're flat-out assaults. It's more misbehavior, thefts and those kinds of things"" in schools. It didn't used to happen. It's happening now. Why? It's not guns. It's not a gun lobby. 

More American families had guns at home 50 years ago than they do now. According to the Rand Corporation, which studied this, 45% of American homes had a gun in 1980. In 2016, that had dropped to 32%. So the problem is not that we're more armed than we were. The problem is that people have changed. Young men have changed. They are more violent. Why?

That's the bipartisan conversation we need to have now. And that conversation has been drowned out by lunatic attention seekers who are hoping to win the next election, but we don't need them now. Never mind your election. There's something really wrong and we can figure it out if we try.  

There are probably a lot of causes. The use of antidepressants in this country is increasing dramatically. Between 1991 and 2018, total SSRI consumption increased in the US by more than 3,000%. . Remember, these are supposed to reduce mental illness. Now, that's a real stat. It was published in the medical journal ""Science of the Total Environment"" and it's not just this country.  

In Canada, state-funded antidepressant prescriptions for young people doubled over the last decade. Then during the lockdowns, SSRI prescriptions increased even more. A pharmacy group called ""Express Scripts"" reported that antidepressant prescriptions went up by more than 20% during COVID. According to latest figures, more than 40 million Americans are now taking psychoactive drugs. That's roughly 1 in 10.  

So, again, the point of these drugs is to make you healthier mentally, to reduce suicide and violence, and yet suicide rates and rates of violence are spiking. Now, we don't know that that's causation, but it's worth looking at. Of course, it's immoral to criticize Big Pharma. Could we use an honest conversation about this? Yes, immediately. Clearly, something's going on. Watch.  

Oh, so the lockdowns dramatically increase the incidence of mental illness among young people and in 10 days, we've seen two mass shootings by mentally ill young people. Could there be a connection? Now, that's not finger-pointing. It's not to blame Fauci for yesterday's shooting. We're not that low. We're not Joe Biden, but if people are becoming mentally ill because they're disconnected from others, what can we do to connect them to others and thereby reduce the incidence of mental illness? That's a real conversation. Is there a more important one?

Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people just died of ODs and the pandemic is responsible for some of that. Watch.  

Ok. So, people are doing more drugs, they're more unstable, they're killing themselves more often and in some rare cases, they're killing others. Now, what kind of mindset would it take to go ? You are so disconnected from other human beings that that seems okay to you. What could be adding to the feeling of disconnection we have from one another?

Well, in 2020, adults in the United States spent an average of 8 hours every day on digital media staring at a screen. The lockdowns made it worse. They're not the only cause, but they definitely exacerbated it. That's a 20% jump from 2019.  

One of the people who spent an awful lot of time online during the pandemic was the . He reportedly played a lot of Call of Duty instead of going outside. The shooter in Buffalo also spent a lot of time online as well. In fact, he blamed the Internet for radicalizing him: ""I spent almost a year planning this attack,"" he wrote on April 26. ""Oh, how time flies. If I could go back, maybe I'd tell myself to get the f off 4Chan and the worldtruthvideos and get an actual life. Too late for that now."" 

Now, that's not an argument for censoring those or any other sites. It's an argument for experiencing real life, nature, other people, animals, anything but a screen. Staring at a screen all day puts you into your own world, and in some small number of cases, it drives you insane. It makes you mentally ill and violent. That's very obvious. That's one of the reasons that people in Silicon Valley, the tech executives, don't – their own kids – lose themselves in their stupid iPads.

Back in September of 2013 after a  at the Washington Navy Yard, the late Charles Krauthammer identified the problem. We have a lot of mentally ill people and we need to stop ignoring them. Obviously, we've ignored that warning, so here it is again. 

Yeah, exactly. The stuff is complicated, the human mind is complicated and if the environment changes, so does the mind. People can't go outside or talk to other people or spend 8 hours a day staring at a screen. If they're on brainchanging chemicals in huge numbers, tens of millions of people, you think that has an effect?  

Yeah. What effect? Well, is anyone studying what murderers, not just mass murderers, but all murderers, have in common? Apparently not. It would be nice to know. Instead of telling us about the gun lobby. Please, no one believes that. And why, by the way, is the answer to mass shootings always universal gun confiscation?  

Shouldn't we be focused on the people who did it, on the dangerous people? It's like forcing the entire population into drug rehab in response to the fentanyl crisis. Probably better to focus on the addicts. Why did they get addicted? How can we help them?

Let's be serious about this. Children died. It's real. Stop with the talking points. Be honest.

667	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-texas-elementary-school-shooting-critical-question	2022-05-26 23:36:00	Tucker Carlson: Following the Texas elementary school shooting, this is a critical question | Fox News	"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Two days ago, as you know, a mentally ill teenager called  in Uvalde, Texas. The crime was so awful, so completely unimaginable and shocking that it was about 24 hours before most people thought to ask exactly what had happened.  

How was Ramos able to get inside the school? Why did no one stop him as he methodically executed so many children over about an hour? Where was law enforcement? Those aren't just fair questions, though they are, they're essential questions. If you want to prevent similar atrocities, you need details. You've got to find out what exactly happened. This is a well-known concept.  

Every time a commercial airliner crashes in this country, federal investigators painstakingly recreate the final moments of the flight, not because they're ghoulish. They want to know what caused it and that's the main reason that air travel is so safe. After action reports work.  

Yet somehow our leaders rarely respond as rationally to violent crime. Almost never. A  is just too tempting a moment for them to demagog. The public is often grieving and in shock, so it's the perfect moment for the usual opportunists to leap forward and cast blame on their political opponents, to seize all the power they can while the country is too traumatized to notice. You almost never hear anyone in Washington ask what happened. Instead, it's always a race to see who can benefit politically.  

This week was no different. Within hours of Tuesday's massacre, Democrats in Congress announced they plan to clamp down on your ability to defend yourself with a firearm. Why is that? Well, apparently the Uvalde shooting was your fault, so you're going to pay the price. The media applauded this, so Democrats went even further. 

Yesterday, they unveiled their plan to seize firearms from American citizens who have not been convicted of a crime or even accused. Now, under normal circumstances, it would be instantly obvious that that is unconstitutional. In our system, you have to be convicted before you can be punished, but in the hysteria that understandably follows a tragedy this horrible, politicians know that they can suspend civil liberties.

And it's not just Democrats, by the way. Republicans in the Senate immediately signaled they're on board with more gun control. Mitch McConnell, who at the age of 80 has adopted political views that are strikingly similar to Joe Biden's (low t liberal) announced that he stands with Chuck Schumer against you. 

""I am hopeful,"" Mitch McConnell said, ""that we can come up with a bipartisan solution that's directly related to the facts of this awful massacre."" Directly related to the facts. Well, that sounds sensible, but since we're passing new federal laws, it is worth asking: what are the facts here? Well, yesterday  appeared at a press event to relay the main fact, which is that law enforcement on the scene did all they could to save those children. That's the first thing to know. Watch.  

""Law enforcement showed amazing courage by running toward gunfire for the singular purpose of trying to save lives."" Now, we heard that and we wanted to believe it. Most of the time, we admire law enforcement. They take an awful lot of abuse to do a hard and essential job for not much pay. If you think you don't need the police, go ahead and defund them and see what happens. So that explanation sounded good to us. But was it true?  

According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, it was in fact true. A spokesman called Erick Estrada told us that a school resource officer assigned to Robb Elementary in Uvalde exchanged gunfire with the suspect before the suspect entered the school. In an interview with CNN, Estrada stated that the gunman ""engaged"" the school resource officer and during that shootout, the gunman dropped a black bag containing ammunition. The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steve McCraw, affirmed that this happened"" ""The bottom line is law enforcement was there,"" McCraw said, ""They did engage immediately."" So that was the story and again, we were happy to believe it, but it doesn't seem to be true. 

A witness called Juan Carranza, who lives next to the school, said he saw everything that happened. Carranza said to the Associated Press he had watched Ramos crash his truck outside the elementary school, take a rifle and shoot at two people at a funeral home nearby. Ramos then began shooting at the school building before running inside the school about 10 minutes later.

According to Carranza, there were no police officers at the school to engage Ramos. Ramos went into the school and began shooting. When police finally did arrive, Carranza said, they didn't do anything at all for about an hour. In fact, parents had to beg the police to save their children. ""Go in there. Go in there,"" one woman said. It was a shocking story. It was the opposite of what authorities had told us for more than 24 hours.  

So whose version is true? Well, in the last day, videos have emerged corroborating Carranza's version of events. Those videos show police officers with rifles and body armor standing outside the school. It's not clear if the gunman was still shooting at this point, but we do know the gunman was still alive.

And yet instead of going into the school, the police instead worked to keep parents out of the school for a full hour. Watch.  

I know that! I already know! 

Are your kids in there? No! No! Look at that poor little kid, that poor baby. 

You're scared to get shot? I'll go in without a vest. I will, ok? 

That's f------ crazy, bro. They're just standing outside, there's f------ kids in there still. I don't know what type of parent you are but half of these f------ parents want to go in without vests, without guns to get their f------ kids, bro. 

It seems apparent that when that video was shot, the gunman was still alive with the firearm in the school with children in the school. Now, a Texas official later suggested on camera that while all of this was happening, some members of law enforcement in Texas went into the school to get their own children out. Is that true? If it is true, it's a moral crime, at the very least. In the meantime, we know that police were forcibly keeping parents away from the building. At one point, an officer held a Taser at his side.

Taser, of course, aimed at the parents. Now, one parent called Angeli Rose Gomez, told The Wall Street Journal that as soon as she heard about the shooting, she drove 40 miles to the school because she had two sons enrolled, and she wanted to save them. ""The police were doing nothing, ""she said, ""They were just standing outside the fence. They weren't going in there or running anywhere."" 

Now, she immediately complained about this and when she did, Federal Marshals put Gomez in handcuffs. Ultimately, they freed her, at which point Gomez, ""made her distance from the crowd, jumped the school fence and ran inside to grab her two children."" She then ran out of the school with her children. 

In other words, this mother was cuffed, freed, ran into the school and still had time to get her kids out as the police stood outside. Now, if that's true, it's a scandal. Today, the police called a press conference to explain all of this. Victor Escalon with Texas DPS began by explaining that it might be just a rumor that parents were urging police to go inside the building. Watch.  

Oh, it's a rumor. Except it's on video, so it's not at all a rumor. It's a fact. Now, that officer did admit that there was no school resource officer after all. The one we were told had ""engaged"" the gunman didn't exist. Watch.  

So the point is not to point fingers or blame people. Nobody wants a school shooting. Everyone's heart is broken by it, but the authorities are not allowed to lie to us in the aftermath of an event like this and our federal officials are not allowed to take an event like this, ignore the facts, and then use it to take our constitutional rights away. So, what are the facts? Well, here's the news story from Texas DPS. At 11:28 a.m., the shooter crashed his truck outside. He then pulled a gun and began shooting indiscriminately at two people at a funeral home. That confirms what the witness, Carranza, said. He also shot the school building.  

During that time, as you'd expect, people were calling the police. 12 minutes later, at 11:40 a.m., the shooter went inside the building. How did that happen? Then 4 minutes after that, the police finally went inside the building. So, in all there was a 16-minute gap until the police showed up and responded. So why did that take so long? That is a fair question. In fact, it's a critical question. Even at the Parkland School shooting, when police staged outside, students were being murdered, police wound up inside the building 11 minutes after the shooter, but in this case, it was 16 minutes. Why was that? We have a right to know, but today, police wouldn't say.  

So the second the shooting starts anywhere, at any time, things get very confusing. They used to call it the fog of war. It's entirely real. It's hard to figure out exactly what happened when people start getting killed. But on the big questions, it's very obvious immediately. Was there a school resource officer who exchanged fire with the gunman?  

That's not something you would imagine. That either happened or it didn't and you would know right away if it happened or it didn't. It didn't happen, but they said it did happen. That's a lie. Why did they lie? Police did say that officers went inside the school for 4 minutes after the suspect, but then they were treated outside the school and then police did not reenter the school for another hour. During that time, they say they were waiting for backup, including for some reason for multiple crisis negotiators. Watch.  

Now, no matter how pro law enforcement you are – and we are – there's only so much B.S. you can take in the face of a tragedy like this. ""We're waiting for specialized equipment?"" You have an 18-year-old with a firearm and little kids being killed. What kind of specialty equipment do you need? Negotiators, really? As children are being murdered? One 11-year-old child says she smeared herself with a friend's blood to convince the gunman she had already been shot to death.  

Another fourth-grader who survived the shooting said that police told kids inside to call out for help while the shooter was still shooting. Then the gunman killed a student who followed police instructions and called out for help. So, if you're wondering why police waited an hour for negotiators to talk to a gunman who's indiscriminately murdering children, you're not the only one. They were asked about this at the briefing today. Was the door really barricaded or was it just locked? Police wouldn't respond to a simple question like that. Watch.  

So, two days after this massacre, authorities are slowly admitting that everything they told us was, in fact, untrue. There was no school resource officer. They're not even sure how the door was barricaded. These matter, these questions. If you wanted to stop mass shootings in the future, figuring out how this happened would be the place to start, but of course, there's nothing in Joe Biden's latest executive order on policing in the memory of Saint George Floyd that addresses anything related to the shooting. And nothing under consideration for Mitch McConnell who tells you he cares about the facts above all will do anything to punish police officers who hide children die because the point of this is not to protect children. 

Obviously, you may figured it out, it's to blame you for what happened in Uvalde because you dare to exercise your constitutional rights and if you do dare to exercise your constitutional rights, according to MSNBC, you're complicit in .  

  

These ghouls drawing politically convenient conclusions, accusing people who have no connection whatsoever to this massacre, of murder, all on the basis of no evidence, and then when the evidence emerges and it doesn't comport with the politically convenient story they want to tell, they simply ignore it.

But the rest of us should not ignore it. We should not avert our gaze. We should demand the truth. We should demand to know what happened. The children who are murdered deserve at least that.

When was the last time you heard a Democratic politician propose a solution to a problem — no matter what the problem is —that didn't make the  more powerful? Ponder that for a moment. Let's say, for example, that you really believe global warming was an existential threat to humanity and that rising carbon dioxide levels were causing global warming. What would you do to fix it?  

Well, you might think back to 10th grade biology class CO2. CO2, hmm. Don't trees consume huge amounts of CO2 for photosynthesis? Quick Google check. Why, yes, they do. So, how about we plant a whole lot more trees all across the country and across the world? That seems like a natural solution with lots of upsides. Trees are beautiful. It might help . Oh, but no. There's a problem with that idea. Planting more trees might help solve climate change, but it definitely will not enrich your donors. Trees are cheap. It's hard to make money from trees. And worse than that, trees are impossible to regulate. Once you plant trees, they grow by themselves. They do not need federal help.  

Trees definitely will not make you more powerful. So instead, here's an idea. Let's invest trillions of dollars of other people's money in batteries and wind farms and electric school buses. That way, Democratic politicians get fingertip control over the entire  and all of their friends get rich. Sounds perfect. Let's go with that idea.

That's how Democratic politicians think, every one of them. So, it probably should not surprise you that Elizabeth Warren has a brand-new plan for  and naturally, it goes without saying, that plan would give Elizabeth Warren a lot more control over you and over the United States.

Well, hold on a minute, you may be wondering, why should  have control over anything? Elizabeth Warren isn't very bright. She's never created anything. In fact, she's a proven liar. This is a person who exploited the suffering of American Indians to get a job promotion. ""The Trail of Tears means I need tenure."" Ok, so in every possible way, Elizabeth Warren is mediocre. Yet—and here's the catch—she's also a U.S. senator and that means she has power.  

Warren's latest plan to make herself more powerful is called the . This bill would allow Elizabeth Warren to decide what things cost in the United States. So, let's say you're paying $6 a gallon for gas (and you may be) the obvious solution to that, in fact, the only solution to that is to make more gasoline because if there is more of something, it will cost less. That's not just basic economics, though it is. It's also a law of nature. It never changes, but Elizabeth Warren wants the opposite. She does not want more gas. In fact, she's worked hard to prevent the United States from producing more gasoline and that's the main reason it's so expensive. 

What Elizabeth Warren wants instead is control over gasoline and over everything else, and this bill will give it to her. See how this works? And this is why the Biden administration has shut down oil and gas leases in the middle of an energy crisis and not just that, they're crushing refineries. According to one analysis by Hot Air, ""Seven American refineries, which formerly processed 806,000 barrels of oil per day, have gone offline. Some simply shut down, while others were being converted to biofuels like ethanol, to meet the demands of the environmental lobby. These losses have left the United States with 124 operating oil refineries. That is 10% fewer refineries for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel than we had in 2016, even as demand has continued to increase."" 

So, you see this is going. No more oil or gas for you and that's why you can't afford to fill your tank. Instead, the Biden administration is demanding that states build wind turbines that sound good, but unfortunately don't actually work. Last year, we went to Texas to see this firsthand. Here's a clip from our documentary on the tragic buffoonery of wind power.  

So, the point of an energy grid is to produce and transmit energy. It has only one purpose and that purpose is being  and by Wall Street, in favor of green energy, in favor of windmills that don't actually work. And as a result of that, we're facing the . We don't have electricity anymore. It's a first-world country. But Elizabeth Warren has a fix for that: ""It shall be unlawful for a person to sell or offer for sale a good or services at an unconscionably excessive price during an exceptional market shock, regardless of the person's position in the supply chain or distribution network.""  

So, the argument here, this is Elizabeth Warren's argument, the economy has been in a period of exceptional market shock since the pandemic began. Therefore, prices set by every industry across the country would fall under the regulatory authority of who? Elizabeth Warren. Most of the price gouging bills are limited to specific areas during natural disasters, but this one is not. It's economy wide and it's forever. 

Now, the question is, how exactly does Elizabeth Warren define ""unconscionably excessive prices"" because they're not defined in the legislation? So, it turns out the definition is up to...can you guess? Elizabeth Warren.  

Any business with gross annual revenues over 100 grand a year, that means pretty much everybody in the country, must now obey Elizabeth Warren. That means Elizabeth Warren read the power to say set the price of diesel fuel. That's what we use to fuel trucks that transport virtually everything that you buy or consume. The entire . As CBS reported recently, diesel prices are getting close to the point where truckers can't work anymore. Watch.  

So, most projections suggest that this (and by ""this,"" we mean the price of energy) is going to get worse) and that's exactly, of course, what Elizabeth Warren is counting on—your suffering. She hopes Americans get so desperate that they go to her to set the price of diesel along with everything else that's bought or sold in the United States economy and when that happens, what happens? Interesting question. So, at this point, a lot of money is floating around the U.S. economy and that's because of government spending. Federal Reserve prints money, it goes to the banks and then it filters down to Wall Street and they buy bigger houses and yet the same time, supplies of essential goods are very limited. 

So, when you impose price controls in that kind of environment – Anyone? Anyone?-- bidding wars start and prices go up even higher. As the economist Alan Cole put it recently, you'll inevitably get a ""scalper’s paradise."" Government imposed prices will be low, so they'll sell out fast, of course. Then you get a black market. We don't have to guess because this has happened in every controlled economy in history. The Bolsheviks learned this early when they imposed price controls. 

So, what do you do next if you're the government imposing these controls? Well, you crack down on scalpers and that's what Elizabeth Warren's bill would do.  

So, you get a lot more law enforcement activity, a lot of people going to jail, but you also get what the economist Gregory Grossman calls ""the second economy."" People do anything they can to get the government-approved lower price. The Soviets traded favors and established protection rackets. They called the system ""blat"", which translated from the Polish, meant someone who provides cover. 

What you get is corruption. Corruption is the inevitable result of price controls. Even the Soviets learned this after almost 70 years. It's why Gorbachev abandoned price controls in the 1990s. Nicolas Maduro, though a pretty rigorous Marxist, also abandoned price controls in Venezuela. He did that three years ago. In the 1970s, Richard Nixon also realized  – Can you imagine –  price controls don't work, but only after he froze all prices and wages in the United States and that eventually led to a massive spike in demand and double-digit inflation. 

So, people who don't understand basic economic principles probably shouldn't fool around with the economy, but they can never control themselves and that's why some of the biggest figures in the Democratic Party right now want to repeat mistakes we have seen countless times, not just Elizabeth Warren. 

 It's the supposedly moderate Bob Casey here; Sheldon Whitehouse, who is not very bright; and Bernie Sanders, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Tammy Duckworth and Dianne Feinstein. They're all on board with this bill. 

Then in the House you've got Jerry Nadler, David Cicilline of Rhode Island (the former mob lawyer), Katie Porter of California, Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, Bobby Rush of Chicago. They've all co-sponsored the legislation.  

So they're hoping, as they do, that you won't open Wikipedia to find out what happened when every other country in history tried this. They definitely don't want you looking into the history of the Soviet Union. That's why that history is no longer taught in schools. Instead, they want you to watch reports like this and in fear, give them total control over your economy.  

So, we're not shilling for big business here. We don't work for Joe Biden. We don't have to. In fact, we're often nightly critical of big business, but let's be honest for a second. Does any serious person actually believe that hamburger and chicken patty manufacturers are holding back supplies of their products because they're greedy?

That's not what's happening. We wish it were what's happening because you could probably fix that, but that's what they’re telling you is happening and they're telling you that, so you'll believe it. They want you to believe that the baby formula shortage isn't about supply, it''s about pricing. Unfortunately, that's just not true. Here's NBC with the latest figures on the shortage.  

Oh. So, the key line was the last line. The out-of-stock rate is now 50%. So they just don't have the product because companies generally, if they have the product, are eager to sell the product because they're in the business of selling products to make money. But unfortunately, if you have no grounding in economics at all, not even theoretical but practical, like if your whole life has consisted of lying to large crowds to get elected, to print more money, to pay yourself, give yourself the most generous retirement in the United States, you probably don't know how anything works, and that would describe most leaders in the Democratic Party.  

So their solution, not surprisingly, is the Soviets' solution. It will make the problem worse, but it will make them more powerful. Oh, do you not like that? Oh, we're sorry. We'd love to hear your complaints, but we're not available at the moment. We've flown private to a .

669	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-leaders-disarm-decriminalizing-serious-crimes	2022-06-01 22:49:00	Tucker Carlson: While leaders disarm you, they are busy decriminalizing serious crimes | Fox News	"WARNING—Graphic footage: Fox News host voices his concerns over countries disarming their citizens on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We have not brought you enough on this story that you may know from its outlines. For the past two months, 25 million people in , one of the biggest cities in the world, have been trapped inside their homes.  

On the basis of what it claims is a , but it's clearly purely political, the Chinese government has locked them in – can't get out. Anyone suspected of being sick has been shipped to a squalid quarantine camp, sometimes without running water, and then to make the humiliation complete, police collected household pets, tore them from their owner's hands, and beat them to death in the streets, claiming that dogs and cats somehow spread disease.  

Anyone who complained about this got a very clear answer from the government, which was broadcast at full volume from drones circling overhead. They said, ""Control your soul's desire for freedom."" So, people did. They had no choice. That's what life is like in an authoritarian society and not just in China, also in New Zealand. Less than a year ago, the left-wing New Zealand government shut down the entire country over a single COVID case. ""Don't talk to your neighbors,"" commanded the prime minister. ""Keep to your bubbles."" 

In neighboring Australia, they did pretty much the same thing. Police in Australia beat a man for daring to have a cigarette outside his own apartment. Now, that may all seem horrifying to you, but public health authorities here loved it. They looked on in envy. Unfortunately, as Tony Fauci recently explained to me, NBC, ""You'd never be able to implement measures like that here in the United States,"" and that's true. You'd hope. But why couldn't you? Why couldn't you do that here? 

Well,  didn't say it out loud, but if you think about it for a minute, it's pretty obvious. What do all those other countries have in common: China, New Zealand, Australia? Different populations, different languages, different forms of government, but all of them have disarmed their populations. In those countries, ordinary people are defenseless and the government knows it.  

China, of course, was the first to confiscate privately held firearms. It happened more than 50 years ago. Political power grows from the barrel of a gun, Chairman Mao famously observed, and he wanted all of that power for himself, so he got it. In 1996, Australia followed after a mass shooting committed by a mentally disabled man. Sound familiar? The Australian government, in the aftermath of that, declared that self-defense was no longer a legitimate reason to own a firearm and the government confiscated hundreds of thousands of guns from law-abiding citizens. That's what happened.  

In 2019, after yet another mass shooting by a crazy person, neighboring New Zealand did pretty much the same thing. So now in all three of those countries, China, Australia and New Zealand, firearms now registered and licensed by the government and permitted only for hunting and sports shooting. . 

Last week's , occurred more than 2,000 miles from Canada. You wouldn't think it was connected in any way to Canada, but that country's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, saw an opening to repeat what is now a highly familiar script. On Monday, Trudeau announced that because a deranged teenager in the U.S. had committed an act of violence, Canadians would no longer be allowed to defend themselves. Watch. 

""There's no reason that anyone in Canada should need guns in their everyday lives."" That's the word from the Botoxed dictator to the north. That means anyone in Canada apart from Justin Trudeau because guns, it turns out, are a huge part of Justin Trudeau's everyday life. Much more than your life. At all times, Justin Trudeau is surrounded by firearms, automatic rifles, extended magazines, what we call weapons of war and Justin Trudeau always will be surrounded by weapons of war. Even if he succeeds in confiscating every last privately held firearm in the nation of Canada, Justin Trudeau will never disarm his own bodyguards.  

Why? Because he understands perfectly well that guns are the key to his power. So actually, in one of those ironies we've become very familiar with recently, no one loves guns more than Justin Trudeau. In the rest of Canada, in point of fact, guns aren't much of an issue. There were just 16 homicides in the million-person city of Ottawa over all of last year, and half of those involve knives and fists, not guns. One of them is a self-defense case.  

So, guns are not killing a lot of Canadians. What is killing a lot of Canadians are drug lords. More than 5,000 Canadians died last year from opioids alone, mostly fentanyl. How is Justin Trudeau responding to this? Well, days ago, he announced that he is legalizing fentanyl along with cocaine and methamphetamine in Canada's third largest providence, British Columbia. 

This is a place, this is a province, where more than 165 people died last month from drug ODs. By comparison, in 2020, in the entire nation of Canada, 23 people died per month in acts involving a firearm. So why, if you were concerned about public health, would you ban firearms, but legalize fentanyl? Fentanyl is what people are dying from, not guns. How does that make sense? Well, it only makes sense if your goal is to keep the population weak and vulnerable, even if it kills them and that would explain why Trudeau is not stopping with British Columbia. He also has said he's working with Toronto and Edmonton to legalize fentanyl there as well. 

Meanwhile, at the same time, also under the guise of public health, Trudeau has just announced an indefinite extension of his country's travel ban for millions of Canadian citizens, just like in China, just like in Cuba. So, if you haven't taken Justin Trudeau's totally ineffective yet still mandatory COVID vax, you can't leave your own country. You also can't travel internally by plane or train. This is not a public health measure, of course. It's a show of force from a tyrant. But if you don't like it tough, there's nothing you can do. Why? Because you've been disarmed.  

You can have all the fentanyl you want, but you can't defend yourself. And it's not just gun confiscation, as you heard, it's magazine confiscation and as always, our authorities, mostly in the Democratic Party, are taking very close notes when they watch Justin Trudeau speak. Joe Biden just announced that 9 mm ammunition is, ""high caliber,"" which makes anyone who understands guns laugh, and should therefore be banned. Nine-millimeter, the single most common pistol round sold in the United States by far should be banned, says Joe Biden.  

In New York, the unelected governor, Kathy Hochul, just announced legislation to, ""eliminate the grandfathering of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices."" That means your legal magazine is now illegal. Possessing it is now a crime. It wasn't yesterday. It is today. That's the word from the unelected governor of New York, because that's democracy. She also plans to create a licensing requirement for all semiautomatic weapons. That's not just the scary-looking ones you see on TV. That's all semiautomatic weapons, including your deer rifle.  

While they disarm you, as in Canada, our leaders are busy decriminalizing serious crimes, ones that actually hurt you. For example, according to the Seattle Times, police in Seattle are no longer investigating rape. Yes, they are ""no longer assigning detectives this new year, to cases with adult victims."" That's rape victims. They'll have to do without.  

If any of the people in charge wanted this to be a safer country, they wouldn't have caused the current crime wave in the first place. They would not have defunded police. They wouldn't be encouraging open-air drug markets in our cities. They wouldn't be sending crack pipes to addicts. But they're not worried about the public health at all. What they're worried about is public resistance to their policies. Disarming the population ends that resistance. 

They're very concerned because they know they rule illegitimately that the population will rise up. That probably has not occurred to you. It's definitely occurred to them, and it's occurred to the corporate media they control, whose job it is to push their power grabs, and they would very much like a Canada/China-style gun ban in this country. Watch them salivate.  

We need only look south of the border to know that if we do not take action firmly and rapidly, it gets worse and worse.  

Canada looks down on America, informs the Rachel Maddow impersonators on MSNBC. Notice they used to brag about the Canadian health care system. ""It's so great. Why don't we emulate it?"" You ever heard that recently. Why is that? Because Canadians fly here for serious operations and the truth is, in Canada, as in the United States, the people you just saw on television, the people who are formulating these restrictions, these gun grabs, these violations of your constitutional rights, will never, under any circumstances, give up their own weapons of war.  

They just want to make it harder for you to defend yourself. Now, as is the case with all of these laws, from cigarette taxes to gun laws, the poor get hurt the most. Charlie LeDuff and Steve Neavling, two journalists in Michigan, found that police response times in poor neighborhoods are about twice as long as they are in rich neighborhoods.  

Oh, so if anyone needs the power to defend himself, it's people who live in poor neighborhoods and those happen to be the same people the Democratic Party claims to care about, but they don't seem to actually care and that's why  from the homes of law-abiding people. Here he is.  

""Shouldn't be able to keep them."" Beto O'Rourke is deciding what rights you should have. Beto O'Rourke, who's actually never had a job ever, who lives on inherited money, who's not even very smart, is telling you what the parameters of your Godgiven rights enshrined in our Constitution ought to be. I don't think you should have that right. Buzz off, pal. 

Now, you'd think Republican office holders exist to push back against this and to defend the Bill of Rights. Isn't that their job? Is not what you voted for them? Oh, no. They're playing along just to show they care. 

So, this weekend, one of the weakest of them all, really an embarrassment to the state of Arkansas, the governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, noted ally to the trans community, said he's open to more restrictions on legal rifles. Watch Asa Hutchinson.  

So, you got to wonder, since Asa Hutchinson's thinking to himself, ""How do I impress the CNN anchor? I'm not some troglodyte from Conway, Arkansas. I get what I need to do. I'm a responsible adult. I've been to the Aspen Institute. I'd go to Davos if they invited me."" But you've got to wonder how many of his constituents agree with him.  

Oh, probably about zero. He doesn't care. So, you can see where this is moving. They're going to try and take your guns away. What will happen when they do? Will it be a safer country? Have they been good at disarming criminals? No. It turns out you will be completely dependent upon them for your safety. What will that look like? Well, we could ask the woman who called the police from the grocery store in Buffalo two weeks ago when a lunatic walked in and started murdering people. She called 911. And what happened? The 911 operator hung up on her. 

Or we could ask the parents of those kids in Uvalde. The police just showed up and stood outside. Watch.  

  

So,it's not an attack on police. We defend the police and we'll continue to do that, including the ones in Uvalde. No doubt they're mostly good and decent and patriotic people, but the truth about all police, about all government workers, about everyone outside your family is they're never going to care about your family as much as you do because it's your family, not theirs.  

You will lay down your life to defend your children. Why would they? They're not their children. It's not an attack. It's just an obvious observation and a lot of times the truth is, since we've defunded the police across the country, they don't even show up because there aren't enough of them to show up. So, where there were, where were the police, by the way, when this woman got stabbed in broad daylight in New York City? Look at this footage. It's from May 22 in Brownsville, Brooklyn. There were no cops there. The guy just walked up and stabbed her.  

These kind of attacks happen a lot and they are particularly common in the very cities that have disarmed lawabiding gun owners. The footage you're seeing now is from the Bronx in March. Thugs robbed a young woman at gunpoint, then turned the gun at her three-year-old boy's head. The woman was taking her son, who has autism, to pre-K. Where were the police? Well, they weren't there. They've been defunded, but if they haven't been defunded, they can't be everywhere. If you want to defend yourself, you're going to have to do it yourself. That's just the truth. 

By contrast, a woman in Charleston stopped a mass shooter the other day. She didn't call the police. He showed up with an AR-15 and said he's going to kill everybody. You know what she did? She shot him to death.  

Oh. So, what's the headline from that story? He was not allowed to be in possession of a gun. It was against the law for him to have a gun. But it looks like gun laws did nothing to deter the lunatic with the rifle when he started shooting strangers and neither did the police because they weren't there and no police officer could get there in time to save the lives of the people present.  

The only reason they're still alive is because a woman in the crowd, a citizen, had a gun, and she used it to defend herself and the rest of the people there. Why is she not a hero? The truth is, any government that tries to make you more dependent, any government that tries to make you less self-sufficient, is by definition a malicious government. They are not on your side. They're trying to hurt you.

670	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-biden-spoke-need-disarm-population	2022-06-02 22:36:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden just spoke about the need to disarm the population | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on President Biden's speech addressing gun violence on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Facing almost certain defeat for his party in the midterm elections five months from now, Joe Biden has become desperate. 

He's decided to leverage the  last week for political advantage. He just spoke at some length from the White House about the need to disarm the population. We're going to spare you all of it. We've taken a few select soundbites that sum up the president's message. Here they are.  

So, to summarize the president's remarks tonight, your constitutional rights are not absolute. But in taking them away, we're not actually taking away your rights, we're protecting children. To which you might ask, am I a threat to children? That question is never answered by the president.  

The point of this, of course, is to disarm people who did not vote for Joe Biden and that is why, simultaneous with this, this effort to recategorize the guns in your closet as felonies, Democrats have been failing to  where most of the crime is and if you're at all confused about whether the effort here is selective, if this is enforcement only at certain people, you'll notice the president never mentioned the apparent federal gun felony his own son committed when he lied on a federal background form when he bought a handgun. Didn't mention that, Justice Department has completely ignored it. 

Instead, Biden's fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives spent the day debating ways to disarm you, Americans, who've committed no crime at all and want only to protect themselves and their families. Democrats plan to criminalize possession what they're calling large capacity ammunition feeding devices. That is specifically any magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.  

Well, as it turns out, that is most magazines in the United States. Tens of millions of Americans right now have so-called high-capacity magazines in their homes. They're not militia members. They're not gun nuts. They are normal people and the reason they have them is because most modern handguns and rifles use that type of magazine, the kind that Joe Biden is telling you is threatening and esoteric. And these same firearms, the ones in your house right now, will not accept the kind of diminished magazines Joe Biden is demanding you use, and that means, in effect, all of those guns will be banned.  

Which gun specifically? Well, for example, the Glock 19, probably the most popular handgun in the United States. The Glock 19 comes from the manufacturer with a 15-round magazine. Now, the Glock 19 is not an especially scary firearm. It's a workman-like pistol. If you have any interest in guns at all, you probably already own one. But under this bill, the Glock 19 would be banned, illegal, a felony sitting on your bedside table and so would many other popular firearms in the United States.  

Now, this is about saving the children, Joe Biden just told us. But how many lives would this new law save? Well, we know the answer: zero, not one. We know that because there is precisely no evidence at all and never has been that larger magazines somehow inspire mass shootings, but of course, saving lives is not the point of this. Disarming you is the point. Florida Congressman Greg Steube tried to explain that at a hearing today of the House Judiciary Committee. Watch how this unfolded.  

So, you heard a voice in the background. Greg Steube obviously knows his way around firearms. That was his gun, but offcamera, you heard Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas interrupting Greg Steube to tell him how to handle the firearm in his own home.

So, is Sheila Jackson Lee a gun instructor now? What does she know about firearms? Well, glad you asked. Sheila Jackson Lee is the person who once explained to us that AR 15s shoot 50 caliber rounds and weigh more than ""t10 boxes,"" whatever that means. Sheila Jackson Lee knows literally nothing about firearms and yet she plans, without shame, to regulate them, but only regulate your guns. Sheila Jackson Lee has no intention of disarming her own bodyguards, for example, or her own constituents. The Democrats' bill contains an explicit exemption for bodyguards.  

Even Sheila Jackson Lee understands the people protecting her family may need a lot more than ten rounds and most of them carry that. As The Washington Post put it, ""American law enforcement officers ubiquitously carry handguns with more than ten rounds of ammunition and often more than 15. It is also why the rifles typically have 20 or 30 round magazines, not ten."" 

Now, why would Sheila Jackson Lee's bodyguards need all of those bullets? Why would anybody need all of those bullets, as Chuck Schumer often asks rhetorically? And the answer, of course, is because it's a dangerous world and if you're serious about protecting the people you love, you'll be serious about the firearm you carry, but it turns out, and we know this for a fact now, Democrats are not serious about protecting you or your family. And that's why they defunded your police and called you a racist for complaining about it as your city collapsed.  

What they care about deeply, what they care about more than anything at all, is protecting themselves and that's why their bodyguards will continue to get any kind of magazines they want and what they want are high-capacity magazines. Democrats spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how to ban what Joe Biden has called ""ghost guns."" Ghost guns, they're scary. Well, several states, it turns out, never tried to ban ghost guns, but every state that has run into the same problem. No one can say what a ghost gun is. It's a made-up term. It has no meaning.  

As a judge in Nevada put it late last year when he struck down a ban on so-called ghost guns, ""Nevadans would face the risk of discriminatory enforcement by police and prosecutors alike as they, in their sole discretion and without guidance, could label almost anything an unfinished frame or receiver if it in any way resembles a firearm's undefined frame or low receiver.""

In other words, any gun could be a ghost gun if Democratic operatives say it is, and of course, that's the way they like it.  

The bill before Congress defines ghost gun as a firearm, including certain firearm parts that does not have a unique serial number engraved by a licensed manufacturer. Ok, but the question is, which part of a firearm should require engraved serial numbers? That's the question. On that question hangs whether or not your possession of this object is a felony or legal. Now, according to the bill, any ""essential component of the firearm"" would require an engraved serial number, but here's the point. Merrick Garland gets to make the call.  

This bill grants Merrick Garland, who was a craven and ruthless partisan – we know that for a fact at this point – grants Merrick Garland the sole authority to define what an essential component is and if Merrick Garland decides you've got a ""essential component"" that does not have an engraved serial number, you're going to jail. See how this works? 

So once again, the point is not to stop school shootings. There's never been a school shooting with a so-called ghost gun. If you were interested in stopping school shootings and all of us should be, you would take a serious look at why they happened in the first place. What do the people who commit them have in common? But no one in Congress, particularly the Democratic side, is doing that.  

So, this isn't an attempt to stop school shootings. It's not an attempt to make this a safer country. This is exactly what it looks like: The beginning of a plan to confiscate and criminalize firearms in the hands of the law-abiding in this country and if you doubt that, no, that Nancy Pelosi has already announced she's going to introduce legislation banning so-called assault weapons next week. 

Oh, assault weapons. What's an assault weapon? Any gun that Nancy Pelosi's bodyguards have that you should not be allowed to have and there's also a new ""red flag law"" in progress. Now, that law would allow the government to seize firearms from anybody it wants, whether or not they committed a crime.  

Now, under our current system, you have to be convicted in order to be punished. But under the red flag laws, if someone doesn't like the cut of your jib, you lose your constitutional rights. Now, that's baldly unconstitutional, and you know it is because Democrats are suddenly talking about packing the Supreme Court in order to make it law. Watch.  

""In our communities."" Really? What's the murder rate in your community, pal, and what exactly have you done to make it better? Nothing. Mondaire Jones wants power. They all do and to that end, he wants to end the filibuster, destroy the entire judiciary to ""end gun violence."" A move like that raises a lot of questions. For example, does Mondaire Jones have any idea what he's talking about? Like the details because you are a lawmaker. Fox's Hillary Vaughn caught up with him today. She wanted to know what weapons of war he intends to ban. This is a revealing exchange. Watch this. Here's what he said.  

So, yes, Mondaire Jones, just explained, yeah, all semiautomatic weapons, which Hillary Vaugh says, yeah, handguns? Yeah, handguns. So, you want to take everyone's handguns away? No, handguns wouldn't qualify as assault weapons, even though he just defined assault weapons as any ""semiautomatic weapon.""  

So clearly, Mondaire Jones knows what Hillary Vaughn was trying to tell him, that most firearms in this country, including most handguns, are, ""semiautomatic weapons,"" including 22 calibers that aren't causing a ton of school shootings, but when Hillary Vaughn points this out, Mondaire Jones runs away and probably not back to his district to lower the murder rate. He just didn't want to get into details.  

What are we looking at here? Well, today a guy on Twitter called Spike Cohen summed it up pretty nicely. Here's what he wrote, ""The U.S. government has been arming Ukraine because their allies. The U.S. government has been seeking to disarm Russia because they're opponents. In totally unrelated news, the U.S. government seeks to disarm you."" 

Well, exactly. That's the framing. That's the truth. Anyone who tries to , by definition, considers you an enemy. That's what you do to your enemies. You disarm them, your friends, your allies, your children, people you love. Why would you want to prevent them from defending themselves? You never would.

You certainly wouldn't scream at them from the podium about how they're killing children if they want to protect their own families. That's what you do to your enemies. And yet somehow a lot of Republicans, particularly in leadership, Mitch McConnell specifically, but a lot of others – Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – don't seem to understand this.

Or maybe they do.

671	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-pete-buttigieg-disgrace-should-resign	2022-06-03 22:10:00	Tucker Carlson: Pete Buttigieg is a disgrace and should resign | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson shreds Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg after voicing his concerns about fuel costs and air travel on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Let's say just for the sake of a mind experiment, that you're the secretary of transportation for the United States of America. That's a big job, but what would you do all day? Well, that's a pretty easy one, because every secretary of transportation has the same two concerns, the overriding concerns, and despite what they may tell you, neither one of these concerns has anything to do with systemic racism.  

So, your first concern would be the . Diesel fuel is what makes transportation possible in this country. Virtually everything you buy in America arrived by diesel engine. Our entire trucking fleet runs on diesel; so does every single freight locomotive in the United States. If diesel prices get too high, transportation and you have the secretary of transportation, stops. The price of nearly everything becomes unaffordable. So, inflation is directly connected to transportation and transportation requires diesel.  

It turns out that diesel fuel prices are the key to a lot of the American economy and you would know that. Your second concern, if you were transportation secretary, would be domestic air travel. This is a huge country. It's far too big a country not to have reliable commercial flights from one place to another. Businesses depend on the airlines and so do families. For generations, they've been able to depend on the airlines. America has had the most efficient air service in the world. Planes land on time. They don't crash. So, maintaining that system of air travel is probably the top concern of the United States Transportation Department.  

So, that's what you would be worried about if you were the secretary—diesel and airlines —and yet, remarkably, in less than a year and a half under Joe Biden, both of these things, fuel costs and air travel have gone dramatically in the wrong direction. The price of diesel is now hit its highest price ever recorded in history. The national average is up 70% since just last year. It's now $5.53 a gallon. That's terrible for truckers, but it's also terrible for you. It means you're paying much more for everything you buy. Watch. 

The cost of a gallon of diesel fuel rose by more than a dollar in just Biden's first year as president. That was the largest annual increase in over a decade. Why is this happening? Well, because Joe Biden made it happen. This was intentional. It's a product of his clampdown on domestic energy production and especially of his lunatic war against Vladimir Putin, the war that both parties seem to be in favor of, but that is crushing the United States. Biden's sanctions of Russia have been especially counterproductive.  

So, back in February, you may remember that Joe Biden pledged to destroy the Russian economy. ""Let's make them poor."" Of course, this is in retaliation for installing Donald Trump as president. So, what happened next? Well, four months later, the opposite has happened. The ruble is now at a four-year-high. Thanks, Joe Biden. Russia has the largest gold deserves on planet Earth. Meanwhile, in this country, you can't afford gasoline. 

Oh, so the opposite from what Joe Biden predicted happened. What's his explanation for that? Explanation? ""Sorry, it was an act of God. I can't do anything about it."" Watch.  

Oh, there's nothing we can do. Oh, well, you could push to an , which Biden is single handedly prolonging. You could force your client state Ukraine to come to the table. Both countries, Russia and Ukraine, want to do that. The only reason this war continues is because the White House is forcing it to continue and then, by the way, you could stop shutting down energy pipelines. You could stop canceling oil drilling. But, of course, Biden doesn't plan to do that. It would help America too much.  

Instead, he's  and then pleading with the Saudis. Wasn't it just the other day that the United States was energy independent? Yes, but now we're begging dictatorships to sell us oil, but it won't be enough. Industry officials are predicting shortages very soon.  

""I wouldn't be surprised to see diesel being rationed on the East Coast this summer,"" said John Catsimatidis, a CEO of the United Refining Company. ""Right now, inventories are low and we may see a shortage in the coming months."" 

What would that look like here? It would be ugly and again, it has worked to Russia's advantage. Even The New York Times was forced to acknowledge that this week: ""China and India could be protected from some of the burden of higher oil prices because Russia is offering them discounted oil... Russia has become the second-biggest oil supplier to India."" 

How is this a good thing for the United States? No, it's the opposite. It is a disaster and this is the first crisis you would expect the secretary of transportation to be on top of. We can't afford gasoline, but Russia now has so much oil, it's selling it at a discount to our main global adversary, China. That seems bad, but it's only one crisis that the transportation secretary has on his plate.

The second is domestic air travel. It has become totally unreliable. Tried to fly anywhere recently? It's like traveling in India in 1985. You have no idea if the plane is going to arrive or leave. No one will give you a straight answer on that and there is nothing you can do. It is falling apart and anyone who's tried to go anywhere, particularly this weekend, can tell you that.  

Oh, staffing has been a challenge. Why is that? Maybe because Joe Biden forced the airlines to fire employees that didn't want his ineffective shot, and so the system fell apart. There aren't enough people to run it. Airlines can no longer provide on-time flights.

So, guess what rich people were doing? Well, rather than work to fix the system, they're just opting out completely. They're flying private. According to latest earnings report from the charter airline company Wheels Up, in March of 2020, they had 6,300 active members. That number has now nearly doubled to 12,400. And it's not just Wheels Up. That's the trend across the industry.  

According to private jet data provided by airports, there was a total in April of 2019 of 389,000 private jet flights in this country. Again, April 2019. In April this year, there are more than 475,000. Because everyone's so much richer after the COVID lockdowns? No, because if you can afford to fly private and get out of our crumbling commercial air system, you will, but if you can't afford it, good luck getting where you're going. Probably going to spend some unscheduled time in an airport.  

For the first three months of 2022, major airlines in this country reported a cancelation rate that is 50% higher than it was for the same period in 2019, 50% higher. Good work, Joe Biden. In the first quarter of this year, the Department of Transportation received more than 13,000 complaints about airline service. That's up 330% from the first quarter of 2019. What a disaster

And not only are you unlikely to get where you're going on time, you're also going to pay a lot more for your ticket.  

The average price of a domestic roundtrip flight is now more than $400. That's up 70% since January. In January, the average cost was $236. It's up 40% from this time last year when the average price was $288. And that's gas prices. Airlines are actually cutting routes because it's no longer profitable for them because gas is too high. Again, thanks, Joe Biden. JetBlue is killing 27 regular routes this summer, height of the travel season. Delta is getting rid of 100.  

So, what is the , doing about this? Working feverishly to fix it? No. Working feverishly on the equity agenda, their only concern. So, vaccine mandates sent the airlines into turmoil without saving a single life. Now, the administration is demanding that airlines hire fewer White pilots and fewer White air traffic controllers, because that was the real problem, because skin color somehow is related to aeronautical skill. And airlines are doing it. United has announced that 50% of its company's pilots will be ""women or people of color"" over the next decade. 

Why should you care what the color of your pilot is? What does it have to do with anything? No one explains, but the New York Times is thrilled by it. They just published this triumphant feature piece, ""The End of the All-Male, All-White Cockpit"" which apparently served us so badly.

Again, no one explains why you should care about the race or gender of your airline pilots. Everybody cares about their skill except the New York Times and the Biden White House. By the way, at the same time, the White House is doing all it can to keep fuel prices high. Biden is just pushing the EU to stop buying Russian oil. It's payback for getting Trump elected, but the effect is to guarantee higher prices on international oil markets, and that means higher prices for you.

So, this is not an accident. They're doing it on purpose. This is the Green New Deal they couldn't get through Congress and the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, the one who owns stock in an electric vehicle manufacturer even after she took her current job, came out and admitted this out loud this week.  

So, what is Pete Buttigieg, who is the transportation secretary, doing about this? Well, in November, he told Americans in rural areas, the poorest parts of this country, to go ahead and buy electric vehicles. Get a Prius even though they cost more than 50 grand.  

In that same month, of course, he reminded us that our highways are racist, ""If an underpass was constructed such that a bus carrying mostly Black and Puerto Rican kids to the beach was designed too low for it to pass by, obviously, that reflects racism, that went into those design choices."" Racist roads. Can you name one? No, of course not, but these are his obsessions. 

More recently, the Transportation Secretary has been telling us about the one thing that's going to fix our high fuel prices and clogged commercial airline travel and that's, of course, abortion. Here he is on June 1st. More abortion. 

Now, that guy is not the secretary of abortion or ladies' rights. That's the secretary of transportation who was lecturing you about abortion, a topic that doesn't really have anything to do with him on any level, even as our transportation systems are falling apart, and that's not an overstatement. He's busy going to policy conferences, telling you the real problem in this country is the Supreme Court ruling on abortion.

Pete Buttigieg is a disgrace. He's not even doing the bare minimum to fulfill his job requirements. Pete Buttigieg should resign, at least.

672	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-peter-navarros-arrest-third-world	2022-06-06 23:49:00	Tucker Carlson: Peter Navarro's arrest is a huge step toward the politics of the third world | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on Peter Navarro's arrest over dispute with January 6 committee on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Peter Navarro is the picture of a law-abiding American citizen. He's a 72-year-old retired business school professor. He's got a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. His most recent job was extremely white collar. He served as the White House trade adviser in the last presidential administration, famous for his tough stance on China.  

He's never been charged with a crime. He's never trafficked fentanyl, for example, from Mexico. In fact, his hobby is yoga and riding his bicycle. In short, Peter Navarro does not seem like a criminal, much less a danger to this nation. And yet last Friday, federal agents arrested Peter Navarro at Reagan National Airport in Washington. They did not call his lawyer, as is customary in cases like this. They didn't even come to his house, which, as it happens, is just feet from the FBI building, and they could have walked, but they didn't.  

Instead, they took down Peter Navarro in public, as you would a fugitive terror mastermind so everyone could see it and learn the lesson they were sending. They handcuffed Peter Navarro. They put him in leg irons, and then they threw him in a cell. He's now facing years in prison. So, what did Peter Navarro do to deserve treatment like this? Well, he resisted a subpoena from the January 6 committee.  is Washington's latest partisan inquisition. It's run by Nancy Pelosi with help from obedient little quislings like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.  

Navarro resisted that subpoena because he had nothing to do with January 6, nothing whatsoever. That's not disputed. Peter Navarro did not break into the Capitol. He didn't encourage anyone else to break into the Capitol. He wasn't even there that day. He had no idea it was going to happen. Again, that's beyond dispute and Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney know that. 

If you really wanted to figure out what happened on January 6, Peter Navarro would be the last person you would talk to. Instead, you'd be talking to Ray Epps and various FBI informants. But finding out what happened on January 6 and why is not the point of the exercise. The point of the exercise is preventing Donald Trump from running for president again. So, in the service of that goal, Pelosi and Liz Cheney demanded that Peter Navarro surrender records of his private conversations with his former boss, President Donald Trump, and when he refused to do that, Congress voted to hold him in contempt in a partisan vote and then Merrick Garland's Justice Department filed criminal charges against Peter Navarro.  

This is not the way civilized countries operate. Just because you control the White House and both houses of Congress, does not mean you get to throw your political opponents behind bars. That's not what we do in America. That's what they do in Haiti, but that's what we're doing now and Peter Navarro was not the first. Biden's Justice Department also arrested former Trump adviser Steve Bannon for a similar fake crime. Steve Bannon is awaiting trial this summer.  

So, this is not something we've seen before. It's a huge step toward the politics of the Third World, but the media whose job you thought of was to push back against power are not. They are, in fact, applauding because it turns out no punishment is too severe for those who disagree with the national news media. Watch them gloat.  

  

So, they really are your enemies. They're not covering the news. They're plotting ways to hurt you. That's true. ""Congressional subpoenas are not optional,"" they lecture you, ""Comply with them or go to jail."" That's the message the lawyers on television are sending. So, let's pretend for a moment that that was true, though it's in fact, not true. If there was, in fact, a law like that for that law to be legitimate, it would have to be like all laws applied equally across the board and no less than the attorney general himself has said that again and again and again.  

""I came to work here,"" he said, ""because we're committed to the rule of law and to seeking equal justice under the law."" That was Merrick Garland in January. ""We conduct every investigation guided by the same norms.""

Now, those are the norms under which this country has lived for 250 years. It's not justice unless it's applied equally to all adult American citizens, period. Anything less than that is, by definition, not justice, but we're getting much less than that and it's very obvious.  

Here's just one example. Ten years ago this month, Congress voted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote, by the way, 17 Democrats to hold Eric Holder, then the attorney general, in criminal contempt of Congress. Holder had refused to turn over documents showing how the Obama administration had armed the Mexican drug cartels. Do you remember that? One of the firearms they sent to Mexico under the so-called ""Fast and Furious"" program was then used to murder a U.S. Border Patrol officer. It was a scandal at the time, in case you don't recall. Watch. 

So, that was a legitimate scandal that implicated the entire U.S. government, people who actually have power, not the retirees sitting in jail because of what they did on January 6, but people with actual power, and Eric Holder was the very center of it, but Holder refused to comply with a subpoena from the Congress. Did the FBI arrest Eric Holder for that, please? It was never even seriously considered.  

Holder asserted executive privilege, the right to have conversations with the executive, the president that are private. He cited the long-standing policy of respecting executive privilege and he got away with it. So, a week ago, Peter Navarro made this exact point. He sued the Justice Department, pushing back against the subpoena, four days before he was arrested and in that suit, Navarro cited policy written by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel. That policy reads this way, ""Since the 1970s, this office has consistently advised that the president and his immediate advisers are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by congressional committee on matters related to their official duties."" 

In other words, if somebody asserts executive privilege, at the very least, Congress doesn't get to arrest them. Before anyone is arrested, they have to go to a judge to rule on whether or not executive privilege is valid in this case and that's exactly what happened in Eric Holder's case. And by the way, the federal judge rejected Eric Holder's executive privilege claim and still, he was not arrested. Why? You know why – ecause he's a leading Democrat. But in Peter Navarro's case, Merrick Garland's DOJ did not even bother to ask a judge. They just arrested Peter Navarro at National Airport.  

So, what we're seeing here isn't really about Peter Navarro or Steve Bannon. What we're seeing is a massive escalation in the use by the Democratic Party of our justice system for partisan revenge. That's exactly what that was. Peter Navarro wouldn't shut up, so they threw him in handcuffs and in fact, at the same moment Peter Navarro was thrown in jail for asserting executive privilege, a Clinton lawyer called Michael Sussman was acquitted by a jury seated by an Obama-appointed judge. Three of the jurors in that case gave money to Hillary Clinton's campaign and not surprisingly, those same jurors declined to punish Michael Sussmann for lying to the FBI to advance the Russia collusion myth that helped Hillary Clinton's campaign. Following all of this?  

How did those jurors get on the jury? How did they stay there?

Now, the FBI pretended to be outraged by the fact that Michael Sussman had lied to them, but then we learned actually the FBI was working with Michael Sussman and his law firm, Perkins Coie. Perkins Coie had an FBI workspace in its offices in Washington for a decade and Michael Sussman was so close to the FBI, he had a key card to FBI headquarters.  

We know this from a recently released text exchange. We're quoting. ""Do you have a badge or do you need help getting into the building?"" the FBI's general counsel, James Baker asked Sussmann. 

We're quoting now, ""I have a badge,"" Sussmann replied. Sussmann had a badge to the FBI building? How do we get one of those? Oh, we're not leading Democratic lawyers, so we can't have them. Michael Sussmann knew he'd never be punished. Take three steps back. What's going on here? In a fantastic piece at The Federalist, Ben Weingarten explained how we should understand these two prosecutions, ""They send an unmistakable message: We can get you any time, anywhere, on any grounds we choose. You can't touch even a single one of ours."" 

That's it right there. This is a partisan play by a political party that has somehow completely taken over our largest law enforcement agency and ... Michael Sussman is not even the biggest example of this. Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok —all of them lied to the feds as well. That's a crime. None of them were ever hauled off in leg irons. In fact, they're now at CNN, MSNBC and Georgetown, respectively. They were rewarded with better jobs for what they did... they always are.

Jim Clapper and John Brennan committed perjury on television before Congress. There's no dispute about that. What do they do? Oh, they're on TV now, too. Hunter Biden lied on a federal gun form. That's a felony. How was he punished? Oh, a mild probing on CBS that he just shrugged off as if it were nothing. Watch.  

  

""I don't know why the Secret Service are involved."" Really? You had no idea because they were with you. They helped you. You committed a gun felony. It's all out there, but Hunter Biden is the president's son and more importantly, he's a faithful party loyalist. So, you know as well as he does, he doesn't have a thing to worry about. In fact, he can flaunt his crimes. RadarOnline.com just got pictures of Hunter Biden casually waving his illegal firearm around as he cavorted with a prostitute several years ago.  

The pictures show Hunter Biden's finger on the trigger of the gun, as well as crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Hmm, a weapon of war in the hands of a drug addict. Is the Justice Department bothered by this? No, of course not.

You know what bothers the Justice Department quite a bit? Defying the Democratic Party. Do that and your house gets raided by a SWAT team that tips off CNN before it happens. Roger Stone discovered that the hard way.  

So that's the actual norm. If you were Tony Podesta and you work for the Democratic Party, you're totally fine. Nothing you do is going to get you in trouble, and you know it. If you're Roger Stone, you've done nothing wrong at all, but you've given the finger to the Democratic Party, they show up at your house with guns. That's the norm the attorney general is upholding. Serve the Democratic Party, and you'll be rewarded even if you're a felon.

At almost exactly the moment the DOJ was putting Peter Navarro in shackles, the DOJ was also dropping the most serious charges against the two left-wing lawyers who tried to incinerate cops, burn them to death in their patrol cars during the BLM riots.  

Now, this pair had faced 30 years in jail on terrorism charges, but that was too tough for the Biden DOJ. They'll be out in a couple, max. Why? Because they've got the right politics. And Liz Cheney is not giving you a lecture about. People who try to burn police officers to death are a threat to our democracy. No, they're fine. We're just going to ignore them. It never happened. This happens all the time.  

In California, at the height of the BLM riots, a career felon called Tony Walker executed a 19-year-old Berkeley student called Seth Smith, walked up for no reason, never seen him before in his life and executed him, fired a gun into the back of his head. Why did he do this? Because of his skin color. It was a racially motivated attack. ""F that White MF-er,"" Walker said. No one denies that. He said that, but here's the interesting thing, a guy is just executed on the street because he's got the wrong skin color.  

Sounds like a hate crime, right? No. Merrick Garland's DOJ did not pursue hate crime charges. In fact, a month ago, prosecutors called an unbelievable deal with Walker. They sentenced him on a single charge of (brace yourself) voluntary manslaughter. 

""F that White MF-er,"" he said as he executed a college student. It sounds like voluntary manslaughter.

 This is a dangerous trend and not just because people are dying. Nothing destroys the legitimacy of our institutions more than politicized law enforcement. You can't have that. Justice must be blind. If there is a single institution we have to preserve for the sake of our children and grandchildren, it's our justice system and the law enforcement agencies that serve it. They can't be corrupt. If they're corrupt, it's going to be pretty hard to live here.  

Liz Cheney and Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the lunatics on the January 6 committee have done far more damage to this democracy than the rioters ever did, far more. And now they're trying to make it worse. Axios is reporting that some members of the committee ""want big changes on voting rights and even to abolish the Electoral College."" 

Abolishing the Electoral College? And if you're against that, of course, you're undermining democracy.  

  

Oh, it's really chilling? What's really chilling is when the committee gets to arrest people, not because they violated meaningful laws or pose a threat to the United States, but because their politics are unacceptable, because they have given the finger to people like Liz Cheney. Is Liz Cheney okay with that? The upholder of democracy? 

We texted Liz Cheney on Friday and said, ""Are you okay? They just arrested a 72-year-old man who did nothing wrong. Doesn't that cross some kind of line? Are you going to stand up and say something about it?"" She didn't respond.

The January 6 committee has just hired a former producer of Good Morning America called James Goldston. He'll be overseeing the committee's primetime hearings on Thursday night. So, the show trial now has a production and of course, we'll be covering that in great detail on Thursday. By arresting , they're hoping to shut up one of the most vocal critics before it begins.

673	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-janet-yellen-policies-inflation	2022-06-07 22:25:00	Tucker Carlson: Janet Yellen's reckless, loose money policies caused inflation | Fox News	"Fox News host shreds Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as Americans experience record-high inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It was six years ago and one of those semi-hilarious moments that has unfortunately been lost to history that Janet Yellen sat through what must have been the single most uncomfortable congressional hearing of her life. At the time, you may remember, Yellen was running the Federal Reserve and she was, as she remains today, a lifestyle liberal in good standing.  

So, put yourself in her position and imagine the shock she must have felt when members of the Congressional Black Caucus suggested that she, Janet Yellen, was, in fact, a racist, maybe even a White supremacist. What did Janet Yellen do wrong? Well, they suggested what she did wrong was she failed to harness the power of the Federal Reserve to help African-Americans specifically. Now, at first, Yellen seemed confused by this complaint. The point of the Fed is to keep the American economy stable. The point is not to pay off loyal blocks of Democratic voters, and she tried to explain this.  

""Our powers,"" she said, ""can't be targeted at the experience of particular groups."" That was her response, but the Congressional Black Caucus did not buy it. Their message to Janet Yellen was the same as their message to you and every other person in this country with 350 million people: ""Do what we say, or we will denounce you as a racist."" And finally, Janet Yellen got that message. Boy, did she.  

Within a year, Yellen had all but abandoned the traditional constraints of monetary policy. Instead, there she was yammering on in public about things like racial equity and environmental justice. Now, those are issues that, unlike economics, cannot be quantified or even specifically defined. They are therefore perfect vehicles for power-hungry politicians hoping to become more powerful. 

Now, Yellen was supposedly an economist. But as she turned 70, she left the field of economics completely and entered the far more familiar world of political activism. By the time she became Joe Biden's Treasury Secretary, the transformation was complete. Among Yellen's first acts as Treasury secretary was an order changing the mission of the Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council. 

Now, that council was created by Congress after the last financial crisis, as its name suggests, to prevent something similar from ever happening again. And for about a decade, it focused on questions that might prevent another meltdown, questions like subprime lending and automated trading on Wall Street, relevant questions, but under Janet Yellen, the council turned its attention to a far more fashionable issue that she was consumed with: global warming.  

""We must look ahead at emerging risks,"" Yellen proclaimed, ""Climate change is obviously the big one."" She sent a letter to the World Bank telling them the same thing. As for inflation, which traditionally was a core concern of government economists, that was the emerging risk they were worried about, Yellen Just shrug that off. Inflation? If that happens, she told us in a now-famous quote, it'll be ""transitory."" 

In the history of bad predictions from Washington, which could fill volumes, that might take first place.  

In fact, since Joe Biden became president, the , and so have the prices of many other key commodities that Americans need to live and the worst part is that not only did Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, fail to see any of this coming. Janet Yellen, more than any other single person in America, caused it in the first place through reckless, loose money policies implemented during her years at the Fed, policies that were bound to cause inflation and did.  

So, if you're mad about the current state of the economy, Janet Yellen is probably the first person you should blame. Why does she still have her job? It's a good question. And we might have had an answer to that because Yellen was back in front of Congress today, but this time there were no tough interrogatories from the Congressional Black Caucus. No one called her a racist. Instead, they kissed up to her. 

As Yellen explained to a deeply sympathetic room of members of Congress, the real problem with the American economy is that she and the Democratic Party don't yet have enough control over it. Watch.  

So just for fun, if you have 5 minutes, rewind the tape, transcribe what she just said, and see if you can make sense of the verbal bouillabaisse. What are you looking at? It's called intersectionalism. It's the new religion of government, and it allows bureaucrats when it becomes clear they have no idea what they're doing to just pivot and talk about something they know even less about. So. here you have Janet Yellen talking about geopolitical influences, clean energy credits, climate change.

What is  talking about? Well, she has no idea. The problem is that there are people out there who actually do understand what she's trying to talk about. Experts, actual experts, have studied the sustainability of renewable energy for years.  

Michael Shellenberger, for example, found that from 2011 to 2017, the cost of solar panels dropped by more than 70% in this country. There are more of them. It's a supply and demand question. But here's the interesting part. During that same period as the cost of solar panels fell, electricity prices in California went up five times more than they did in the rest of the United States. Why more solar panels? The solar panels were cheaper, but the electricity they produced was more expensive. Huh? How does that work and how is it helping you?  

We know it happens because it happened in Germany at scale from 2006 to 2018. That would be the heyday, the peak years of Germany's big renewable energy push. Electricity prices went up 50%. Now, why did that happen? Well, let's compare it to a neighboring country. In France, electricity prices were much lower than Germany's even though France gets twice as much of its energy from clean energy sources as Germany does.

What? What made France so special? How'd they pull that off? Simple. Nuclear. 

France gets a lot of its energy from nuclear power. Janet Yellen does not consider nuclear power a renewable. When she says renewable, she means wind and solar, which by definition are not reliable sources of energy, but they are and this is always the key, highly profitable to Democratic donors and the government of China.  

So, of course, Janet Yellen is for them. Of course, Yellen didn't go into details on why she thinks what she does, because if you unpack it, if you slow down and speak clearly, it doesn't make any sense and Janet Yellen knows that. She's an activist. She gets that logic is irrelevant. Thinking clearly? No, that gets you nowhere. Emotion is what carries the day, and that's why during today's congressional hearings, she started talking about yet another topic she knows nothing about – gun crime.  

""Well, I'm horrified about gun violence."" I'm sorry, ma'am, you're the Treasury secretary. Shh, let's talk about the economy, which is imploding. Stop with your little abortion talk, your little gun talk. Not your area. Let's get back into your lane. You're the  secretary, but of course, she doesn't want to.  

The goal always is to talk about anything other than the economy. Why? Because they destroyed the economy, but there was one exception. At one point, Janet Yellen was asked because it's a pretty obvious question, how exactly as the Treasury secretary and former Fed chair, as an economist and a genius, how do you miss the inflation you caused? Hear when. 

Oh, so you didn't see  even though it was here for two years and we shut down the entire economy and then made up for the gap in productivity with profligate government spending where we just printed trillions of fake dollars, but you didn't think that was going to cause inflation somehow? And you didn't think a war in the breadbasket of Europe would affect food prices? 

Let's say you were a talk show host on a cable channel with no economic experience whatsoever or even the ability to balance a checkbook and it was obvious to you, but, you're the Treasury secretary, but you didn't see it coming? Maybe you shouldn't call it transitory? And your answer is, and we're quoting, ""I do expect inflation to remain high, although I do very much hope it will be coming down."" Oh, you very much hope? Is that where we are? We are very much hoping? Tell us more about abortion and gun violence if you would. Blame COVID and Putin and call it a day. It is a joke.  

Fox's Hillary Vaughn, to her credit, was not convinced. She asked Janet Yellen whether Joe Biden's decision to spend trillions of dollars might have contributed to inflation because like when you have more of something, it's worth less, like your currency, which is almost worth less and here was Janet Yellen's response.  

Go away, peasant, troll, your inflation talk. I'm worried about climate change and gun violence and abortion. Leave me alone, it's not like the Treasury secretary. Be gone. 

She should be gone. This is crazy. And in a functioning country, Janet Yellen would be in a retirement home somewhere writing her memoirs that no one would ever read, but that's not what's happening. She's still the Treasury secretary, and that's not what happened today. Instead, Democrats took turns bragging about their expensive electric cars. Worried about gas prices? Just get a Tesla, baby. Here's Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.  

Yes, because electric cars don't actually use energy, so they're disconnected from the international market. Hey Debbie Stabenow, what's an international market? You have any idea whatsoever? Do you know anything? 

You're telling us that the oil companies are so greedy they somehow canceled their own leases for drilling. They're so greedy. They don't even want to drill oil and that's why they shut down their own pipelines. Is that right? And that's why they're talking about implementing a gas tax, because they don't want you to use oil. Right?  

What's the reasoning here, Debbie Stabenow? Maybe we should contact Janet Yellen. Maybe she'll answer. Maybe she'll wave us away like the peasants we are. 

What's going on here? How can this person be our Treasury secretary? We're in deep waters. Is there anyone who can pull us out of them?

674	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-joe-biden-himself-questioning-fairness-elections	2022-06-08 22:09:00	Tucker Carlson: Joe Biden himself has begun questioning the fairness of elections | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on January 6 Capitol riots and discusses restoring Americans' confidence in the U.S. election system on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

A year and a half after January 6, the date much of the news right now, it's interesting that even the most basic questions about what actually happened that day remain mysteriously unanswered. First and most obviously, if you've seen the tape, why did law enforcement open the doors of the building and let protesters walk right into the Capitol? That's bizarre behavior, no matter what they say.  

So why did it happen and then once it did happen, why did authorities lie to the country for months and tell us that Officer Brian Sicknick had been murdered by the mob when in fact the medical examiner determined that he died of a stroke hours later? Just tonight on CBS News, we were informed, just a moment ago, as Norah O'Donnell stared on like it was true, that five police officers were murdered by the mob on January 6. Really?  

We know of one killing on January 6 and that killing was committed by Officer Michael Byrd, a Capitol Hill police officer with a confirmed record of highly reckless behavior with firearms, and yet, for some reason, he was allowed to shoot an unarmed, non-threatening woman in the neck. Why was he allowed to do that? What was the justification? No one's ever told us. Why is that? And by the way, just how many FBI agents and DOJ informants were active in the crowd on January 6, and what exactly were they doing there?  

Why can't we know the answer to that question? Seriously? Why did Kamala Harris lie about where she was on January 6 and why there's still no leads on those two attempted pipe bombings on Capitol Hill? Remember those? There are massive amounts of physical evidence, but the FBI apparently got nowhere. How come? And so on.  

So, there is still, once again, a remarkable amount that we don't know about what happened that day, despite the fact they tell us it was the largest FBI investigation in American history. That's very strange. We'll address it all in some detail on tomorrow's show, but tonight, we want to get to the most basic question of all you never hear asked and it's this: Why did so many Trump voters show up at the Capitol in the first place? Somehow no one's ever really explained that.  

For a year and a half, Democrats have searched for a smoking gun that would prove some sort of pre-planned conspiracy to . They haven't found that because there wasn't a preplanned conspiracy. So instead they've told us that the crowd converged on the Capitol that day because their orange cult leader commanded them to. Now, Trump did encourage a protest that day. That is true. But it's not a real explanation for what happened next. 

The people you saw  were not brainwashed robots mindlessly following their leader. Whatever you think of them, they weren't sociology students from Wesleyan telling you the straight face there are 400 genders because their professors told them so. No, they're just the opposite. These were mostly sober, middle-class people, older for the most part, small business owners from smallish towns, far from the fashionable coasts. They were mostly passionately patriotic Americans, the kind who believe in the Bill of Rights and know what it says.  

These are people who genuinely love America far more than, say, Chuck Schumer loves America. So why were they there? Why did they go to the Capitol? Well, because, again, unlike Chuck Schumer, they actually believed in democracy, and they believed their democracy had been taken from them. They were convinced that the presidential election was unfair, which it certainly was. Some of them believed the election had been rigged. We will let others debate whether that's true, but the fact is many that day believed it was true, and that itself is a huge problem for all of us going forward.  

The fact that large numbers of Americans believe democracy isn't real may itself be the biggest threat to our democracy because in order for our system to work, the population has to believe that it works. In other words, that our elections are fair and transparent and therefore legitimate. 

You can't just censor or arrest people for thinking the system is rigged. You have to show them the system isn't rigged. That is your baseline obligation if you lead the country and yet the Biden administration, amazingly, is doing just the opposite. After screaming at the rest of us for questioning elections (""That's immoral,"" they said), Joe Biden himself has begun to do just that. Here's Biden in January.  

Huh? So, 2020 was the most secure election in American history. They tell us that endlessly, and you're a nut, probably a criminal, if you say otherwise and they say that because Biden won. He got – what do they say – 81 million votes. But things are different now because the Democratic Party understands it will be severely punished. It will be spanked at the polls five months from now. So, because they know what the outcome is going to be, Joe Biden is now telling us that that election could ""easily be illegitimate."" 

Illegitimate? How would it be illegitimate? Well, if states required voter IDs at the polls to , that would be racism. It would be the new Jim Crow. Remember that? Then when primary elections in Georgia, the state most debated actually took place, those supposedly racist voting laws led to what? A 200% increase in early voter turnout.

Well, how'd that happen? Well, no one in the Democratic Party explained or even acknowledged that it did happen. Instead, they got back to work thinking of new ways to destroy the public's confidence in this upcoming election, the one they're almost certain to lose.

In the state of Michigan, a political activist called Jocelyn Benson, now the secretary of state, a former employee of the Southern Poverty Law Center by the way, just accused other secretaries of state of trying to rig the election by spreading ""disinformation."" Watch. 

Okay. So, first of all, people who don't blink enough ought to make you nervous. People who recite pre-masticated chunks of language handed to them by the DNC ought to be dismissed because they're not thinking for themselves. They're repeating propaganda. But secretaries of state should do that, should be feared because secretaries of state are responsible for certifying elections. So, if you were a secretary of state who wanted to restore the public's trust in election results, you'd probably do your best not to sound like a low IQ MSNBC weekend host on MSNBC. Instead, you would try to come off as competent and sane.

But Jocelyn Benson is deliberately doing the opposite. Why is she doing that? Why is she trying to shake your faith in the coming elections? You've got to wonder and of course, Jocelyn Benson's concerns about election integrity are strangely selective or maybe not so strange. 

She never mentioned, for example, a major and supposedly unintentional screw-up by the Census Bureau that just took place you probably haven't read about. The census just acknowledged they dramatically miscounted the population of 14 states and you may not be surprised to learn that most of the overcounted states were controlled by Democrats while the undercounted states were heavily Republican.  

Why does this matter? Because the census determines congressional apportionment. So, the mistakes the census just made could give Democrats control of the Congress. Therefore, Democrats aren't bothered by it. That's not a crisis. Democrats also aren't very interested in making sure that votes are counted quickly. Counting votes quickly, like delivering justice quickly and certainly, may be the single fastest way and most important way to restore the public's faith in the institution, in this case, in elections. 

 and it took weeks to get the answer. France just held a national election and announced the winner within a few hours using paper ballots, again the same day, and in Pennsylvania, a primary took weeks to decide. So, what's the difference? Well, in France, there's virtually no voting by mail. There's no early or absentee voting either. Ballots are hand-counted.

Our system is obviously much slower and critically, far more susceptible to voter fraud. Why? Because Democrats like it that way. They want you to distrust this fall's election results and that's why they're going on television to warn you that White supremacists, a term they never define because its power lies in its ambiguity, but somehow White supremacists are going to hunt down election officials and ""attack the election."" Watch this. 

White supremacists and the terrorists — terms they never define. The most powerful words in the English language, by the way, words they used to suppress the vote and terrify you, but Steve Cohen is telling you it's the White supremacist you have to worry about and by that, he means anyone who disagrees with him in any way.  

What you don't have to worry about is BLM, the Democratic militia who torched courthouses or shot people in the street, or the people who show up at the homes of Supreme Court justices with guns. None of that is a threat to democracy because all of that in the end helps the Democratic Party. 

Very few people say any of this out loud. One of the very few who's been brave enough to do that is, of all things, an NFL defensive coordinator called Jack Del Rio. He was attacked relentlessly for pointing this out. Here's what he said in response.  

Yeah, exactly. But ultimately, what matters long term for all of us is that people believe our system is real, that democracy is not a charade, the outcome is not predetermined, that everything in this country is not controlled by a small group of people, billionaires, and the people who work for them in Washington, that everybody has a voice, that we're all equal and that all citizens have an equal chance to choose their leaders. 

That's the core promise of democracy, and people no longer believe it. So, the question is: Can we now, with the current rules in place, have faith in November's elections? That really matters, not just because the outcome in November matters, but because the system itself matters more than anything.

675	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-truth-happened-jan-6-unknown	2022-06-09 22:09:00	Tucker Carlson: The truth of what happened on Jan. 6 is still unknown | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the Capitol riots and the January 6 committee's primetime hearing on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You know it tells you a lot about the priorities of a ruling class that the rest of us are getting yet another lecture about January 6th tonight from our moral inferiors, no less. An outbreak of mob violence, a forgettably minor outbreak by recent standards, that took place more than a year and a half ago, but they've never stopped talking about it.  

In the meantime, in the 18 months since , gas prices have doubled. Drug ODs have reached their highest point ever. The U.S. economy is now careening toward a devastating recession at best and scariest and least noted of all, this country has never in its history been closer to a nuclear war.

Yet the other networks can't be bothered to cover any of that tonight. Instead, they've interrupted their regularly scheduled programing to bring you yet another extended primetime harangue from Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney about Donald Trump and QAnon. The whole thing is insulting.  

In fact, it's deranged and we're not playing along. This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live. They are lying, and we are not going to help them do it. What we will do instead is to try to tell you the truth. We've attempted to do that since the day this happened. 

We hated seeing vandalism at the U.S. Capitol a year and a half ago, and we said so at the time, but we did not think it was an insurrection because it was not an insurrection. It was not even close to an insurrection. Not a single person in the crowd that day was found to be carrying a firearm – some insurrection. In fact, the only person who wound up shot to death was a protester.  

She was a 36-year-old military veteran called Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was just over 5 feet tall. She was unarmed. She posed no conceivable threat to anyone, but Capitol Hill Police shot her in the neck and never explained why that was justified. Those are the facts of January 6, but since the very first hours, they have been distorted beyond recognition, relentlessly culminating with last night.  

Last night, CBS Nightly News told its viewers that insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6 ""caused the deaths of five police officers."" That is a pure lie. There is nothing true about it, and they know that perfectly well. Here's reporter Bob Costa, who should be deeply ashamed to say something this dishonest.  

It's hard to believe he said that. Rioters cause the deaths of five police officers. You just heard CBS News tell its viewers that. This must be the big lie theory. The more bewilderingly false a claim is, the more likely you will be to believe it. Apparently, that's what they're betting on. In fact, precisely zero police officers were killed by rioters on January 6, not five, none. Not a single one. So, how'd they get to five? Well, CBS is counting the suicides of local police officers that took place after January 6, in some cases, long after January 6.  

Suicide, unfortunately, is pretty common among cops. Policing is a tough job, as we've noted. But in these specific cases, the ones CBS is referring to, the chief of Washington DC's police department told The New York Times that actually he had no idea if his officers were driven to kill themselves by January 6. CBS just made that up. 

The fifth death that CBS News is referring to is of Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick. You will remember his name. Sicknick's body lay in state at the Capitol after the media told us he'd been beaten to death by Trump voters with a fire extinguisher. Here's what they told you.  

Once again, that's not true. Everything you just heard was completely fabricated. The D.C. medical examiner performed an autopsy and the autopsy report showed that Officer Brian Sicknick had not suffered any kind of blunt force trauma. He was not beaten to death. He died of a stroke in his office later. No one has been charged in Officer Sicknick's death because Officer Sicknick wasn't murdered.  

They are lying to you. That is provable. Not a single person you just saw has apologized for lying. Not a single one. And it's not just the news media. Here's Congressman Pete Aguilar of California claiming that officers lost their lives on January 6.  

Let's rally around the truth, he says, as he lies to you. May those words burn your tongue, liar. But what did happen exactly on January 6? What's the truth of that day? Well, that's still unknown. From the extensive video we have of January 6, it's clear that some in the crowd, more than a few, were encouraging protesters to breach the Capitol, to commit felonies. We're not guessing at that, we've showed you the tape.  

We have pictures of their faces. In the case of a man called Ray Epps, we know his name, but they've never been charged. Ray Epps was standing in exactly the same place that a lot of people who went to jail were standing, but he wasn't charged. His name was taken off the FBI's Most Wanted list. Why is that? It doesn't make any sense at all. 

The January 6 committee will not explain that after a year, millions of dollars and a thousand interviews. They won't tell us, nor will they tell us how many FBI agents and assets were in the crowd that day and what were they doing there. Why can't we know that? And why are they still hiding thousands of hours of surveillance footage from within the Capitol? If the point of the committee was to get the truth out there, why can't we see the tape?  

Why did authorities open the doors of the Capitol to rioters and let them walk in, usher them in the doors? That's utterly bizarre. You saw that live. No one's ever explained it. What's the explanation for that? And by the way, whatever happened to the mysterious pipe bomber whose bombs we later learned many months later, Kamala Harris' bodyguards discovered. Kamala Harris told us she was at the Capitol that day, but she wasn't. She was at the DNC with a pipe bomb outside. Her bodyguards found that bomb, but she lied about that. She hid that. Why?  

That's got to be one of the weirdest stories ever. What does it mean, Liz Cheney? Silence. And of course, above all, they lied about the reason that January 6 happened in the first place and you know what it is. The entire country watched Joe Biden get what they claim was 10 million more votes than Barack Obama himself got. Joe Biden got 10 million more votes than Barack Obama got, and a lot of those votes arrived after the election.  

In a lot of places, voting was stopped in the middle of the night. Why? In the biggest states in the country, voter ID was optional. Why is that okay? A lot of the protesters on January 6 were very upset about that and they should have been. All of us should be, but the January 6 Committee ignored all of that completely. Instead, on the basis of zero evidence, no evidence whatsoever, they blamed the entire riot on White supremacy. Here's Joe Biden.  

What? There's no evidence for that – none. The people at the Capitol, including the ones who broke the law by entering the Capitol, which is a crime, those people to a person said they were upset because they believed their democracy had been stolen from them and whether all of their claims are true or not, that's a valid reason to be upset. But rather than reassure the rest of us that actually our democracy is sound, elections are fair and transparent, there's no cheating and we can prove it, rather than do that, they call half the country names and not just names, the worst thing you can be called, a White supremacist. And then, most bewilderingly of all, virtually no Republican in Washington pushed back against any of that.  

In fact, Lindsey Graham, violence worshiper to the end, said that his only regret was that the Capitol Police didn't shoot more Trump voters in the neck and kill them. ""You've got guns, use them,"" Graham said. So here you have a sitting U.S. senator, a Republican, urging police officers to shoot unarmed Americans, many of whom were ushered into the Capitol building by law enforcement.  

How can people talk like that? For more than a year, they justified rhetoric like Lindsey Graham ""shoot more"" by claiming that January 6 was an insurrection. That's not a word they were used to describe, say, the monthslong siege of a courthouse in Portland, or the ongoing coordinated effort to intimidate Supreme Court justices at their homes with guns, a story they ignored today. But January 6 was different, they reminded us. It was unique because it was their offices and because it bothered Nancy Pelosi.  

We are not defending and would never defend vandalism, violence, rioting. We disapproved of it when it happened. We disapprove of it now, all riots, not just this one. But this was not an insurrection. 

But, you know what will get you to insurrection? If you ignore the legitimate concerns of a population, if you brush them aside as if they don't matter when gas goes to $5 and you say ""buy an electric car."" When cities become so filthy and so dangerous that you can't live there, when the economy becomes so distorted that your own children have no hope of getting married and giving you grandchildren, when you don't care at all about any of that and all you do is talk about yourself, nonstop – you might get an insurrection if you behave like that, speaking of insurrection.

Thank heaven it's Friday, mostly because it's not Thursday. Yesterday was Thursday, a day that will live in shame in the history of the American news business.  

Yesterday, last night, every news network in this country, but this one faithfully surrendered its entire primetime lineup to Nancy Pelosi. So, in place of news coverage, people who tuned in got two straight hours of unedited campaign propaganda scripted by the Democratic Party. The effect was North Korean — every channel the same. Nothing like it has ever happened in this country. Now, the news anchors who faithfully did Pelosi's bidding, pretended they were hearing some sort of congressional hearing, but they were lying. It was not a hearing. At a hearing, dissent is permitted. The other side can speak. Evidence is presented. Evidence is not censored or deceptively edited. That's not allowed.  

So, what we saw last night was definitely not a hearing. It was a show trial. There was no pretense of fairness or accuracy. The whole thing was indecent. How many people were convinced by what they saw last night? Hmm, right around zero. They're not going to win a single vote, so why did they do it? There had to be a reason. They're not that stupid.  

Well, the reason they did it is every minute news anchors are whining about some imaginary threat from QAnon (Remember QAnon?) every minute they're doing that, they're not covering the collapse of the American economy, something everyone actually cares about. ""Collapse"" is a strong word, but how would you describe it today? Inflation hit 8.6%. Those are the official numbers. Those are the numbers arrived at using the government's own cooked metrics, but it's still the  in more than 40 years, so it's not surprising that consumer confidence is at the lowest level ever recorded. Why? Really, it comes down to energy. 

The cost of energy is up nearly 40% over last year. The average price of a gallon of gas is now over five bucks, but it won't stop there. JPMorgan predicts it'll get to $6 and soon. So, when the price of fuel goes up, so does the price of everything else because our transportation systems are dependent on the price of fuel. And when it gets high enough, people can't go anywhere, even the police.  

In Michigan, one department says it can no longer respond to emergency calls because the price of gas is going too high. ""We've exhausted what funds were budgeted for fuel with several months to go before the budget reset,"" said the sheriff of Isabella County on Tuesday, ""I've instructed the deputies to attempt to manage whatever calls are acceptable over the phone.""

So, enforcing the law over the phone. It sounds like a story from the Third World, but that's America. It's Michigan and it's just the beginning.  

A CNBC survey just found that 68% of corporate CFOs are predicting a recession soon. Zero chief financial officers surveyed by CNBC believed a recession could be avoided. All of them thought it was absolutely inevitable. What are the effects? Well, one of them is staples, food prices. They were already up 5% in December. They're now up more than 10% year over year.

So, when food becomes too expensive to buy, you have a crisis. How is the administration responding to this crisis, a demonstrable crisis? Well, Biden has just unveiled new regulations on ethanol.  

By the way, here's a really simple test if you want to know you're speaking to someone who understands anything about science or the environment. Anyone who tells you ethanol is good for the ""environment"" is either ignorant or lying. We know after decades of studying it, that ethanol hurts the environment. There is no environmental benefit to ethanol, and there's a massive cost both to the land and also to you. 

Thanks to Biden, gasoline refiners will be forced to blend 20 billion gallons of ethanol because it's a renewable fuel for the planet. But what this really is, is a requirement from the Biden administration to burn food in your car. That's what ethanol is. It's corn. So, what happens when you divert food crops like corn to ethanol production? Well, we know the answer because it's been studied for decades.  

In 2008, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell called David Pimentel, wrote this: ""The use of corn for ethanol has led to major increases in the price of U.S. beef, chicken, pork, eggs, bread, cereal, milk. It's a boon to agribusiness and a pain to consumers."" In fact, ""the director general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reports that using 22 pounds of corn to produce one gallon of ethanol is already causing food shortages."" 

Well, of course. That was 2008. This is not news. Anyone who's been paying attention can tell you ethanol is bad for the environment. It's terrible for engines, and it is above all a disaster for your food supply. 

So, at the same moment we are facing food shortages, the Biden administration has decided to make food scarcer and more expensive. Food will be just as expensive as gasoline. And you probably hadn't heard about that because once again last night, every single news network in this country except ours was reporting on something else. Here are their priorities.  

  

These people. Now, normally you could just say, ""Well, they're dumb. That's why they're on TV in the first place, reading scripts that somebody else wrote."" I mean, it really is like ""Anchorman,"" if you want to be totally honest about it—hairhats, reading words they don't understand. That is true. That's actually what it is.

But in this case, it's more than ignorance. It's more than stupidity. It's complicity in a campaign to fool the public, to make you believe that your personal concerns like the fact you can't buy food or drive anywhere or the police won't come because they can't afford gas, those are not important.  

What's really important is some other thing that you should be terrified of, ""Russia. It's Putin. It's QAnon. It's the White supremacists. They're going to get you!"" And anyone who worries about gas prices, anyone who's concerned about how to feed his or her family gets a lecture that actually you're just selfish. ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated!"" Really, or whatever the talking point is. Here was CNN last night. Watch.  

A civics lesson from Don Lemon. Mr. Lemon, tell us about democracy. What is democracy? You just summed it up for us, if you would. It's a term you use a lot. What is democracy?

Well, democracy is the process by which government represents voters and their concerns. Voters vote in representatives. They go to Washington and they carry with them in their hearts the memory of the people who put them there and their concerns are first and foremost. So, what are the first and foremost concerns of American voters, the people at the heart of this democracy?  

Well, food and gas prices, but the people who are defending democracy, look at those people and say, ""Shut up, you selfish rube. You really should care about  because democracy."" The overwhelming majority of Americans don't care about January 6 and that's why they need to beat you in the face with it again and again and again.

They wouldn't be hysterical. They wouldn't be repetitive. They wouldn't be patronizing if you actually cared, but you don't, so they have to lecture you like a child. So, the midterms are approaching, this is the Biden administration strategy: Talk about something else. Shame you if you don't think it's the most important thing. So, Biden began talking today. This was a speech that was billed as an address on inflation, but it didn't begin with inflation or any honest account of how we got here and how we're going to get out of it. No, it was about January 6. Watch.  

The overstatement is so ridiculous. You look at everything that's going on in the world. We know what happened on January 6 because no event in human history has had more cameras trained on it. You can watch the video. You can spend the rest of your life watching the video on the Internet. Why don't you go ahead and do that and get back to us? Does that look like a dagger at the heart of democracy? Is that the darkest chapter in American history? It's like, insane that you would even talk like that. ""It's QAnon. Really! Trump is bad."" 

It's repulsive, actually, when you think about it. Russia is threatening to destroy New York City with nuclear weapons. So, how are we doing on that front? Well, it turns out, we're sourcing a critical component in our ammunition, not just small arms, but nuclear weapons from China. So, at the moment, we're actually closer to war than in any time in your lifetime, any time since 1945, since the big war ended, we're closer right now than at any time since then and what are we doing about this? What's the State Department doing to fix the crisis in Eastern Europe? Well, they have, they just announced this, they've hired a global equity ambassador. Oh, that'll fix it. Oh, more equity.  

This is nuts. It's like rearranging bookshelves by title as your house burns down. This is a species of mental illness. Everybody sees how fake this is. Nobody is convinced by it. It was just two years ago, live on television, summer of 2020, a mob of Biden voters tried to storm the White House. Do you remember this? They torched a church across the street.  

They attacked Secret Service officers. A mob called for the president of the United States to be lynched. He was taken to an underground bunker for his safety. We don't like to be hysterical, so we got to downplayed it at the time. Probably shouldn't have. Maybe we should have, as hysterical as Joe Biden, ""This is Pearl Harbor,"" but I have been lying, so we didn't. This is what our country's capital looked like at the time. 

You know, you really sort of hate to get into the war of, ""Well, you think that's bad? This was worse! Look at our tape,"" but really, it's just too much. Stop lying to us. Stop telling us things that we know for a fact are not true because we watch them in real time. You didn't hear anything about that last night, about similar riots that destroyed cities all over the United States.  

You didn't hear a single word. None of that was a dagger at the throat of our democracy. All that happened in an election year with the aim of influencing the election. Unmentioned, you heard not one word about the guy who just tried to assassinate a Supreme Court justice at his home at the urging of the Senate majority leader. Can't talk about any of this.

These topics, like the state of the U.S. economy, are now off limits. You have to pretend that January 6, 2021, remains the single worst thing ever to happen to America, even though not one living person really believes that and if you don't say so, if you don't confess the one true faith in public, you'll be hurt. It just happened to an NFL coach called Jack Del Rio. He just learned this lesson, a completely Soviet moment. We've got more on that in just a minute.

But first, take a few steps back. So, this is a perverse arrangement and you got to wonder who benefits. The Congress and the entirety of corporate media bury the actual problems facing the United States, pretend like they're not even happening. Why are they doing this and who is getting rich from it? Inflation doesn't happen by accident. It's the product of choices. The inflation we're now living through was created on purpose. The United States government got to a place where the debt was too big, and the only answer was to inflate it away.  

If you are a major debt holder, the only way out for you is to make the money less valuable, and so they did this on purpose. They want inflation to skyrocket, of course, and continue to rise. You're not going to hear any of that from the professional commentators on cable news, but you will hear it from people who still have common sense, like this guy at a gas station the other day. Watch this.  

Okay. So, inflation almost certainly is hurting you. In fact, a new analysis out today showed that the average family will pay this year a full month in its total income, just in inflation, a full month. Who's it good for? Well, if you've got massive corporate debt, it's a really good deal because you get to pay yesterday's accounts, yesterday's debts with today's inflated dollars. 

That money has lower real value, so you were getting a deal. It's a scam. They're doing this on purpose. But you could only pull that off if the people you were hurting were completely distracted, so let's scream at them some more about January 6. Then they might not notice. 

At this point, we don't really have a choice but to tolerate inflation. That's the truth. The traditional way to attack inflation is to raise interest rates. But inflation has gotten so high that it's going to be pretty tough to do that. U.S. debt to GDP now stands at nearly 125%. That means for every point we raise the interest rate, we're going to wind up paying even more in interest charges on that debt. If the Fed tries to raise interest rates any way to the point they might actually affect inflation. 

What will that do? Well, let's say you bumped it 11 points. I mean, which you probably have to do to get inflation under control. Jerome Powell, who runs the Fed, has already said there's no limit to how high interest rates could go.  

At least one financial expert has said 6% interest rates could be coming and maybe that's just a start, on top of the ones we've already seen. Now, what would that mean for you? Well, interest rates that high would crush Americans with credit card debt and that's most of the country.  

In fact, is the highest rate ever. It would make buying a house basically impossible. It would crash markets. It would crush asset prices. Are we going to do that? That's kind of our option. Probably not.

So . If you want to know why they're talking about January 6 in primetime, that's why.

677	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-red-flag-laws-mass-shootings-due-process	2022-06-13 22:34:00	Tucker Carlson: Red flag laws will not end mass shootings but will end due process | Fox News	"WARNING—Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to calls for red flag laws following the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Joe Biden's publicist just announced with a straight face that he plans to run again in 2024. We'll address that at some length tomorrow. But first, another crisis in the news. So, after the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde a few weeks ago, you begin to hear people on television talk about something called red flag laws. The government, they informed us, could actually end mass shootings tomorrow simply by taking the guns away from mass shooters before they commit mass shootings. It's not complicated.

In fact, it's such an obvious solution that you had to wonder why we weren't already doing that. Who doesn't want to prevent mass shootings? Well, only the gun lobby. Everybody else cares about children. So, a lot of Americans, not surprisingly, now say they want red flag laws, and why wouldn't they? Like supporting Black Lives Matter or fighting climate change or getting the COVID shot or standing with the brave people of Ukraine.  seem like one of those ideas that no decent person could possibly oppose.  

You want crazy people to have guns? Of course, you don't. Who would? So naturally, you're for red flag laws and in fact, we may soon get red flag walks across the country. So, what would that mean if we do? 

Well, two things you should know. First: Red flag laws will not end mass shootings, but red flag laws will end due process. Due process is a simple concept, but it's the key to everything that is good about America. 

In our system of justice, citizens cannot be punished without first being charged with a crime. Politicians cannot just decide to hurt you, throw you in handcuffs, lock you in jail, seize your property simply because they don't like how you think or how you vote. No. Before they punish you, they have to go through a formal process in which they describe which specific law you broke and exactly how you broke it. They have to prove it. 

For serious crimes with big penalties, the government has to convince a group of your fellow citizens first. It's called a grand jury and this government must convince them that you deserve to be punished or they cannot proceed. None of this is new. This is the way we've done things in America for more than 200 years, and it's exactly why we have and have always had the fairest justice system in the world. People move to this country from all over the globe to benefit from it. But red flag laws will end this.  

Under red flag laws, the government doesn't have to prove you did anything wrong in order to strip you of your most basic rights. All that's required to punish you is a complaint, possibly even an anonymous complaint in which somebody says you seem dangerous. Now, that complaint doesn't come from a grand jury. It can come from anyone, including someone who hates you or someone who simply doesn't like your politics. It doesn't matter because no jury will ever see it. On the basis of that unproven complaint, you lose your freedom and your ability to defend yourself and your family.  

Now, how could that possibly happen in this country? Well, the Supreme Court has said unequivocally that it can't happen here. A year ago, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Caniglia vs Strom. Police in Rhode Island had seized the personal firearms of a 68-year-old man whose wife had called in a complaint against him after they had an argument. That man had committed no crime. He'd never been convicted of a crime, and he was judged by doctors to be sane. And yet the authorities took away his guns anyway.  

He sued under the Fourth Amendment and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. The result was not even close. The Supreme Court sided with the gun owner in that case in a rare nine-zero decision. That means that every justice, liberal and conservative, agreed that authorities cannot just seize your property or throw you in jail because they don't like the way you look or because someone is mad at you. So, red flag laws are unconstitutional, period. We don't need to guess about that. And yet the Biden administration is pushing them anyway. Why? Because they don't care.  

How is Joe Biden able to ignore a Supreme Court decision from last year? Simple. He declares an emergency and does what he wants. He's done it before. The White House did the same thing with the eviction moratorium and vaccine mandates last year. ""It's an emergency. We don't have time for due process!""

So, you can see why Democrats love emergencies. Nothing gives them more power more quickly. They've declared the atrocities in Uvalde and Buffalo an emergency, unlike the  in Baltimore and Chicago, cities they run and whose killings they therefore assiduously ignore. And on the base of that emergency, they can move forward with gun confiscation.  

The White House now wants Congress to pass a law paying the states to enact red flag laws. And here's the amazing part: At least ten Republican senators are backing this effort from the Biden White House and that means this is virtually guaranteed to pass. What's the reasoning? Well, here's one of those senators, John Cornyn of Texas. 

You have colleagues on the other, in the other chamber who are already coming out against this before you even put out a proposal.  

So there are two things to notice about that soundbite, which is so revealing. The first is the use of the term ""sensible."" Now that is a Democratic talking point approved by the DNC. ""It's sensible gun safety regulation."" So here you have John Cornyn taking Nancy Pelosi's language and he's doing it on purpose and then you hear him describe anyone who disagrees with him. Why would you disagree with John Cornyn? Well, according to John Cornyn, anyone who disagrees with them is ""concerned about the politics"" of red flag laws, not the wisdom of red flag laws, not whether or not red flag laws are constitutional, but the grubby politics.  

In other words, says John Cornyn, anyone who disagrees with me is low and unethical.

Now, if you're not used to hearing liberal demagoguery like that from Republicans, you should know that John Cornyn is not the only one engaging in it. He is joined in this effort by Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of course of Utah, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, needless to say, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (always on board for any bad idea) and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. 

Particularly interesting to see Lindsey Graham on board, the person who encouraged Capitol Hill police to shoot more Trump voters, who has no problem with violence, whose life is organized around worshiping it, telling you that you can't have a gun. Now, all the senators whose names we just read, many of whom are retiring so they're beyond the reach of voters, have the backing of the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell. 

So, what exactly are they backing when they back red flag laws?  

Well, we can take Florida's experience as an example. In Florida, the police can seize guns from people who pose a ""significant danger"" based on ""any relevant evidence."" Huh? That's it, any relevant evidence. The law raises some obvious questions, and the most obvious is if you can seize people's guns without proving that they committed a crime, why can't you imprison them without proving they committed a crime? If you can take their guns, why can't you take their homes? Why can't you empty their bank accounts? Oh, sound paranoid? Alex Jones stuff? That just happened in Canada.  

What stops it from happening here? We already know the authorities are abusing the red flag laws already on the books. Kendra Parris is a lawyer based in Florida who specializes in them. In a recent interview, she said clients are able to hire lawyers, have ""vastly higher"" odds of getting their firearms back from the government. 

Of course, laws like this always penalize the weakest. She said courts are taking it ""better safe than sorry approach"" to avoid political blowback and the police are taking advantage of that. So, court records show that cops in Florida often show up to the homes of citizens who present them with ""stipulations."" If you agree in writing to surrender your firearms, you have a chance of getting them back after a year. Now, as it happens, that's a pretty tempting offer to offer when you have armed people in your living room. But it is and it remains and again, we don't need to guess about it because the Supreme Court just ruled on this, it's unconstitutional.  

It is for several reasons. It's a clear violation of the search and seizure prohibition on the Fourth Amendment, but it's also applied unfairly. And even the people who wrote our current red flag laws admit that. In New York, for example, Assembly member Jo Anne Simon co-sponsored the state's red flag law. ""Basically, it's all over the place,"" Simon admitted. ""You have places where we have one filed, in other places where it's 38 filed."" 

So, how will these laws be applied? Well, of course, they will be applied along political lines, just like everything else currently is in this highly politicized country. So, if you don't like someone, if you don't like what someone believes, that person will be a target for unconstitutional search and seizure. Armed authorities showing up in somebody's home and taking their personal property at gunpoint. And if you doubt that, that will happen, look at this. 

This is the guy, the very same member of Congress who had sex with a Chinese spy demanding that cops disarm Ben Shapiro because Ben Shapiro says things the Chinese government disagrees with. This is from Eric Swalwell: ""Please tell me this lunatic does not own a gun. Reason number 1,578 that America needs red flag laws."" Eric Swalwell wrote that. 

Now what would qualify as a trigger for gun seizure in the view of Eric Swalwell under the red flag was that he supports and now Republicans in the Senate support? Well, here's the video that Ben Shapiro made that Swalwell thinks qualifies him for red flag law. Watch. 

""These rights pre-exist government."" Well, actually our founding documents make that point which he is merely repeating, but on the basis of effectively quoting the founding documents of the country we live in, Eric Swalwell says the police should show up at Ben Shapiro's house and take his firearms away. Does anybody, even Eric Swalwell, who is deranged, sincerely believe that Ben Shapiro is a violent threat to anyone? No, of course not. Ben Shapiro is an ideological threat and an ideological threat is the only kind of threat people like Eric Swalwell actually care about and you know that when you look at the laws that they're pushing and that Republicans are backing. 

If these laws were actually designed to fight gun crime, they would, among other things, force prosecutors to enforce existing gun laws against people who are committing all the murders and it's not Ben Shapiro. In Los Angeles and many other cities, that's not happening and that's why those criminals openly support the Soros-backed prosecutor, George Gascon. Watch.  

Yeah. So that's just one tape. We can play you video, as we often do, of what's happening in our city. What you're looking at is anarchy, tyranny. People who are favored by the regime can do whatever they want. You vote the right way, commit whatever crimes you want, in jail for 10 minutes, you're out, go do it again, no problem. Baltimore can happen, mass killings on an ongoing basis for decades and no one will say a word. But if you're disfavored by the regime, no punishment is too strong, no infraction too small. 

None of the gun legislation that John Cornyn and all these other pompous buffoons who were siding with Nancy Pelosi support, none of that legislation would do anything about the core problem, which is DAs like George Gascon, who are failing to enforce existing gun laws, gun laws that, by the way, George Gascon himself, to name one example, is breaking. 

A whistleblower in Gascon's office says he was fired for complaining about Gascon's habit of illegally carrying firearms aboard airplanes. So, why haven't the cops red-flagged George Gascon and disarmed him? Is anyone going to red-flag , was a drug addict carrying a illegally obtained weapon? No, of course not, because red flag laws aren't designed to punish the politically loyal. And that's why you get scenes like this in New Orleans, which the police do nothing about. 

So hey, John Cornyn, will your legislation do anything about that? Because anybody who's okay with that or what's happening in downtown Chicago or downtown Baltimore or Gary, Indiana or Detroit, just pick a city, every day of the week – fix those things and get back to me about the AR in my closet. 

By the way in New Orleans, the Soros-backed DA there, Jason Williams isn't worried about what you just saw. Last year, his office dismissed more than 60% of violent felony cases that came to his office, most of them involving firearms. So, they just dismissed him. These are the people worried about gun crime. For perspective, the previous administration dismissed only 16% of those cases.  

Another Soros-backed DA in Philadelphia has a similar record. In the first half of last year, Larry Krasner's office withdrew or dismissed 65% of all gun charges. Does that seem high? Well, it is because in 2015, that figure was just 17%. New ideology, new outcome, and of course, the outcome is more dead people. But this law does nothing about that. It ignores it completely in favor of redefining you as a violent threat and giving the authorities controlled by the Biden administration the right to march into your house with guns drawn and disarm you. 

So, what are they ignoring? Well, let's see. Last year in Philadelphia, we set a record set for homicides. Already this year, more than 200 people have been shot to death in the city of Philadelphia, which is not a huge city, and it's getting smaller. On Friday, for example, a 14-year-old boy was killed in a drive-by. On Saturday, a man was shot five times in West Philadelphia. Did you see that on the news? Probably not.  

On Sunday night, a man taking care of his mother in North Philadelphia was shot in the back of the head. So, if you're actually worried about gun crimes, gun atrocities (and for the record we are because unlike Lindsay Graham. We actually hate violence) you would do something about this and punish the people who are committing gun crimes.

But no. They want to prevent you from defending your family, from buying or holding guns. Why is that? Well, we don't need to guess because they're telling us. Watch what the attorney general of the United States, and just to restate, this guy actually is the attorney general. He's more than a craven political hack. He runs the DOJ. Watch him describe, Mr. Merrick Garland, the biggest threat facing this country today.  

That's just a total lie, actually, and we have numbers to prove it, but, you know, it's a lie. There's no justification rationally for what Merrick Garland just said. It's ridiculous. It's an obvious untruth and anyone living in a major city knows that.

So, why do they keep telling you that?  

Well, because nothing the Biden administration is doing and nothing that is happening in Congress right now will actually address gun violence. That's not the point, John Cornyn. The point is to allow the Democratic Party to become even more powerful, and if it feels like it, to send its armed agents to raid the homes of Ben Shapiro and other disobedient people the Democratic Party doesn't like.

We do not want to deliver another depressing show, and we won't. But if you're looking at the country and thinking, ""How do we measure the health of the United States?"" there are pretty obvious ways to do it. The average life expectancy is one, the marriage rate, the effectiveness of the U.S. military, housing costs, the value of the U.S. dollar, health of the financial markets, the safety of our streets, etc. By every single one of those very basic measures, the Biden administration has failed and done so dramatically.  

, though obviously he is. Biden is the single most destructive force in the history of the United States. In just a year and a half, Biden and Ron Klain, his strange, shadowy chief of staff, have done more damage to this country than anybody could possibly have imagined. We read the numbers every night, but they don't capture it. You know, what captures it? This story.  

This story comes from the reliably liberal financial news outlet CNBC. Here's the second sentence of the piece: ""A rising number of former Californians are migrating out of the country altogether and are instead heading south of the border. Many are seeking a more relaxed and affordable lifestyle in Mexico.""

Yes, in Mexico, not Switzerland. Mexico. So, things are so bad in  that thousands of Americans are voluntarily moving to a Third World country in the middle of a brutal drug war. Yes, there are human heads littering the side of the road in Acapulco, but at least it's not Los Angeles.  

Darrell Graham works in real estate in Mexico. He says of the people he sells to ""at least half are coming down from California... Suddenly the cost of taxes, the crime rates, the politics, all the things that people are unhappy with in California make them want to come down to Mexico."" Another analyst who studies the trend at the Migration Policy Institute says so many Americans are relocating to Mexico right now that locals are being priced out of their own neighborhoods. 

So, it's mass migration in reverse. It's pretty amazing.  

No matter how bad you thought this administration was going to be, you probably could not have imagined ever caravans of Biden refugees fleeing our country across the southern border, looking for a better life in Mexico. At this rate, the next stop will be Port au Prince. Say what you will about Haiti, it's better than Baltimore. Now, one upside of moving to Latin America is like-minded neighbors. Hispanics despise Joe Biden, too. Biden's approval rating among Hispanic voters in this country has fallen to 24%. That's his lowest among any demographic group.  

Meanwhile, as of tonight, guess who's the preferred candidate for 2024 among self-described Latinos? That's right. The Taco Bowl Guy, Donald J. Trump. Let that sink in for a second. Donald Trump, supposedly the most anti-Hispanic racist this country has ever produced, that man, is far more popular among actual Hispanics than a cringing White liberal like Joe Biden. So, the guy who tried to build a border wall is loved. The guy who uses the word Latinx, not ironically, is hated. Remarkable.  

It's also—and this is not an overstatement—politically, a disaster of generational magnitude for the Democratic Party. Latinos dislike Joe Biden intensely, and they dislike him for the same reason that everybody else does. Biden has made things worse, a lot worse. The median income in this country is $44,000 a year – a year. Imagine trying to live on that right now. Do the math. You couldn't do it. Not in any recognizably American way. . It's making you poorer. Well, today in Philadelphia, Joe Biden unveiled his plan to fix inflation. Now watch this tape and keep in mind as you do that, it is real. We've not edited it in any way. Here it is:

This guy. The AFL-CIO. How many private sector labor union members support Joe Biden? 12%? 15%? It's not 50% And yet they host the guy. They're so corrupt.

But listen to the message. Higher taxes will make the things that you buy cheaper. That's what Biden just said. Inflation is up because taxes aren't high enough. Now, it's hardly a defense of corporate America, which we would never defend, to point out that as an economic analysis is completely insane. It's not true. 

We've lost control of inflation because people like Joe Biden pushed a species of lunacy called modern monetary theory. They printed an endless torrent of fake money to enrich and empower themselves and by doing that, they crashed the U.S. dollar and made you much poorer. That's what happened. There's not much debate about that and they're not going to acknowledge it, of course. They can't even be bothered to pretend to care about baby formula shortages. Here's Joe Biden's publicist just yesterday.  

Oh, mothers can't feed their babies. ""Let me see what I have here."" Somehow, the White House communications team forgot to load the baby formula talking points into the binder, leaving our historic LGBTQ+ immigrant, class ceiling shattering press secretary speechless. ""I just don't have them in front of me."" In other words, ""What does that question have to a trans rights? Nothing? Okay, next."" 

The one thing Karine Jean-Pierre can say with dead certainty is that Joe Biden is great. Joe Biden is energetic. He's fully in charge of his faculties. In fact, he's planning on running again in 2024, by which time all of suburban Chicago will have moved to Haiti in search of a higher standard of living.  

She actually said that, ""To be clear, as the president himself has said repeatedly, he plans to run in 2024."" And we can just guess how you feel about that, but how do leaders of the Democratic Party feel about that? He's their guy, and yet they're horrified. Even Sandy Cortez, who can defend anything if she has to up and including another pointless neo con war in Ukraine, even she can't get behind another Joe Biden run. Watch.  

""Yeah. We'll cross that bridge, right? We'll take a look at it."" So, what they're really saying and this is their latest talking point is, ""We don't like Joe Biden and we never have."" They've got nothing to do with Joe Biden, turns out. David Axelrod and Joe Scarborough, the other professional liars who foisted this senile mannequin on America, are now trying to run away from him.  

The New York Times, which is their newsletter, ran a front-page story two days ago on Sunday about Joe Biden's mental decline. Really? That topic was completely off limits just a year ago. You couldn't say it. The New York Times quoted one DNC official who's advising Biden to announce now, right after the midterms, that he's not running again. As David Axelrod masterminding the Obama victories, put it himself, ""The presidency is a monstrously taxing job and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue."" 

In other words, he's too freakin' old. Biden has got dementia. Who knew? Well, actually, they all knew, and they all knew all along, and they should not be allowed at this late date to evade their culpability for knowing and lying about it. They committed this crime. These people are cynical. They're ruthless. They're morally disfigured and if you need more proof of that, consider how they're treating poor Kamala Harris.  

They've abandoned Kamala Harris completely. It's shocking, really, given that just 18 months ago, these very same people were yelling at you about how lucky you were to have this historically Indian, Black female vice president, the very first in history. It was thrilling. They got emotional just thinking about it. Kamala Harris was that wonderful. Here's a recap.  

  

""Don't tell me things can't change!"" Oh, they can change and they have. That was just the other night. We were getting goose bumps listening to it, but now they're ghosting Kamala Harris like a bad tinder date. They're pretending she doesn't exist. In effect, in doing that, the Democratic Party is embracing White supremacy. How? Well, Democratic Party leaders plan to deny Harris a job that she has earned as Democratic nominee and replace her in the next cycle with yet another—wait for it now—White man.  

Let's try Beto. How about Mayor Pete? Notice a theme here? Pale and male as they are forever telling us because it turns out diversity isn't actually our strength. Equity and inclusion are fine if you're hiring middle managers at a big company. You would never hire a middle-aged White guy at Citibank. That's probably illegal, same with the airlines and hospitals. We've got way too many White male pilots and heart surgeons and Supreme Court justices. The Biden administration tells us that constantly. 

They seem to me that they use DOJ to enforce their rules. Yet somehow the most anti-White political party in the English-speaking world is suddenly pushing another White man for president. How does that work, Joe Biden and friends Ron Klain? 

Well, it turns out the presidency is a different thing. Affirmative action is essential for vice presidents, obviously. That's how we got Kamala Harris in the first place, but not for presidents. Presidents have too much power, so the usual diversity standards don't apply. We've had 46 White male presidents in a row, and the Democratic Party wants you to have another.  

Oh, not so fast, racists. Hold on a second. Now, the rest of official Washington may be completely on board with this coup against Kamala Harris, who, again earned the job. They may be willing to stand back and allow America's highest-ranking woman of color to be degraded and humiliated in the pages of The New York Times, but we're not. We believe Kamala Harris is a human being with hopes and dreams and aspirations.  

She's a first in so many ways. She celebrated Kwanzaa before it was even invented and of course, now that Oprah is retired, Kamala Harris is America's main source of life affirming aphorisms that don't actually mean anything. Watch this montage, which we have lovingly collected. Ask yourself how anyone who stand in the way of this woman becoming president United States.  

  

What do you know? She's unbelievable. You would deny that person a chance to serve? That is the person the Democratic insiders are tonight, ladies and gentlemen, trying to remove from the public stage and if no one else to say it, we will. It's wrong. Despite appearances, Kamala Harris is not a disposable consumer product. She's a pioneer. Do you what she went through trying to get a fair shake in the systemically racist country as the daughter of college professors? It wasn't easy. You know how hard she worked? At one point, she even dated Montel Williams. Few would go that far, but Kamala Harris did. No wonder she's sick and tired of being sick and tired. We get it. Watch as she did the work and unpacked her generational trauma live on television for you.  

""Yeah, that little girl was me."" Now, that little girl actually grew up in Frenchspeaking Canada, not in the Jim Crow South, but whatever. Look what she's become. Now, simply because she's a moron and no one likes or even agrees on how to pronounce her first name, the Democratic Party is trying to throw Harris away, toss her out the window like a used Big Mac wrapper. 

Now, Kamala Harris may be stained with secret sauce, but she deserves more than that. Yes, she does. Mediocrity is no excuse for firing someone. A low IQ, a terrible personality, a total inability to do the prescribed job –  those are not reasons to deny someone a job. The Biden administration has told us that repeatedly.  

By the way, democracy plays a role in this, too. You just saw the woman who Liz Cheney tells us a lot that 81 million votes in the last election. Now that's the most votes of any vice president in history. That's more votes than Liz Cheney's dad got. So, denying Kamala Harris the Democratic nomination in 2024 is nothing less than a form of insurrection.  

It's an attack on democracy and on our sacred norms. It's disinformation, probably Russian in origin. Whatever it is, we cannot allow it and as long as this show is on the air, we won't. Tonight, we are endorsing  Democratic primaries. She deserves it and so do Democrats. They created her. They should be forced to live with her and anyone who disagrees with that is, by definition, a racist.

Here's one rule we try to follow. You probably should distrust anybody who draws quick and dirty partisan conclusions in the hours after a national disaster. You see this happen all the time. People on TV, for example, telling you the  for the latest school shooting, even as the ambulances are still arriving or how climate change caused those tornadoes at a trailer park in Indiana. Bill Nye the Science Guy blaming your pickup truck for extreme weather.

These are not people who are speaking in good faith. They're not trying to solve problems. They're not even interested in what actually happened. They're lying, they're unscrupulous, and they will say anything if they think it'll make them more powerful. So it's best to ignore them.

On the other hand, and this is also true over time, it is possible to draw legitimate connections between decisions that politicians make and the catastrophes that follow. The rising gas prices, for example. The price of gas in America now qualifies as a catastrophe. That's true. No matter how you feel about carbon emissions, you still probably assumed you'd be able to afford to drive to work every day or take a vacation with your kids this summer or buy dinner in a restaurant once in a while. But now you can't, and gas prices are the reason you can't. Nothing makes the country poorer faster than .

So how did this happen? Well, we're going to let you decide. We're going to play you a tape from a campaign event during the last Democratic presidential primaries in New Hampshire. This video was shot in 2019 at a moment when not a single person in the country really believed that  his party's nomination. So because they gave him no chance, not a lot of people were paying attention when Biden was asked whether he would continue to take donations from the oil and gas industry. Here's how he responded:

""We're going to end fossil fuel."" End Fossil fuel, the basis of the entire American economy? How are we going to do that and why? Biden didn't explain and again, because no one believed he was actually going to win. No one thought to ask. The assumption then was that Biden was only running for president because he was old and sad and didn't know what else to do with his retirement. It's not like he was going to get anywhere. So, Biden kept saying this, not noticed by many. As president, he pledged ""no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period.""

Well, then something unexpected happened.  top donors that they gave the nomination to senile old Joe Biden, and then Biden became president. And then as president, he immediately started doing exactly what he had promised he would do. Biden stopped issuing new permits for oil and gas leases. He canceled federal drilling permits and pipelines. Then, just a month ago, the administration canceled three oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico and then eliminated more than a million acres of potential drilling sites.

Then to cap it off, you may have noticed Joe Biden imposed an oil embargo on Russia, which is one of the world's biggest energy producers because democracy or something. So what happened next? Well, gas went to over $5 a gallon. Inflation exploded. India and China got a whole lot more cheap Russian oil to keep their economies humming. And then the ruble got even stronger than it was before the war in Ukraine. So everyone got rich except us. We got poorer. Those are the facts.

Now, what would you conclude from those facts? Well, you might start to think that Joe Biden had something to do with rising gas prices, because when you restrict the supply of something, when you have less of something, it costs more like oil, for example. Now, this is a principle known to elite professional economists as supply and demand. Less drilling gives you more expensive gasoline.

You might conclude that, but you would be wrong. In fact, if you believe that you're an idiot, you probably still think Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election. You're naive, you're credulous. You're a sap. The truth is much more obvious. Gas prices are high right now because Vladimir Putin made them high. How did Putin do that?

Simple. From his lair in a torture chamber deep beneath Lubyanka prison in Moscow, surrounded by empty vodka bottles and the severed heads of his enemies, Putin signed an executive order raising the price of unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel in the United States. And also, while he was added of cauliflower and Wheat Thins and dimensional lumber and plywood and plumbing parts and fish tacos as well as a whole bunch of other things you buy, in fact, of everything you buy. Vladimir Putin single-handedly caused inflation, high gas prices. He did this on purpose just as he got his orange accomplice elected president, of the United States five years ago. Putin did that.

Why did he do it? As if you even needed to ask. Putin did this because he hates our freedoms. That's why the freedoms that Joe Biden gave us that Putin wants to take away, as Joe Biden himself wrote in a letter today, scolding the oil companies for not selling more oil. ""We're living with the economic challenges that Vladimir Putin's actions have created for American families,"" he said. It's that darn Putin again.

But Biden's got a plan to fight the Slavic cask gas crunch. He's going to impose a new tax on energy that way. Gas prices will drop because when you make something cost more, actually it's cheaper to buy. Does that make sense? Joe Kernen may be the one sane person left on CNBC. Here was his assessment of this:

.  

Oh, Jimmy Carter, another great Democratic leader undone by the Russians in his case, Leonid Brezhnev. In 1980. It turns out, Jimmy Carter did roughly what Joe Biden wants to do. He imposed an excise tax of 70% on the value of oil sales in excess of $12.80. So what happened next?

Well, we know, because it was studied, the Congressional Research Service found that that tax had the effect of crippling domestic oil production by between 1.2 and 8%. Our reliance on foreign oil, meanwhile, went up by as much as 13%. That doesn't really make sense if the point of the tax was only to prevent ""price gouging."" How did this happen?

Well, in 2018, a paper in the journal Economic Policy answered that question. The Journal found that increased taxes on oil have the effect of discouraging oil producers to take risks on oil production. And those risks are actually high. At the Tax Foundation, they found that ""Energy was the most volatile sector of the stock market in the 2010s. So when the pandemic arrived, more than 100 oil companies went bankrupt and the major producers actively rolled back their operations. ""So those are risky investments, whether you agree with them or not. If you make them even riskier, production will decline even more. That seems like the obvious conclusion. And when production declines, prices get higher.

And that seems to be, according to some people, what's happening. The CEO of Chevron, Mike Wirth, whatever you think of Chevron, knows a lot about oil. Just predict that we're quoting. ""I personally don't believe there will be a new petroleum refinery ever built in this country again. What we've seen over the last two years are shutdowns. We've seen refineries close. We've seen units come down. We've seen refineries being repurposed to become bio refineries. We can burn food in our cars. And we live in a world where the policy, the stated policy of the US government is to reduce demand for the products that refiners produce.""

So when you don't allow people to produce something, what they once produce becomes scarce and therefore highly expensive. And if you depend on it every day, you're screwed. That's what they're saying. But of course, that sounds like Russian disinformation. Sounds like something Putin himself wrote.

And indeed, that's what it is. What's really happening, according to our energy secretary, is this:

Oh. Now you may be asking yourself, why would you put someone like that who's never had a real job and achieve precisely nothing in her life and actually doesn't know anything about anything? Why would you put her in a key position like Secretary of Energy? Because she knows the science as she just told you. Sun, wind are the most reliable forms of energy. It's not like clouds could block the sun or the wind might stop blowing. That's insane.

And don't think about nuclear power ramping up domestic energy production. That's what Putin wants you to do. So to keep our democracy safe, we can't do anything that helps Putin. We should tell you that. I know White House officials agree with this, logical as it seems, according to Bloomberg, ""Biden officials privately expressed concern that rather than dissuade the Kremlin as intended, sanctions have instead exacerbated inflation, worsened food insecurity, and pushed ordinary Russians, punished more than Putin or his allies."" Now, you might be tempted to agree with those Biden officials. If you look at this chart showing that the value of the ruble, as we told you, as measured against the dollar, is skyrocketing. So we've helped Putin with the sanctions. Biden promised we would, quote, reduce the ruble to rubble. Cutting Russia off from the rest of the world. Maybe that's why food is so expensive.

Sorry you were repeating Russian disinformation. And yet Jen Psaki said it straight on that months ago. Turns out food is expensive because the meat conglomerates are greedy. They're greedy. They're so greedy they don't want to sell their products. Watch this:

: 

Yeah. So let's get someone who couldn't find a sparkplug on a lawnmower to explain economics to us. Oh, it's greed again. Not a defense of corporate America, which is indeed greedy and dark, that's for sure. But the idea that prices are going up simply because of greed may leave a few links out of the chain.

But Elizabeth Warren buys it completely. Watch this

If we're going to get lectured all the time, can we please get a lecture from someone with an IQ over 100 with some kind of track record of doing something useful over the course of her entire 70 years on the planet? Just for once? Can we get an impressive person to shout at us? No, we can't.

What's interesting is that greed, of course, is causing all this greed that Putin decreed the companies adopt. But it's also true that trucks full of food are being turned away at the U.S.-Canada border so meat can't get to processing plants. Why is this happening? Well, it's happening because of COVID vaccine mandates, which are still being enforced by the Biden administration. And they require unvaccinated drivers to quarantine for 14 days because it's so dangerous. And a lot of drivers can't do that. And by the way, if they did, the contents of their trucks would spoil.

So you might think that might have something to do with the supply chain issues that are making it impossible for you to fill your grocery cart. We're not going to hear that in the media. You know why? Because, like, Big Meat and like Big Oil, like Vladimir Putin himself, according to Joe Biden, the media aren't giving him a fair shake.

I can't complete a sentence, but the reason I can't communicate is because the media aren't sympathetic enough. They're not really on my side. They haven't helped me at all. And you know why? Because they just want to get clicks on the nightly news, which is now some sort of website.

Well, look, we could go on, but the theme is really simple. Nothing is Joe Biden's fault – not gas prices, not media prices, meat prices, not the media's coverage of inflation. None of it. You know whose fault it is? It is Vladimir Putin's fault. According to Sandy Cortez, actually, you can blame White supremacists, too, and that may be exactly the same as Putin. That's the reason, White supremacy, that we only have 12 years to live. Watch this.

So the descendant of conquistadors is once again lecturing you about racism. Who cares? Sandy Cortez. It's easy to mock her. On the other hand, open your mind. Larry Summers just told us that January 6 caused inflation. He once ran Harvard. He's a very smart man, despite his repulsive table manners. So the idea that your racism is making the planet warmer isn't actually that far out is plausible. We can't say – we're not scientists.

The one thing we can say for sure at this point is that the people who screwed everything up are in no way responsible for what they did legally or morally. In fact, they're blameless. So we can tell you that with confidence, because the one thing we know for sure is that Vladimir Putin did it.

Shut up, traitor. He did.

680	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-faucis-covid-infection-means	2022-06-16 22:27:00	Tucker Carlson: What Fauci's COVID infection means | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out COVID-infected Dr. Anthony Fauci's handling of the pandemic and critiques his past comments on the virus on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

 in the news. One thing few people know about Fauci, when he says he knows medicine, he's definitely right. He's been around for a long time. Tony Fauci graduated from medical school almost sixty years ago. He's 81. That means he's three years older than the average life expectancy of an American man. It means he's 16 years past the age at which the average physician in this country retires. 

We're not calling Tony Fauci old, but at this point, he's probably not buying any long-term municipal bonds. If you were his investment adviser, you'd tell him to day trade. Yet, Tony Fauci is still working. In fact, he's one of the longest-serving employees in the entire federal government. He's almost certainly the highest-paid. Why is that? Because Tony Fauci is that good. The term ""national treasure"" comes to mind.  

Decent people understand that. Drive through any neighborhood with high concentrations of college-educated professionals with desperately unhappy personal lives and you will see the yard signs shrines erected in Fauci's honor. ""Thank you, Dr. Fauci!"" they read, capped with a perky little exclamation point with a heart at the bottom, ""Thank you for being you.""

And you can actually understand their gratitude. Fauci is the man who got us through the pandemic as the coronavirus wafted from a Chinese military biolab in Wuhan and settled over the United States. Tony Fauci was the man Americans look to for guidance. He was our Sherpa, our diminutive spirit guide. ""Do these masks actually work?"" we wondered. ""No, they don't,"" Dr. Fauci replied firmly. 

""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" he told ""60 Minutes"" in March of 2020, but that turned out to be not quite accurate. In fact, there was a reason to walk around in a mask, but it had nothing to do with public health. The experience of being forcibly masked was so unpleasant and so humiliating it distracted you from other questions, such as ""Where did this virus come from anyway?"" 

As someone who had helped fund the development of COVID with your tax dollars, Fauci was strongly in favor of you being distracted, so he soon changed the guidance. He upped it soon. Soon Fauci was demanding that we mask up, including outdoors and exercising, even alone in your car, and so we did.  

By January of 2021, even that guidance had proved to be inadequate because people are still persistently asking, ""Where the hell this virus come from?"" So, Fauci had go further. He declared that Americans must wear two masks, one on top of the other, with no air holes to breathe. This, he said, was ""common sense,"" so a lot of people did it. But Fauci didn't rest there. By December of 2020, he had checked with science and concluded that actually one of the main risk factors for COVID-19 was your family's ancient religious observances. Those are the real problem, so Tony Fauci went on NBC News to cancel Christmas. 

That was a tough one for a lot of people, even the double-masked ones. Americans love Christmas. They love their families. Many of them still love God, but Fauci had spoken. Science had spoken. No more Christmas. So, countless Americans spent Christmas morning alone. But still, it wasn't enough. In the end. Dr. Fauci looked around this country and saw people making human connections, experiencing warmth and intimacy with one another in the middle of a global pandemic. Talk about reckless.

So, Fauci stamped it out. ""Going forward,"" he told us, ""You must never shake hands with another human being. That is, if you don't want to die drowning in your own fluids in a COVID ward."" 

Oh, there weren't complete lockdowns in this country. But in fact, there were. Most people obeyed, but not everyone. Some people persisted in shaking hands with one another or even celebrating Christmas. Others wore only a single mask and those people, we can report with mixed feelings, died, and they died alone because due to science, Tony Fauci prevented their loved ones from seeing them, from holding their hands in their final moments on Earth. But it was all necessary because there was a global pandemic.  

In the end, you will recall that Tony Fauci realized, as a scientist does sometimes, based on research, that only Big Pharma could save us. We couldn't do it ourselves. We are too weak and selfish. We needed Pfizer. The entire country was going to have to get the COVID shot, every one of us and anyone who refused would be crushed, yelled at, ostracized, fired. 

In the affluent neighborhoods, the place where people believe in science (""In this house, they believe in science’) places like Bethesda, Brooklyn and Aspen, the population gratefully complied, but in the rest of the country, there remained cells of ignorance and superstition where people resisted the vaccine. 

Strangely, at the same time, many of these primitive people also had, somehow, high skilled, highly essential jobs, including in health care. They were nurses, they were EMTs, they were airline pilots and cops and Navy SEALs, but they were all summarily fired. Their careers and lives destroyed. But it wasn't sad. It was necessary because they were killing the rest of us. As Dr. Fauci told us, there were two things we needed to know about this pandemic of the unvaccinated and the COVID shot that could fix it. First was the vaccine absolutely prevents COVID infection. Watch.  

""When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe, that they are not going to get infected."" Simple, so take the shot and you're never getting COVID. Done. We'll get it. The second thing that Dr. Fauci told us was that Pfizer had made something far more impressive than your own body. Pfizer was smarter than nature.  was a joke compared to the COVID vaccine.  

""Vaccines can do better than nature. That's why this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" That was Dr. Fauci's message and still his message, despite the fact that yesterday – and here's the news in the story – Dr. Fauci announced that he himself has been . That's right.  

Dr. Fauci is COVID positive, despite double masking outside, despite skipping Christmas, despite his strict regimen of celibacy and no handshaking, despite four separate COVID vaccine shots. Dr. Fauci got sick anyway. Now, this seems like an important moment. What does it mean? Well, if you live in Bethesda and have a Fauci sign in your yard, you know exactly what it means. It means we need more vaccines. Pfizer is still the answer because Pfizer is always the answer.

Fauci delivered that message today without flinching.  

  

Okay, so testifying on the need for vaccines from isolation, having been infected after getting four of them. ""We need to both prevent infection and transmission."" 

""But wait a second,"" said skeptics who don't live in Bethesda with Fauci yard signs, ""Weren't the first four vaccine shots supposed to prevent infection transmission? Isn't that why you fired all those nurses and pilots and Navy SEALs? Shouldn't you acknowledge the lie you told for years and apologize to them, give them back their jobs with damages and grovel before them begging for forgiveness before you move on to yet another mandatory vaccine?"" 

""And while we're at it,"" the skeptics pointed out, ""Can you tell us, Dr. Fauci, how many Americans have been killed or seriously injured by the first shots that you mandated? Well, many thousands, we know that, but how many exactly? Is anyone even keeping track?"" 

Researchers at the CDC, along with scientists at Emory, Vanderbilt and Duke, recently concluded the mRNA vaccine significantly increased the risk of potentially fatal heart damage in young men. So, Dr. Fauci, what exactly is the cost benefit analysis here on giving that vaccine to young men? Be specific.  

Now, a normal bureaucrat would have withered under questions like that, but not Fauci. Fauci is a man of science. In fact, he is science, as he once explained. Science and Fauci are identical. You'll never see them together in the same room. There's a reason for that. So, Fauci didn't bend. He doubled down, pressing for the mass vaccination of all American children over five.

Watch here his bravery in the face of harassment from Rand Paul, who is also technically a doctor, but a skeptical one and therefore anti-science.

  

  

Notice the brilliant facility with language here. Dr. Fauci doesn't actually answer the question. Instead, he dismisses it out of hand in a very scientific way as ""absurd."" That's how a scientist talks. Questions about efficacy, whether the drugs you prescribe actually work, mean nothing compared to questions about federal funding. Federal funding is what matters to a scientist. 

In fact, federal funding was the whole point of Fauci's testimony today. He was there to let Congress know that as a man who's been vaccinated four times and still got COVID, he can tell you firsthand, we're never going to beat COVID without more vaccines and to get that vaccine, we're going to send billions more tax dollars to Tony Fauci. There's no way around it. It's science.

But still, Rand Paul clearly more a witch doctor than a physician, wasn't fully convinced. ""Where's all this money going?"" Rand Paul asked, ""Are you getting any of it?"" Watch Dr. Fauci's brilliance on display as he answers that question.  

  

""Are you getting rich from these vaccines?"" Rand Paul asked. Fauci's reply: ""You know, I don't know as a fact."" 

""You know. I don't know is a fact."" Now, what does that mean? ""You know, I don't know as a fact."" Well, honestly, we don't know what that means. No one knows what that means. It is impenetrable, like a Zen cone. It's the sound of one hand clapping and that's why it's brilliant. In any case, we are getting new vaccines, of course we are, whether Tony Fauci is profiting personally from them or no.  

It really doesn't matter, though, as his fans, we hope he is, and of course the vaccine makers will need another dose of legal immunity in the extremely unlikely event their experimental drugs were to kill thousands more Americans whose deaths are then covered up and forgotten. That's just common sense, as Dr. Fauci would say. Another round of shots for everyone. We've got to beat this pandemic.

Now, we haven't seen polls on it yet, but there's no question Americans are going to be thrilled by this news when they hear it. We reached out to Justin Bieber tonight for comment, but unfortunately, his face is paralyzed, so he couldn't respond. We'll tell you when he gets back to us.

There's a big push in the U.S. Senate to do something about so-called gun crime. If you had a map of gun crime (that is crimes committed with guns, crimes which people die by gunshot) you would notice that they are clustered in cities. That's where the overwhelming majority of gun crime takes place

But the Senate isn't trying to do anything about that. Instead, Democrats have decided this is a perfect opportunity in the wake of  to disarm you and the amazing thing is, Mitch McConnell, the head Republican in the Senate, is on their side completely, and he's rounded up a group of 10 Republicans who can help him.  

So, the backbone of this package of legislation they're trying to get through is something called a  and in one sentence, a red flag law would allow the government to confiscate your firearms without even charging you with a crime, much less convicting you of one. 

So, who are these Republicans? Well, the lead is John Cornyn of Texas and the amazing thing about John Cornyn is he admits he doesn't care about gun crimes committed by actual criminals. We know this from a piece in Axios, and we're quoting: ""Senator John Kennedy asked Cornyn during one lunch, 'Are we focused on gang violence in inner-city murders?' And the response was, 'No, we're not focusing on that'."" 

Well, if you're not focusing on that, why are you doing this exactly? We don't need to guess about where gun crime comes from. Here's a montage of some of the crimes that John Cornyn can't be bothered with.  

  

Crime is a complicated thing, but the crime spike that we're seeing now is not complicated at all. Prosecutors across the country are refusing to enforce laws that we already have and when you do that, crime spikes. So, if you’re in the United States Senate, if you're John Cornyn from Texas, supposedly a free state of Texas, you'd probably want to do something about that. But no, John Cornyn has decided to take guns from lawful gun owners, and if there's one reason you vote Republican, it's to prevent that. 

So, it's not surprising that John Cornyn is very unpopular with Republican voters. Watch his reception today at the Texas Republican Convention. Listen for the boos.  

 Go back home!

Happy Monday, if you could call it that. But you can't. Like most Americans, you're probably still trying to digest what has happened over these past four days. Profound national trauma is like that. Once you face something unimaginably horrible, nothing is ever the same. Nothing will ever be the same. Like prison, it changes a man.  

This is not an easy time for any of us. We get it. We're literally –   – still shaking as we think about how close this country came to losing our democracy last Thursday. Last Thursday was June 16th, a day forever branded in our memory, a day that has joined the pantheon of tragic turning points in human history. Where were you on 6/16? You'll never forget and neither will we. At the time, we were preparing a show on Tony Fauci and his push for a new Corona shot for kids. It seemed important then. It seems so trivial now. 

As we were speaking on the air at that very moment, a team of seven saboteurs had entered the Capitol grounds and then proceeded, as saboteurs do, to breach the Capitol itself. Inside those hallowed grounds, within the very womb of democracy, these wreckers began their hunt for sitting members of Congress. That happened, ladies and gentlemen, and if it sounds shocking to you, it gets more harrowing from there. 

This was not some spontaneous outbreak of insurrection. No, this was a meticulously planned coup from afar. The group in the Capitol was under the direct control of an extremist called Stephen Colbert, who as a White man, is, by definition a White extremist.  

This White extremist, , had a fifth column within the Capitol to help him pull off his diabolical plan. He had members of Congress in his employ. Members of Congress who, believe it or not, helped the insurrectionists enter the Capitol, just open the doors and let them walk in. Yes, that can happen and that fifth column included Adam Schiff of California, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, and a new member called Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, besmirching his family name. Those three members of Congress allowed the wreckers inside the Longworth House Office Building. 

While inside, the insurrectionists tried to gain access to a restricted area, but they were thwarted by brave law enforcement who arrived, risking their very lives to remove the insurrectionists from the premises. But it wasn't enough because hours later, an aide to Congressman Auchincloss secretly permitted the insurrectionists to reenter the Capitol complex. And then around 8:30 p.m., they cause some kind of disturbance. The details are murky as of tonight, but according to one report, they were banging on windows inside the Capitol, trashing the place, committing violence against our democracy. And for that, apparently, we are hearing tonight, they were put in jail, but within hours they were out again.  

Now, the man who controlled this attempted to coup, Stephen Colbert, knew exactly what he was doing. He knew the stakes. He knew the crimes he was committing and we know that because just last year, this White extremist, Stephen Colbert, explained that grown men who unlawfully enter the Capitol to harass sitting members of Congress are not pranksters. They're not protesters. They're domestic terrorists.  

Oh, it's shocking. These are domestic terrorists. Stephen Colbert, in what the literary community refers to as foreshadowing, described his own coup, and yet Stephen Colbert somehow still has access to the airwaves and to digital media, spreading his hate unfettered, convincing future generations of insurrectionists to do what his team of saboteurs did last week. That must stop. People who plan coups must be silenced.  

There's recent precedent for that, and anyone who disagrees should be disconnected from Amazon Web Services immediately. No spreading hate, but stopping White extremist Stephen Colbert from passing on his message of insurrection to the country won't solve what the rest of us are living with and that's trauma and like all trauma, journalists are affected most profoundly.  

We're scarred by what we saw. We're all Kasie Hunt tonight. It'll be a long time before we can revisit the Capitol building, before we can forget where we were when democracy shook on its very foundations. It's going to take therapy. It's going to take a lot of support from our fellow survivors before we can recapture the carefree innocence that Stephen Colbert stole from us, before we can feel safe again. We're not alone in our despair tonight. 

Yeah, journalists feel this stuff deeply. People say, ""Oh, you're just robots, just automatons inert, hardened, callous to the news. You don't feel."" But we do. We do feel. You see something like that. You see an insurrection take place before your very eyes and it hurts you. It changes you. You're not the same person. How long will it take to heal? It's impossible to know. CNN just interviewed a Rolling Stone journalist who, after a year and a half after the last insurrection, still hasn't healed. Watch.  

  

Now you look at something like that and you're tempted to dismiss it out of hand, ""Oh, you're having trouble sleeping? You sob for no reason? Well, that's because you have a barren, personal life. You're celibate. You're only meaningful human contact comes from the Uber Eats guy. You live out your emotional life on Netflix. That's your core problem. It couldn't really be an insurrection that made you cry.""  

Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, stop ""or disrupted your sleep,"" but it can. For a journalist, this stuff hurts, but if you think it's bad for us in the news media, what do you think it was like for the lawmakers who were trapped inside Thursday night? In the last insurrection, even though she was nowhere near the Capitol – she was probably getting her nails done, but it didn't matter – Sandy Cortez nearly died. 

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has given a harrowing account of her experience on January 6. 

A harrowing and emotional account of what happened to her during the Capitol riot. 

""Boom, boom, boom!"" That's what an insurrection looks like, but there's no charade-like miming they can't ever fully express the pain inside. We're going to deal with that in our quiet alone time, possibly wearing an upscale turtleneck. We'll let you know. But the question is, once we've had an act of war like this, how does the country respond? How do we all respond? ""Boom, boom, boom!"" as Sandy would say. 

Well, obviously, we need a commission, of course, and a criminal investigation. There's probably one underway, by the way and then a day of remembrance, because you can't let the memory die. So, who's going to lead this? Well, the obvious candidates, Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and speaking of crying, Adam Kinzinger. 

They're the naturals. We called them today to see what they're planning. How are we going to commemorate this latest insurrection? They haven't gotten back to us yet, probably sleeping or weeping. But we can assume from past experience that Adam Kinzinger feels this really deeply, really deeply. Watch. 

Yeah, Adam Kinzinger is right and we 've made fun of him in the past like a grown dude crying on TV. We mocked that. We apologized. Adam Kinzinger, we can recover. But there's only one path toward recovery and if you talk to any recovery expert, they will tell you the way to recover is to viciously punish the people who hurt your feelings—step one. It's always step one. 

So, we're going to have to mete out some pretty serious punishment. Stephen Colbert's team of insurrectionists have been jailed for one night. That's not a lot. The penalty for insurrection is death. We're not calling for that here. This is a moderate show. These are our fellow Americans. We owe them a second chance. Thankfully, there's recent precedent to help guide an appropriate punishment.

683	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-difference-crime-between-colbert-staffers-jan-6-protesters	2022-06-21 22:48:00	Tucker Carlson: What's the difference in crime between Colbert staffers and Jan 6 protesters? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips comedian Stephen Colbert following the arrest of his several staffers for breaching the Capitol on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

So last Thursday, last week on Thursday, talk show host  a group of seven of his employees to Washington, D.C. Their job? Break into the U.S. Capitol complex and harass lawmakers inside. So, the group dutifully arrived in the afternoon and were met almost immediately by uniformed Capitol Hill police officers who threw them out. But apparently on orders from Colbert, they returned.  

At about 4 p.m. on Thursday, the group reentered the building. Accounts vary as to what exactly happened next, but it seems clear that Colbert's employees were led inside by an ally within the building, that would be a freshman member of Congress from Massachusetts called Jake Auchincloss.  

Once on federal property, Colbert's employees did what they came to do, which was disrupt the business of Congress, and apparently they were not subtle about doing it. They pounded on doors and yelled. Whatever they did, it got people's attention. It takes an awful lot for a police force controlled by Nancy Pelosi to arrest a group of left-wing entertainment figures, but that's exactly what happened next. Capitol Hill police arrested seven Colbert employees and brought them to jail. All seven of them were charged with unlawful entry.  

Now, that's the identical charge that hundreds of January 6 defendants have been prosecuted for. But unlike the January 6 defendants,  for a year and a half in solitary confinement. No, they were released after only a night behind bars, and then they fled back to New York. Why is that? What exactly is the difference in the crime? As a legal question, we still don't know the answer. For some reason, Capitol Hill police have not released the surveillance tapes that would show exactly what Colbert's employees did that so triggered the police force controlled by Nancy Pelosi that they were arrested, but whatever they did. Otherwise, sympathetic members of Congress are running away from it as quickly as they can.  

""We do not condone any inappropriate activity within the Capitol,"" Jake Auchincloss’ office told us today. It was a factual matter. That is not true. In fact, Jake Auchincloss has a recent history of condoning criminal behavior in the Capitol. Just this March, surveillance cameras in the complex caught Jake Auchincloss’ chief of staff, that would be a former Adam Schiff staffer called Tim Hyssop, vandalizing the front door of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greens Personal Office.  

Hyssop did this not once but several times violently, like a man obsessed. Capitol Hill police quickly filed an arrest warrant against him because Tim Haysom clearly posed a threat to a member of Congress. But Jake Auchincloss did not fire him. Instead, Jake Auchincloss defended Hyssop’s vandalism as noble and justified. ""Our office is not going to apologize,"" read a long and self-righteous statement from Jake Auchincloss.  

In other words, ""We don't like Marjorie Taylor Greene's politics. Therefore, we can do whatever we want to her and we will."" For the most part, the media ignored the story. So, Jake Auchincloss and Adam Schiff felt emboldened to go further. They invited  to harass Marjorie Taylor Greene some more, which is what they were trying to do when they were arrested by Capitol Hill Police.  

Now, whatever you think of her politics, Marjorie Taylor Greene is a sitting member of Congress. Preventing her or any other member of Congress from carrying out official duties as a public representative is, by definition, an attack on democracy. So, how is what Stephen Colbert did different from what the protesters on January 6 have been convicted of doing? That's a very good question and it's a question that Colbert himself spent the weekend thinking about.  

His conclusion? Well, unlike Trump voters, Stephen Colbert is a very good person. Therefore, any comparison to Trump voters is not simply ridiculous. It is a moral crime. Watch.  

Yeah, it was a toy dog. ""It's shameful."" In other words, ""When you criticize me, you're really criticizing the brave Capitol Police officers who arrested the people who worked for me, the ones who committed the crimes I asked them to commit and I, for one, will not stand for that."" That's what he just said.  

Now, what you have there is not so much an explanation. In fact, it doesn't explain anything. Instead, it's a master's class on whiny, rich, liberal self-righteousness. It's a distillation of a worldview that is so concise and so perfect, it is certain to be studied by cultural historians of the future, seeking to understand how our civilization collapsed.  

""Not only am I not sorry, you're the criminal for bringing it up. Stop hitting me,"" he screams as he punches you in the face. That is passive aggression taken to the level of art. In any way, Colbert says, ""Shut up. I'm a comedian with a toy dog, you can't criticize me."" So, the question really is, is Stephen Colbert a comedian? Well, if you're one of the relatively few people still watching Stephen Colbert’s show on CBS, you'll have to admit it is hard to tell. Most nights, Stephen Colbert sounds like the notably unfunny Karine Jean-Pierre. He sounds like a Biden flack delivering whatever talking points the White House tells him to repeat and if you doubt that, here's what it looks like. 

  

""Get the vax, peasants, surrender your guns, support Ukraine and remember, it's called Kiev now."" This isn't comedy. It's a very sad midlife crisis, but more than that, it's information war being waged against television viewers on behalf of the Democratic Party. At least when the White House press secretary does it, she admits what she's doing. Colbert hides behind his former job as a comedian. ""It was all a joke. When people I don't like break into the Capitol, it's insurrection. When we do it, it's sketch comedy, right?"" 

It's getting harder to maintain that lie and here's how, you know, comedians have a sense of humor. It is, in fact, a job requirement, but Stephen Colbert does not. Stephen Colbert has lost his sense of humor along with the critical distance and perspective that make humor possible. At this point, he's just a partisan scold, and you know that for certain, because even as he watched the QAnon Shaman parade around the Capitol on January 6, Stephen Colbert did not laugh.  

Now, an actual comedian whatever is politics would have found that spectacle hilarious because—let's be honest—it was.  

  

  

""Hey,"" say the guy in the bear skin and the horn hat. That's not hilarious? Yes, it is hilarious. ""No, he's a seditious insurrectionist,"" said Colbert, ""He needs to go to jail. He's a terrorist,"" and when he was sent to jail, Colbert applauded.  

Now, that's how Maoist countries act. That's not how comedians act. So, Stephen Colbert may be a late-night host still for some reason, but he has zero sense of humor. He ought to step aside and let some young person who still gets the joke to have the job, but he won't. Here's Colbert on November 6, 2020. Watch.  

Those were real tears, the only real thing about that show. We're not trying to belabor the point, but the guy's not a comedian. You watch a comedian, you think, ""that guy's hilarious, I'd love to meet him."" 

Imagine eating a meal with Stephen Colbert. Chances are you somehow offend him over the course of a typical dinner by saying something he finds offensive. What are the chances of that? 100%. Stephen Colbert is a Karen. He's a brittle, middleaged woman who's always lecturing you about something. In fact, he's Elizabeth Warren. They even look alike. Have you seen them in the same room recently? No. 

Sad, he was talented at one point and so was Robert Smigel. That's one of the coal bear employees who was also arrested last week. Simel's been doing his dog puppet routine for 30 years. That's the one that Colbert is now hiding behind."" It was just a dog puppet.""  

The dog puppet was kind of funny during the Clinton administration. It is pure hackery now. Smigel keeps going because he's got a political message for him.  

""I'm going to beat you over the head with my political message."" No one laughs at Robert Smigel anymore. It's pathetic.  

Who's funnier: Robert Smigel, or the guy who took pictures of himself at Nancy Pelosi's desk on January 6? Be honest, it's not even close. The guy at Pelosi's desk is hilarious compared to the guy with the talking dog and none of them is half as funny. Again, sorry it's true as Donald Trump and how do you know that? Show us the late night host who said anything half as amusing as Trump's Taco Bowl tweet.  

Ever? Any of them? No, never. These people are so afraid. They're so terrified, holding onto their stupid jobs late into middle age, that how do they respond to Cinco de Mayo? Fawning over the indigenous cuisine of the Latinx community. Nobody likes that and that's why in the end,  has not a single Hispanic viewer. His audience is entirely self-hating White liberals like him. 

So, nobody watches anymore. That's fine. That's CBS's problem. But don't tell us you're a comedian and therefore exempt from the normal rules of behavior and the normal federal laws about trespassing because you're not. You did what they did, and you should be punished in exactly the same way.

 of our lifetime. He's also the most destructive. Now, that's not a partisan assessment. That's not the opinion of a right-wing talk show. That is the view of the overwhelming majority of American voters.  

Biden's malicious ineptitude is so overwhelming that it is single-handedly changing American politics and everywhere there are signs of it, signs of a massive generational realignment taking shape, taking shape in response to the disasters this administration has created. The old coalitions are crumbling before our eyes. Suddenly we're seeing Hispanic voters, African and Middle Eastern immigrants, as well as huge numbers of Americanborn young men, all running at remarkable speed from Joe Biden and the anti-human corporate neoliberalism he represents.  

Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. That's a place which for generations has been a Democratic Party stronghold. As recently as 2018, a Democrat called Henry Cuellar won his district in south Texas with fully 84% of the vote. His district is 80% Hispanic and for decades that meant it went Democrat. But then last cycle, that began to change. Two years ago, Cuellar's percentage of the vote plummeted by 26 points in one cycle. The same thing happened to Congressman Filemon Vela and Vicente Gonzalez. They also represent districts on the border with Mexico in Texas.  

Both went from huge wins in 2018 to marginal victories in 2020. Hispanic voters are no longer automatically Democrats. In fact, they are openly hostile to the Democratic Party. Joe Biden's support among Hispanics has dropped to a stunning 24%. That's the lowest among any ethnic group in America. 

Last week, a candidate called Mayra Flores soundly defeated incumbent Filemon Vela in a special election in the Rio Grande Valley. It was the first time the district has gone Republican in more than 100 years. Later in the show, we're going to speak to Flores about her win and what it means.

But it's not just Hispanics who have come to despise the Democratic Party. 

Roughly 9 out of 10 Black voters supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Since then, less than two years,  among African-Americans has dropped by 20 percentage points and the same is true with Asian voters. As of tonight, the only group that continues to enthusiastically support Joe Biden is college-educated White voters in urban areas, particularly middle-aged women with unhappy personal lives. If you've got more than three cats in an NPR tote bag and wear a mask alone in the car, you are all-in. Everyone else is running away. Effectively, what we're seeing is the end of the modern Democratic Party. Even MSNBC has noticed.  

Barack Obama got more than 60% of the vote in that district. Now, it's Republican. This is an historic moment. Joe Biden has destroyed the Democratic coalition. So, the question is, since we have only two political parties, how are Republican leaders responding to this fact, to this opportunity? Are they making the case for a better way? Are they offering an alternative to what the Democrats have brought this country? No, they're not. They're doing something you never would have expected. Republican leaders are siding with Joe Biden.  

At the very moment that Joe Biden is at his weakest, months before a pivotal midterm election, Republicans are propping him up. They are saving Biden from himself. Since the day Biden was elected, Republicans in Washington have taken Biden's side on virtually every significant item in his policy agenda. That would include: COVID restrictions, vaccine mandates, transgender ideology in school, sanctions against China, the January 6 charade, free speech, civil liberties, spying by the Intel agencies, preserving the big tech monopolies, the anti-White race politics of CRT and Juneteenth, border enforcement and energy policy, and above all, the administration's signature issue: its lunatic and reckless support for the war on Ukraine. Republicans are all-n.  

""It's called Kyiv now."" That's the Republican message heading into the midterm elections. ""It's called Kyiv"" and by the way, this isn't just happening in Washington. It is endemic among the leaders of solidly Republican states. In fact, the more Republican the state, the more liberal the governor tends to be. The governor of Texas, which has some of the biggest oil and gas deposits in the world, has decided to build windmills that don't work. The governor of Utah, a state where Joe Biden got 37% of the vote, that governor begins conversations by announcing his preferred pronouns. He really does. Watch.  

It goes on and on and on. The governor of South Dakota, where Joe Biden got 35% of the total vote less than two years ago, that governor tried to let female impersonators destroy women's sports in South Dakota. In Texas, both senators can't stop talking about how great Juneteenth is. In Arkansas, one of the most conservative states in the country, the governor supports the chemical castration of children.  

When you vote Republican in Arkansas, you're voting for the castration of children. How many Republican voters in Arkansas knew that when they voted for the Republican governor? But it's everywhere. Apart from Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida, very few Republican officeholders are pushing back in any way against anything Joe Biden is doing. 

In fact, they're abetting what he's doing. Effectively they're coming to Joe Biden's rescue. Why are they doing this? Why do you think they're doing it? Because fundamentally, they're on Joe Biden's side. Whatever stylistic differences Republicans in Washington may have with Democrats, and there are some, in the end, Mitch McConnell has far more in common with Chuck Schumer than he does with your average Republican voter.  

Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer are united in their fear of populism and in their gutlevel loathing of the American public and they're not alone. What Washington fears most is democracy – that is letting voters have what they want. That's not allowed. Republicans and Democrats have formed a uniparty specifically to prevent it. You see this everywhere, but you see it most clearly in the gun control legislation that's in the Senate right now. 

So, you saw what happened in Uvalde. What's the real lesson there? Well, the lesson is that cowardice kills. In a crisis bravery is essential. Oh, but that's a masculine virtue and it was nowhere in evidence in Uvalde. The police there were cowards. They could have saved the lives of many of those children. They refused to do it. The door to the classroom where the shooter was holed up, killing kids was unlocked. Police with rifles were in the hallway 3 minutes after the shooting began, but they didn't even bother to check the door. Instead, they let a teenage lunatic murder those kids, and they detained and stopped anyone who tried to rescue those kids. 

During the killing, one of the teachers inside, a woman called Eva Mireles, called her husband. She said she'd been shot and she said she was dying. Now, her husband happened to be a police officer. His name is Ruben Ruiz, and he sped to the scene and he tried to save her, but police were already there, disarmed him and prevented him from going inside to save his wife and the children. 

""(Ruiz) tried to move forward into the hallway,"" the Texas DPS director said. ""He was detained and they took his gun away from him and escorted him off the scene."" 

Result? His wife died inside the school and so did so many children. Now, none of this is hidden. We saw it happen and we know it's true and yet, bravery is not the lesson anyone in Washington is taking from this. The lesson that Mitch McConnell draws from Uvalde is that we must ignore the details of what actually happened there and ignore the gun crime in the cities where it's actually taking place, ignore all of that, and instead disarm law-abiding citizens who have not been charged with any crime. Here's Mitch McConnell.  

""I'll be supportive."" How many people who voted for Mitch McConnell in Kentucky are supportive of this? 20%? That may be high, but yesterday, just a few hours after the text of this gun confiscation bill was released, the Senate voted on it, just a few hours. Why? Well, John Cornyn said there was simply no time to allow anyone to read the bill, even people voting on it, or to try to understand what was in it. A reporter last night overheard John Cornyn again, the senator from Texas, a Republican, say this and we're quoting, ""It's only 80 pages long. How long do you need to read it?"" Then John Cornyn appeared in front of cameras to explain the Senate cannot pass this bill soon enough. Watch.  

This is grotesque. Under ordinary circumstances, you would just assume, as always, these people live in their own hermetically sealed world. They have no contact with reality. They have no idea how out of step they are. But given the context of this moment, you have to interpret it differently. What you just saw was effectively a speech in support of Joe Biden by a leader in a party whose job it is to offer an alternative to Joe Biden. It's enough to make your head spin. 

Just a few hours after Cornyn said that, the Senate voted to move forward with this bill. So, what's in the bill? Well, there's $100 million for the FBI, for the FBI. No attempt to reform the FBI. We're shoveling another $100 million to the FBI, the personal police department of Joe Biden, the people who saved his son from a drug charge. 

Then there's nearly a billion in order to bribe the states to ""implement and manage"" these so-called red flag laws. Now, these laws allow authorities to seize firearms for people who have committed no crimes. That's a violation of due process. It's unconstitutional, but the Republican Party is all for it. The bill also makes it harder for people between the ages of 18 and 21 to buy a gun. They can go fight in Ukraine and Republicans would like them to, but they can't get a gun in this country. Now, the question is, would any of these measures have stopped the ? 

No, this bill is completely unconnected from what happened in Buffalo or Uvalde. This is merely Joe Biden's agenda. Even Kevin McCarthy of California has refused to support it. So here you have Mitch McConnell, the lead Republican in the Senate, partnering with Chuck Schumer, the lead Democrat in the Senate, picking John Cornyn to carry that message and getting it done before anyone can even read the bill and then on the Senate floor, John Cornyn turns to one of the most partisan Democrats in that body, Alex Padilla of California, and says, ""Next, we'll do immigration."" 

Now, he was caught saying this, so Cornyn's office came out today and said, oh, it's just a hilarious joke. Get it? First, we'll take your guns, then we'll send your tax dollars to Zelenskyy in Ukraine, a country you can't find out a map, and then we're going to give amnesty to tens of millions of illegal aliens living illegally in this country. To John Cornyn, it's all pretty funny. Does anyone who voted for John Cornyn in the state of Texas, the Republicans in Texas agree that it's funny? Or even believe that it was a joke? How about the voters of South Carolina, Lindsey Graham's voters?  

After meeting in his office with a movie star to discuss the issue – they're pretty informed –  Lindsey Graham also voted for gun confiscation last night, not in Ukraine. He voted to send more guns to Ukraine, but you can't have guns here. You Ukrainian? No? No guns for you and at the same time, as we said, Lindsey Graham is telling you your moral duty is to support a country you can't locate on a map, but your Bill of Rights, your constitutional protections are no longer valid and there is nothing we shouldn't do for Kyiv. Not for Texas, for Kyiv. Here's Lindsey Graham.  

So, the priorities they articulate in public are so far from the priorities of Americans that you have to wonder what this is. It's not simply a betrayal of Republican voters. We often call it that. It's much more. It's a declaration of war against Republican voters, in fact, against voters. For the record, here's a complete list of the Republican senators who just voted for gun confiscation.  

They would include Senator John Cornyn of Texas, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio, Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia (How do the West Virginians feel?) Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was absent for the vote, but he came out in support of it.  

Now, many of those senators are from America's most conservative states—Indiana, Utah, Louisiana and West Virginia. What were the numbers in the last election in those states? In fact, every one of those states, except for the state of Maine, went for Donald Trump in 2020. You're seeing the color-coded maps of election results in those states on your screen right now. Some of them are entirely red. 

So again, if you care about democracy, you have to ask how many of those voters went to the polls in the last election, hoping above all, to elect leaders who support gun confiscation of law-abiding Americans, red flag laws? Not very many. So, what we're seeing here, to be clear, is a subversion of democracy. 

You get to vote for whoever you want in this country. It can be a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or conservative, but in the end, you're going to get the very same thing every time. You're going to get a weaker U.S. dollar. You're going to get more pointless foreign wars and you're going to get a lower standard of living for the middle class. 

In America, as in Western Europe, there's only one flavor of politics allowed, and that is corporate politics just as there's only one flavor of media allowed, which is corporate media and those two forces work together toward the same goal: more power for them, less power for you; fewer families, more dollar stores; less choice, more coercion; less diversity, more sameness. Sound familiar? That's the Chinese model. But for Mitch McConnell, whose family, like so many families in Washington, has become rich from its ties to the Chinese government, it seems normal, but it's not normal.  

This level of disconnection from what voters actually want is dangerous and it's destabilizing. Self-government is what keeps countries calm and stable. Democracy is a pressure relief valve. Don't storm the Bastille, vote. If you take that away or if you strip it of its meaning, people become angry and frustrated and over time they become revolutionary and everyone in Washington knows this.  

So, no wonder they want to disarm you. You can't have guns because they no longer trust you and they no longer trust you because they know they've betrayed you. This is how democracy dies, not in darkness, but in plain sight, live on C-SPAN.

The true measure of character, a wise man once said, it's not whether you make a mistake – all of us do – but whether you learn from that mistake. With those words in mind, we'd like to begin tonight with an admission. It's contrition night on Fox News. It is time to reassess our view of .  

Now, if you watch the show, you know that for more than a year now, we've had a pretty conventional understanding of this country's first Black/Indian/part Canadian vice president who also happens to identify as a woman. Now, we've assumed that Kamala Harris was historically unpopular because she's historically incompetent and fake. We assume she earned her low approval numbers. We're not alone in that. Lots of other people have come to the very same conclusion.  d

There's currently a debate among software engineers about whether Harris is even of biological origin or instead the product of a classified government A.I. project gone wrong. We don't know the answer, but we certainly understand the question. She's that synthetic. So again, until the other day, we assumed that people don't like Kamala Harris because she's highly unlikable. Keep in mind that even her own husband kisses her with a mask on. To us, that seemed like a pretty clear sign. But we're here tonight to tell you that assumptions can change, even assumptions rooted in overwhelming evidence and observable reality.  

Sometimes, and this happens, your entire worldview can flip upside down instantly, invert in a flash of light – ask Saul of Tarsus. Our road to Damascus experience came and we saw this clip of Joy Reid from MSNBC doing a drive time radio show. Watching it, we realized the problem isn't Kamala Harris. The problem is us. So, take a look at this. Open your mind a little bit and see if you don't come to the same life-changing conclusion that we did. Here's Joy Reid.  

Did you hear that? Have you internalized it? Have you brought it deep inside? Let it marinate a little bit. People who don't like Kamala Harris are sexist, obviously, because like Admiral Rachel Levine, she identifies as a woman, too. They're also racist because Kamala Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican college professor. Duh! And by the way, they're also stupid, by definition. They know nothing about civics or American politics. This is the dumbing down of America. Unlike Kamala Harris, you don't ""understand how things work."" 

So, the takeaway is Kamala Harris isn't unpopular because she's a bad person. She's unpopular because you're a bad person. You're the problem. Your racism is hurting Kamala Harris' political career. Damn you bigot! 

And then we realize (How's this for mind-bending?) Joy Reid was talking about us and then we broke down and shed the bitter tears of self-awareness and our journey of education began. We wanted to know more. So, we found an interview that Joy Reid recently did with a Black supremacist website called the Root, a website is now a permanent fixture on our Favorites tab.  

Reid is the child of well-educated African immigrants, grew up in a White neighborhood in Denver and went to Harvard. So naturally, she's got a gut level understanding of the historic Black experience in America, the way you do when you're from Denver went to Harvard. You just feel it, it's just part of you the way it's part of Kamala Harris after growing up in Montreal. , ""Kamala is just a regular sister. In the same way, people would always say that  if your cousin became first lady. Kamala Harris is like, if your cousin became vice president of the United States. I think she doesn't get to show that personality often enough and so people haven't had a chance to know her."" Are you following this?

So, Kamala Harris is like your sister in the same way that Michelle Obama would be like your sister if your sister was your cousin and also married to the president. Why hadn't we realized that before? Well, as Joy Reid pointed out, ""Most of the media is still White and male."" Of course, those damn White males always hiding the sister-cousin connection. It's what they do, but for us, the veil had been lifted. We could see for the first time what our racism had blinded us to for so long, and the truth hurt. It was so painful that for days we had to wear sunglasses, even indoors. But it was worth it because at that point began a journey of contrition and self-discovery that honestly was long overdue.  

, we finally face the truth about ourselves and were moved to weeping by what we saw. How could we be so darn racist? That's the question we're asking ourselves tonight in the fading light of this year's Juneteenth observance. So, that was the old us. We've shed it like a snakeskin. It's time to change. It's time to do better. It's time to think anew tonight about what we thought we knew about Kamala Harris.  

So, we're going to take a look at some of the soundbites we have mocked on this show over the last year and a half and boy, doesn't it feel good just to admit fault, just to say to the world, ""Yes, we're not perfect. We get it wrong sometimes. But not anymore. We have fresh eyes and with those eyes, we're going to assess this footage in a brand new way."" So, here's tape of Harris repeating the very same line about, ""speaking truth."" We used to make fun of this, not anymore.  

So, our assumption really for decades was that politicians who make a habit of using the word truth are probably really by definition, lying. That's why they say truth so often. ""I'm not cheating, I promise."" But what really struck us, the old us, was the fact that Kamala or Kamala, you know, it doesn't matter how you pronounce your name. It just doesn't matter.  

That's the only thing we've realized. She doesn't know how. Neither do we. We'll admit it, but what struck us was that she repeats the same line again and again and again and our old reaction was derision. ""Not exactly Socrates,"" that was the phrase we used, but that reaction we now see comes from a place of privilege. Evaluate your priors, deconstruct your unconscious bias, and ask yourself: would a moron be capable of repeating the same canned phrase dozens of times with this kind of precision, without changing a single facial expression? Oh, no. Try that at home. You can't do it. You're too self-aware. It's impossible for you.

But not for Kamala Harris. She's got what it takes to repeat herself verbatim for days at a time, behaving as if each time is the first time. Oh, We stand corrected, and we stand in awe. Here she was in May telling us about the importance of, and we're quoting, ""working together."" 

So again, we laughed at that clip. We've done it more than once. It feels good to admit it. At the time, we assumed Kamala Harris just got lost in the middle of a sentence. She couldn't find her way out. ""Together, working together... How do we get out of the sentence? Together,"" But now we see what was really happening here. Kamala Harris fully understands the importance of working together, not just working, but together, working together and that's not something we should mock. That's brilliant and science has proven it's brilliant.  

Ten years ago, researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, found, and we're quoting, ""proof that evolution of intelligence and larger brain sizes can be driven by,"" (Do you know what by?) and we're quoting ""cooperation and teamwork."" In other words, working together. So, when Kamala Harris tells us again and again and again that we need to work together, she's not simply repeating some vapid, canned soundbite she's been handed by her handlers. No, she's literally –  – moving human evolution forward.  

She's making the species better on a cellular level. How long until we can fly? If Kamala Harris keeps it up, not long. She does this all the time. She makes us better and as she does, she does her homework. As Joy Reid told us, it's the dumbing down of America. The dummies here can't see it, but Kamala Harris can because she's done the work. Here she was on Monday talking to kids at the National Museum of African American History. 

Okay. So again, there are a couple of different ways to assess that claim. The old us before we were reborn and since we're dealing in clichés now, we're just going to compare ourselves to a phoenix, before we rose from the ashes anew, the old us would have said, ""Wait a second, Kamala Harris, African-Americans weren't actually enslaved for 400 years in this country. That's not true."" But we would have missed the point. 

So, what happened here is that Kamala Harris, before her talk, Googled ""How long was there slavery in America?"" And she saw that it had been 400 years since slavery began in America, which is true, but she forgot to subtract the years since the Emancipation Proclamation. It's actually fewer than 400, about 150 years fewer than 400, which would put us around 250, but whatever. The point is, that's not her fault. It's Google's fault for not doing the subtraction for her. Talk about falling short of the promise of the Internet. Who runs Google? Hmm. Joy Reid anyone? White men.  

So, there's a lot of White supremacy in Palo Alto, California, as Google has already admitted. Not convinced yet? Well, then you're just a bad person and you're also jealous. You know what you're jealous of above all? Not just the brilliance, not just the tenacity. You're jealous of ""Kamala"" or ""Kamala"". Doesn't matter. You're jealous of her joy.  

  

Not just brilliant, but also phenomenal. 

So, ask yourself and be totally honest and put the thesaurus away, how many synonyms could you come up with in a row extemporaneously? Just top your head. Not just brilliant, but phenomenal. Could you do that? Oh, no, you couldn't. And by the way, you don't have her joy. Maybe that's why you don't like her. We don't know. We can only tell you about our journey.

686	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-reacts-roe-wade-protests-coordinated-attack	2022-06-27 22:22:00	Tucker Carlson reacts to Roe v. Wade protests: This is a coordinated attack on the family and on children | Fox News	"WARNING—Graphic footage and language: Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the Supreme Court overturning abortion case Roe v. Wade on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We're coming to you this evening from Rio de Janeiro, which is a huge and beautiful and very complex city on the South American coast. We're going to be here all week. We're filming a documentary for our ""Tucker Carlson Originals"" series on the rise of Chinese power and influence in Brazil. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America by far. It's one of the biggest in the world, and it is the most important ally of the United States in the Western Hemisphere.  

Brazil is a big deal and yet the Biden administration seems determined to hand Brazil over to the sphere of influence of the Chinese Communist Party. Why is that exactly? We hope to find out. We'll also be sitting down for a rare interview with the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, soon. We'll bring that to you when we do. But first, I would like to begin with the loud and at times violent response to the end of Roe v. Wade that came down to the Supreme Court on Friday, as you know. 

If you've been following this, you may have noticed a profound change in the way the Democratic Party talks about the issue of abortion. Gone is the empathy or the room for compromise. So, from the very beginning of this debate 50 years ago, even the staunchest pro-lifer acknowledged the anguish of young women who are pregnant and don't want to be, who were alone and feel trapped by the child growing inside them. And that is the reason that pro-life institutions had built crisis pregnancy centers and to be fair, for generations, even the most committed pro-choicers acknowledge the inherent , which, at the very least, is the end of a potential life. 

""I do not view abortion as a choice,"" said Joe Biden as recently as 2006. ""I think it's always a tragedy."" And of course, it always is a tragedy, even if you believe it should be legal and Democrats once said this out loud forthrightly. In fact, in 1997, as White House counsel, now Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan urged her boss, Bill Clinton, to sign a ban on partial-birth abortions. Elena Kagan has always been pro-choice, but ending the life of a child a week before birth was too much, even for her. And of course, for his part, Bill Clinton never spoke about abortion as anything but as a last resort. He famously described it as something that should be, ""safe, legal and rare."" 

You don't hear that on the left anymore ever. In fact, many on the left now behave as if abortion is itself a positive good, excited by the fact that a child who would have been born wasn't. Think about that for a moment – celebrating the failure of a child to come into the world. What does that say about how you feel about children or about people? In fact, some behave as if having an abortion is preferable to having children.  

How do we know this? Well, no one on the left encourages women to brag about having kids. Having more than a couple of children at most, in fact, it's considered weird and embarrassing, something that Mormons and people who live in the ghetto do. But abortion that's something to tell your friends about. There's even a shout your abortion campaign, highly well-funded, complete with perky T-shirts bragging about ending your pregnancy. What does that say? Nothing good. Over the weekend, you saw a lot of people proudly shouting about their abortions at pro-choice riots all over the country. Here's what Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles looked like. 

What is that? The hysteria is telling. It's not the assault on bodily autonomy of the end of Roe v. Wade. Those are the same people who demanded vaccine mandates, but this happened all over the country. In Arizona, thousands of . On Friday night, they tore down security fencing around the building. They pounded on the Senate's glass doors and windows where the legislature was in session. Police had to fire tear gas from the windows to protect the politicians inside. Here's what the state capital of Arizona looked like on Friday.  

Looks like insurrection to us, but no arrests were made at the Arizona State Capitol on Friday when that footage was shot. There will be no FBI investigation. Democrats who call January 6 the racist insurrection said nothing this weekend about the violent siege of the state capital of Arizona. Did you expect them to? No, of course not and in fact, instead, they justified it.  

Well, you got to give them credit for all being on the same page as usual. We'd love to get the conference code to the morning call where they set that up, but because the court did something they don't like, they're not telling us the third branch of government is ""illegitimate."" The Supreme Court is illegitimate because it's allowing voters to decide what they want to do with abortion. 

Some would call that democracy a system in which citizens choose their own form of government. They're telling us it's illegitimate. On Sunday, the unelected governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, explained that without nine members of the Supreme Court dictating the law for hundreds of millions of Americans, women are fundamentally oppressed. 

Because we're going to get a flood of people. I have declared this as our safe harbor. This is where we have the Statue of Liberty welcoming people who are oppressed, women who cannot receive fundamental right to control their body or receive an abortion. They are oppressed. They're welcome here in the state of New York.  

So, we could go on and on and play you absurd soundbite after absurd soundbite, but what are we seeing here? It's not simply an attack, an explicit attack on the legitimacy of the third branch of government, court. It's not just an attack on the right of people to govern themselves. It's something bigger than that. What you're seeing is a coordinated attack on the family and on children.  

People at these protests are angered at the idea that children are being born. Watch what's happening there. That is hardly an overstatement. Here's a photograph on your screen from this weekend. It was taken outside the Supreme Court. It shows a mother humiliating her children in public, implying they are a burden to her because they are still living. We saw things like this everywhere and pro-abortion protests often in full view of children. This was the scene, for example, in Dallas this weekend. Watch.  

So, what is that exactly? What about the thought of having children makes these people so angry? Where does an attitude like that come from? Well, as it turns out, that attitude comes from the same place the Democratic Party now gets all of its attitudes, directly from corporate America. Corporate America wants you childless and this is a big change. A 100 years ago, big companies built housing for the families of their employees and then schools and libraries to educate them. It was the humane thing to do, but it also seemed to make good business sense at the time. If you wanted workers you could count on, you had to take care of them and their offspring, but over time, that arrangement got expensive.  

Employees with families demanded higher wages to support their children, and in many cases, they formed unions to get those raises. So, labor costs soared. So corporate America, in response to this, developed a new model: hire single women. At many big companies, including in the traditionally male banking sector, young women now make up the majority of new employees and you can see why they do. They work hard, they're reliable. They tend to be loyal to the companies they work for. The one downside to hiring young women is they can get pregnant.  

If you're running the H.R. department at Citibank, that is the last thing you want. Children make your health care plan more expensive. Worse than that, they tend to compete with an employee's attention. Responding to after work emails seems less pressing to most new moms than putting their own kids to bed.  

That's a huge problem for big companies, so they have every incentive to prevent their workers from having children. You can't say that out loud, of course. It would it be too obvious. Give us the best years of your life and in exchange we'll pay you what's effectively a subsistence wage in whatever overpriced urban hellscape we're based in and then take from you the one thing that might give your existence meaning and joy in middle age, which is having children. That's the deal we're offering. That is the deal they're offering, but they can't say that. It would sound like what it is, which is exploitation, no better than what the cotton mills once did to 14-year-old girls.  

So, instead of saying that, which is the truth, corporate America uses the language of the social movement it created, feminism, to spin the entire arrangement as some sort of progressive liberation movement. ""Fight the patriarchy. Have an abortion. It's got nothing to do with lowering our labor costs, we promise."" But of course, it does have everything to do with lowering their labor costs. Across the country they are making that case: abortion as liberation. Many of the biggest American companies are now paying female employees to have abortions, to end their pregnancies. 

That would include Microsoft and Apple, Facebook, Yelp, Netflix, Comcast, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, JP Morgan, Nike, Starbucks, etc. Dick's Sporting Goods is offering female employees up to $4,000 if they get an abortion. Does the company offer the same amount to female employees who want to have children? Well, the editors at Breitbart wondered that. They asked Dick's Sporting Goods that question, but the company didn't even respond and that tells you the answer.  

What's amazing is that in the face of this, so many Americans who ought to know better have fallen for it so some accountant at a soulless, publicly traded corporation concludes that drones with no personal lives make cheaper workers. That's what happened, but rather than question this or resist it, your average college-educated NPR listener nods in vigorous bovine agreement and then becomes completely hysterical when someone suggests that maybe there's another way to live, that it's at least theoretically possible that raising your own children might be more rewarding as a life choice than commuting into a slum on public transportation in order to claw your way up to middle management at Deutsche Bank, but the very thought of that, of turning down Deutsche Bank to bring new life into the world drives these people into a frenzy of rage. 

Choosing a family over service to global capitalism? That's disgusting, shut up. Journalist Drew Hernandez ran into people like this over the weekend. Here's how it went.  

Drew Hernandez shot the footage you just saw. He's an investigative reporter and host of Turning Point USA's Frontlines.

687	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-allowing-brazil-become-a-colony-of-china-significant-blow	2022-06-30 21:51:00	Tucker Carlson: Allowing Brazil to become a colony of China would be a significant blow to us | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson provides insight on the opposition to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here in the United States, we've been so deeply engrossed in our own debates over whether men should be allowed to compete on girls swim teams or whether it's immoral to carry our groceries in plastic bags that we've missed the fact that the government of —taking over the world.  

In the space of just 15 years, for example, the Chinese have succeeded in re-colonizing the entire continent of Africa. Didn't think that could happen? Well, it is happening. In Africa, China now calls the shots and takes the natural resources for itself. Period. As of tonight, there is only one remaining African country that dares to recognize Taiwan, and it happens to be among the smallest countries in Africa, Swaziland. Everyone else on the continent obeys Beijing.

But wait a second. How can this be happening? Isn't colonialism racist and bad? Yes, it is and no one's worse and more racist than the Chinese. Go on Chinese social media sometime and see how they describe the Africans they've subjugated. It's horrifying. So, why isn't the New York Times writing stories about any of this? You know why – because the New York Times is on China's side. That's why they all but ignore the brutal Chinese colonization of Latin America, which is also in full swing right now. 

Colonialism violates everything the New York Times once claimed to believe in, but that's okay, because they never really believed any of it anyway. It was always about power. 

  

 to see for ourselves what the Chinese are doing to Latin America. We're making a documentary about it for our ""Tucker Carlson Originals"" series. Brazil has the last pro-American government in Latin America. It's our single most important ally in the Western Hemisphere. 

Allowing Brazil to become a  would be a significant blow to us and potentially a very serious military threat. The Biden administration appears to be in favor of it. One person who is emphatically not in favor of it is the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. So, of course, the American media hate him. Here's some of their slander. 

These are people whose research consists of 3 minutes on Wikipedia on the way to the studio. ""He's a racist. Of course, he is."" He ""doesn't want lockdowns."" There's your proof. 

But it is the last clip from plagiarist Fareed Zakaria that explains why they're so mad at Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, Fareed Zakaria tells us, represents a ""growing global threat to the ideas of liberalism"" – liberalism, meaning neoliberalism, meaning globalism

 And in fact, that is true. Bolsonaro is no Justin Trudeau. He's not a low-IQ fascist who would be working as an Instagram influencer if he didn't have his own army. He's not the president of Ukraine who shuts down television stations that dare to criticize him and outlaws opposition parties and arms Nazis. 

In conventional terms, Bolsonaro is, in fact, liberal. He has done nothing to stop civil liberties in Brazil. But at the same time, he is a nationalist. He cares about his country. He resists China. Therefore, he must be stopped. George Soros hates him and . He's not with the program. 

So naturally, we wanted to meet him. Yesterday we did. We sat with Bolsonaro for more than an hour and the first thing we learn is that the left  hates him very much. They tried to kill him when he first ran for president four years ago. With very little money in the backing of no party, he came out of nowhere to get 57 million votes. But he almost didn't survive to be elected. 

He was stabbed by a leftist almost to death at a rally, at which point the left funded lawyers to come in and rescue his attempted murderer – an amazing story that hasn't gotten a ton of coverage in the United States. He's an authoritarian, says MSNBC. All right. 

So, we asked Bolsonaro about the stabbing in our conversation, also asked him about his Christian faith, which is on display, something else that triggers them. We asked about our Supreme Court stance on abortion, his views on gun rights, and we asked him fundamentally, why do you think you're so hated?

Amazingly, it was just over a week ago that  gun violence in the United States. How did you miss that? Well, you probably were distracted by all the other amazing things Joe Biden is doing, like making air travel more efficient and winning the war in Ukraine. 

So, you probably weren't paying attention on June 25th when a law called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed and it, true to its name, was, in fact, bipartisan. Fashionably liberal Republicans like John Cornyn helped write it. So, the question is, will it live up to the second half? Will it make communities safer? Emphatically yes, said Joe Biden, ""It's going to save a lot of lives."" How many lives exactly? Well, in the characteristically modest words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, ""What we are doing will save thousands of lives."" Thusands.

And that makes a kind of sense because now that we're going to have red flag laws in all 50 states, laws that allow the government to disarm you by force without charging you with a crime, without bothering with due process. Once we do that, and we are doing it, mass shootings like the one we saw in Buffalo this spring will never happen again. That's what they promised us and the media assured us it was true – every word of it. What they never mentioned was it was not only ridiculous and false, it was provably false because actually gun control does not stop bad people from using guns. It's not a talking point. It's a fact. Here's how you know. 

On the day that 18-year-old Payton Gendron murdered 10 people in Buffalo, the state of New York already had a red flag law and Gendron was exactly the sort of person they told us that red flag laws would stop from committing mass murder. Gendron had bragged in school, remember, that he wanted to murder large groups of people. That was a red flag, speaking of. He'd already been caught by his mother killing a cat with his hands. Gendron was so obviously crazy and threatening that at one point New York State Police came over and investigated him, but in the end, nothing happened. It had no effect, these laws, and that's not surprising. Ask anyone who knows anything about violence and wasn't getting paid to lie to you about it, and you will learn the truth, which is it's almost impossible to stop someone who's dead set on harming other people.  

Prison guards get killed regularly. There are no guns in prison. There are plenty of psychopaths. Psychopaths are the problem. In case you need still more evidence, just yesterday on the 4th of July, there was yet another . Illinois is a state with red flag laws, assault weapons bans, every other form of gun control that authoritarians can dream up in a country that still has the Second Amendment. But the shooting happened anyway. It happened in , which is a pretty suburb north of Chicago and once again, the shooter was exactly the person they claimed red flag laws would stop before he hurt others.  

His name is Robert Crimo. He's a 21-year-old amateur rapper with a long and documented history of bizarre and very threatening behavior. And on Monday, he lived up to what everyone who knew him thought he might someday do. He dressed in women's clothes. He scaled a fire escape ladder to the roof of a local business, and then he opened fire on a parade. 

So awful. As today, the authorities say seven people have died from that shooting. At least 36 others are wounded. Good people, terrified, bleeding, in some cases dead, on the 4th of July. That's awful.

Now a normal person sees a tape like that and takes a breath as the tragedy of it sinks in as it should. Americans were just murdered for no reason. So, pause a beat before politicizing their deaths. Show some respect. You owe them that. But social media do not encourage respect. Social media are the domain of partisans and the first question of partisan asks never changes. It's this: ""How can I use other people's misery to become more powerful myself?"" 

So, on the basis of that, the usual morons leap in to blame the other team. ""They did it. It's their fault. Elect me."" Eric Swalwell did this immediately, of course, speaking of morons, but so did many others. These are the sort of people whose first instinct is to ascribe political or racial motives to every crime, to prove their point about how they were right all along. And sometimes they are right. Sometimes racists and ideologues do commit crimes, but that's not the majority. Some mass killers are White. Some mass killers are Black. Some are right wing. Quite a few are left-wing, actually, though, the New York Times never mentions it. But one thing nearly all mass killers have in common almost every single one of them, with some but few exceptions, all of them are alienated young men. That's the common thread. They're young. They're male. They're crazy. Robert Crimo certainly fit that stereotype. Have you seen the guy's picture? If he sat next to you in the bus, you would move immediately. He literally had face tattoos and dressed in costume in public. 

On his YouTube channel, which for some reason was very quickly scrubbed from the Internet by authorities, (Why is that? We found it.) Crimo posted videos of the presidential motorcade along with newspaper clippings about the Kennedy assassination, speaking of red flags. Months ago, he was filming the Highland Park parade route, the one he shot up. Not surprisingly, in a press conference today, police acknowledged they had encountered Crimo several times before. Three years ago, for example, police arrived after he had attempted to kill himself.  

So, there you have it. Back in April of 2019, police found out that Crimo had tried to kill himself and then a few months later, in September, he threatened to ""kill everyone."" So, police took away his knives and that was it. They didn't follow up and even if they had, what would they have done? Taken away his guns? You get more knives. 

In any case police didn't think the situation warranted further steps. As we saw, Crimo was still able to buy firearms legally despite being obviously mentally ill. Now, pause for a second. Why is that? Look at Robert, Bobby Crimo. Would you sell a gun to that guy? Does he seemed like a nutcase? Of course, he does. So, why didn't anyone raise an alarm?  

Well, maybe because he didn't stand out. Maybe because there are a lot of young men in America who suddenly look and act a lot like this guy. It's not an attack. It's just true. Like Crimo, they inhabit a solitary fantasy world of social media, porn and video games. Their high on government-endorsed weed. ""Smoke some more. It's good for you."" 

They're numbed by the endless psychotropic drugs that are handed out in every school in the country by crackpots posing as counselors and of course, they're angry. They know that their lives will not be better than their parents. They'll be worse. That's all but guaranteed. They know that. They're not that stupid and yet, the authorities in their lives, mostly women, never stops lecturing them about their so-called privilege. You're male. You're privileged. Imagine that. Try to imagine an unhealthier, unhappier life than that. 

So, a lot of young men in America are going nuts. Are you surprised? And by the way, a shockingly large number of them have been prescribed psychotropic drugs by their doctors, SSRI or antidepressants and that would include quite a few mass shooters and keep in mind, again, these drugs are meant to prevent crazy behavior and yet there seems to be a connection.  

Eric Harris, the columbine killer was on Zoloft and Luvox. A year earlier, a 15-year-old called Kip Kinkel shot his parents and dozens of classmates. He was on Prozac. In 2005, a 16-year-old called Jeff Weise killed his grandfather and ten kids in Minnesota. He was on Prozac, too. So was 27-year-old Steven Kazmierczak who murdered six people at Northern Illinois University. In 2012, you may recall when 25-year-old James Holmes walked into a movie theater and shot 82 people. He was on Zoloft.  

The list goes on and on and on and on. It includes the shooter at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013. That would be 34-year-old Aaron Alexis. It also includes Dylan Roof. He's the 21-year-old who shot up the church in Charleston. Now, he was apparently a racist, and we've heard a lot about that. Fine, but we've heard next to nothing about the fact that he was taking SSRIs, he and many, many others. You're not supposed to notice, but some have.  

The Journal of Political Psychology once assembled a list of dozens more mass killings, all committed by young people, young men on prescription drugs. So, is there a connection? Well, we don't know definitively. We do know there are a whole lot more of these drugs being taken by kids than ever before and by the entire population. Who's not taking some prescription medication at this point? Between 1991 and 2018, total SSRI prescriptions in the United States rose by more than 3,000%. 3,000%!

3,000% of anything is a massive change. You don't see changes like that, but the point of this change was to make Americans calmer, saner, happier. Take these drugs and your problems will go away. Yes, you will become numb. You will lose part of yourself. You no longer experience deep joy. You'll become part robot, but at least you won't want to kill yourself or harm other people. That was the promise. 

3,000%. Did it work? Let's see. Over the very same period, the suicide rate in the United States jumped by 35%. Did it work? Well, millions of people got on anti-suicide drugs and we wound up with many more suicides. So, maybe it's not working. Is it possible it's making the problem worse, you think? Well, let's see. Mass shootings also increased dramatically over the very same period. Here's a chart that shows it. Now the halfwits on Twitter always scream the same thing. Correlation is not causation. All right. Whatever that means, but tell us, halfwits. What is going on exactly? What does that chart mean? 

We know that SSRIs are dangerous. It says so right on the label. They increase ""the risk of anxiety, agitation, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity and mania."" Oh, not a big deal. That's not causation. Then what is it? According to one meta study by the FDA, young people who've been prescribed SSRI have an increased rate of suicide. Oh, wait. More suicides? Weren't they supposed to reduce suicide, but we're getting more suicide? Let's stop right there, but we're not stopping. We're accelerating. 

Between 2015 and 2019, the use of SSRI drugs by teens in the United States rose by nearly 40%. So, it's not working? Let's do a whole lot more of it. 

This seems like a massive and extremely obvious problem, extremely obvious. People aren't themselves. They're taking drugs that appear to be causing the behavior that drugs are designed to prevent. Why don't they talk about this on TV? Oh, let's see. In 2020, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than $4.5 billion advertising on national television in this country. Now, how much is that? Well, to put it in some context, Pfizer spent more on advertising in 2020 than it did on research and development.

But it wasn't a bad decision. It was a great decision. Pfizer's revenue doubled last year to more than $81 billion. Now, how do they do that? Well, the ad campaign paid off. It helped convince politicians to require the entire population take Pfizer products, products that don't work as advertised, that have killed large numbers of people and whose side effects are indemnified against lawsuits by the United States Congress. That's quite a business model. You might think it could be a subject of a media story, but no. No stories on Pfizer. They're paid to be fanboys of Pfizer. Therefore, they are.

Here's a tweet, for example, from CNBC, which is ostensibly a news organization and we're quoting, ""Pfizer is uniquely positioned to advance MRNA, which could be a breakthrough for other infectious diseases, genetic diseases and cancer. (Paid post for Pfizer) #ad."" It was on their Twitter account, a news organization. They're admitting it's a paid post for Pfizer. But in CNBC's defense, they're not alone. Pretty much all the news coverage you see in the United States is a paid post for Pfizer. Watch this.  

The Human Factor brought to you by Pfizer.  

CBS Health Watch sponsored by Pfizer.  

And Good Morning America is brought to you by Pfizer.  

Oh, it's all brought to you by Pfizer. Now, why is that? Because TV channels don't prescribe drugs. Doctors do. So, why would Pfizer, a drug company, be advertising on television? Well, we're not sure the answer. Let's put it this way. Don't hold your breath waiting for CNN or Good Morning America to do a hard-hitting investigative piece on the potential connection between prescription drugs and violence. Probably not going to happen since they sponsor those channels. They're going to keep telling you it's all about guns. It's all about guns. 

Does anyone really believe it's all about guns? No one thinks that. If you really thought that guns caused violence, you would, for example, demand far harsher prosecution of gun possession in the cities. That's where most of the shooter’s shootings are taking place, but no one's doing that. Why? Because that's where Democratic voters live. So, there's no chance anyone's going to crack down on them. Instead, politicians are using these tragedies to do what they've always wanted to do, which is disarm their political opponents. Here's someone who's kind of dumb enough to say it out loud. This is the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker. 

Does a single person watching that, does even one person watching that, believe for a second that J.B. Pritzker has had an authentic human emotion in the last 20 years, other than gluttony, greed and the lust for power? No, no one believes that. This is politics. Disarm the law-abiding. That's the first thing every authoritarian regime does, of course. Make sure the other side can't fight back. Of course, that's what they all do. So, of course, in New York, the state's unelected governor, speaking of democracy her name is Kathy Hochul, used to have a little vaccinated necklace, probably won't wear that anymore. But Hochul disapproved a law requiring gun buyers to provide their social media accounts to the government. Hmm. Paging First Amendment lawyers here.  

Applicants must prove to Kathy Hochul satisfaction that they have and we're quoting ""the essential character, temperament and judgment necessary to be entrusted with a weapon."" So, the idea is Kathy Hochul, who has not been elected governor, is the holder of your rights and she kind of doles them out based on your obedience. 

Now, this is an inversion of the basic promise of America, which is your rights came before the government. They were given to you by God – can we use that word now? And the government merely safeguards them, but once you get rid of that, like Joe Biden does, when you start telling us that ""I've thought your rights and if you do what I tell you to do, I'll give them to you,"" there's nothing you can't do. 

So, New York's not stopping there. New York has also made it a felony to carry a firearm in any public place unless your Kathy Hochul's bodyguards. That would include public transit, Times Square. You can't carry a firearm in churches or schools where mass shootings have been known to occur. So, that means the law abiding in New York can't defend themselves. So, is there data on this? Did Kathy Hochul consult some kind of study telling us would save lives? No, not even pretending. Just doing it just because she feels like it. She just admitted that on camera. Watch. 

""Oh, I don't need numbers. I don't need to have the numbers. I'm acting purely on emotion because this is how I feel because I care."" Wow. Living down to the stereotype, anybody? There's no actual evidence that will work. She doesn't need that. She wants more power. Watch Kathy Hochul explain. 

 Imagine you're on a crowded subway and you bang into somebody inadvertently. Tempers flare, and the person that you banged into happens to be carrying a concealed weapon. Imagine you're in a bar. Someone starts a fight. They have a concealed weapon on them. Imagine you're in Times Square visiting with your family. You're on the way to a show with your family and you're surrounded by people with concealed weapons. Does that make you feel more or less safe?  

Where is your vaccinated necklace, Kathy Hochul? Weren't you just bragging about that? You're not bragging about being vaccinated anymore. Why is that exactly? Maybe just come out and explain.

But her reasoning is, as soon as we tell people on the subway, bad people, they can't have guns, they'll immediately obey Kathy Hochul because they voted for her. Oh wait nobody did. Because bad people follow the rules. Is that what she's saying? What is she saying exactly? We're not sure.

Just a quick recap on the never-changing rules of the world. The three things that any functioning country must have an ample supply of are . Those are the fundamental necessities of life— not diversity, equity and inclusion — food, water and energy.  

If you have a surplus of food, water and energy, you win. If you don't, you lose. Now, that may sound unfair, but we did not make the rules. Nature did. We can choose to ignore them, but those rules will never change. Sorry. 

Thankfully for Americans, we live in a country that is remarkably abundant in all three of those things. The U.S. has the most fertile farmland in the world. We've got more potable, fresh water than virtually any other place and critically and rarest of all, America has the largest recoverable oil reserves on the planet. We are number one in that category and that matters maybe more than anything. 

Now, they may be telling you on CNN that so-called renewable energy, windmills and solar panels, are about to power the world. But that's absurd and no one corrects them and somebody should because a lot is at stake. If your nine-year-old starts telling you, ""I'm like Superman,"" you have to correct him before he jumps off the garage. The stakes are high, so it is incumbent on the rest of us to point out the people telling you that have no idea what they're talking about. We are not remotely close to a green energy power grid or anything even approaching it. 

In fact, as of today, the world is powered as it has long been by fossil fuels. Fossil fuels. That's where more than 80% of global energy comes from, not from windmills and solar panels, from oil and gas and coal and that is not going to change soon. In fact, the world's fastest growing economies, that would be India and China, are using more fossil fuels than ever, not less. So, why is every person in charge from the people who make the ads at Nike to the energy secretary, to the , to every anchor on every channel on television telling you exactly the opposite? We'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  

At best, they're ignorant. They're not engineers. They are politicians and ideologues. They're the ones telling you that boys can become girls just by wishing it so, and they've commanded the rest of us to believe that, but unfortunately for them, the principles of social justice do not apply to power grids. You can't just rename them and get something different. No. You have to create new and better power grids and we are nowhere near that and we will not be anywhere near that during the course of our lifetimes. Sorry, that's reality, and you cannot yell loud enough to make it change. For the foreseeable future oil and gas are essential to civilization in an utterly non-negotiable way and that should be great news for America because here in the United States, we have a lot.  

We are rich because we are rich in natural resources. That's why we won the Second World War, for example. When previous generations said, as they often did, that God has blessed our country, this is what they were talking about. Yet suddenly, strangely, the United States is suddenly experiencing shortages of both food and energy and that's why prices of these things have risen, because we don't have enough of them. How did that happen? You should know if you care about the future of America, your children's future, you need to know how this happened. Well, Joe Biden offered his explanation of how it happened today at an event in Ohio. Watch. 

It's just embarrassing. It's grotesque, actually, and at this point is dangerous and no one believes a word of it because it's provably untrue and we feel, since this is a news network, a moral responsibility to prove that it's untrue. So, here we go. Months before the war in Ukraine began and somehow  secretly seized control of gas prices in the United States. How did he do that? Before any of that happened, the magic happened.  

Sober people, a petroleum analysis firm called GasBuddy, decided to do a simple calculation. They wanted to put rising gas prices in context. Here's what they did: math. They determined every year over year price change in gasoline prices in the United States going back to 2002, 20 years, and they found this. From November of 2020 to November of 2021, that would be roughly from Election Day to the end of Joe Biden's first year running the country, gas prices in the United States went up by more than 66%. That was the single highest year-over-year increase since 2002, which happens to be the year the government started tracking those data.  

Now, this happened before Russia invaded Ukraine. Why did it happen? Super simple. Joe Biden on the campaign trail told us he was like Superman, and then he proceeded to jump off the garage. He told us he was going to end fossil fuels and because no one took him seriously, because he's senile and wasn't actually going to win, no one followed up with, ""What, are you insane? How are you going to do that? And so we kept going and then he became president somehow and then he followed through on that promise. 

He canceled pipelines. He terminated oil and gas leases. He rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement without explaining why we should and by the way, if the climate is such a crisis, an existential crisis, and China and India are using more fossil fuels than they did 10 years ago, and nobody says anything about it, maybe they're not really sincere about this global warming thing and then on top of all of that, Joe Biden pumped trillions more dollars into the U.S. economy, thereby devaluing the U.S. dollar and making everything, including energy, more expensive.  

You know what happened. That's all true and it was done on purpose. It was done to change our energy supply from what is cheap, efficient and the source of all of our wealth to something that Biden and his donors control, the green economy that will make us poor and that is, in fact, causing famine around the world right now. So, that's what happened. As a political matter, since this is still sort of a democracy, it happened way too fast and scared the hell out of people and polls showed that. Democrats and Republicans, no matter who they voted for, were worried above all about rising energy prices because it hurt them directly every single day. And by the time Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration had found a scapegoat.  

Maybe that's why they encouraged him to do it in the first place, which they did. So, Joe Biden started yelling, ""It's Putin's price hike. Putin did it!"" But it's so dumb. It's so provably untrue that no one believed it. Even people who wanted to believe it, people who voted for Biden who want windmills and solar farms, they couldn't believe it because it's absurd and in an election year, that's a huge problem. So, the administration had to do something. 

That's why in late March, in an act of desperation, Biden did maybe the worst thing that he has done since becoming president and that's saying a lot. He started to sell off one of this country's most important natural resources, one of our most valuable assets. It's called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the SPR. It's controlled by the Department of Energy. So, what Biden could have done is produce more oil domestically, but that would have been too easy and too good for the United States and its long-term interests. Instead, he decided to do something so crazy and so dangerous that only someone who was intentionally trying to harm the United States would even consider it, but most people never even noticed. Here's his announcement, in case you missed it.  

So, you watch it and you realize really the whole point of the Joe Biden presidency is to humiliate the rest of us and think less of our own country, the place where we were born. You can just imagine Barack Obama and Susan Rice and Ron Klain, people who truly dislike the United States as currently constituted, saying, ""Let's make this guy president. That'll grind it in our face, a guy who can barely talk."" 

So, it's hard to hear anything Joe Biden says because it's hard for him to say anything, but if you listen carefully or read a transcript, you will learn what he just said is we're releasing a million barrels per day for a total of more than 180 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is held in caverns in a couple of states. How much is that? It's a staggering figure. 

So, let's put it in context. The reserve can hold more than 700 million barrels total, but it didn't have that because Congress, by the way, as you haven't been paying attention, has been selling off our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay off debt. So, by the time Joe Biden arrived, there was far less than that. There was about 568 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now, no president in American history has ordered a drawdown this large.  

In 1991, the beginning of Operation Desert Storm, which was an actual war with real American soldiers involved, the U.S. government released 17 million barrels of oil as a way of assuring a stable supply of global crude. The U.S. released just 20 million barrels after Hurricane Katrina destroyed parts of the Gulf Coast where so many refineries are. But now we're releasing many times that figure from the reserve all to protect the Democratic Party from getting what it deserves in the midterm elections in November and as a result of that unbelievably reckless, in fact criminal decision, our oil reserves now at their lowest level in nearly 40 years, and they are dropping fast. None of this needed to happen. There was no reason to tap our Strategic Petroleum Reserve when we could produce the energy here and were in fact producing it until Joe Biden took office.

But at the same time, you have to be honest. Principles of supply and demand would suggest that this would work in the short term. Releasing all this oil should have lowered gas prices until the reserve ran out, which it will. You inject more petroleum into the market and prices for gas should drop, but here's the amazing thing. That's not happening. Since Joe Biden started releasing all this oil from our reserves, which he does not own, you do, we do, what has happened to gas prices? They haven't dropped. They've kept going up. Huh? In mid-June, the price of both regular unleaded and diesel critically hit all-time highs, well over five bucks a gallon nationally. How could this be? It really was a mystery. It violated the most basic rules of economics, but now, thanks to a new report in Reuters, we know why.  

It turns out the oil being released isn't for us. It's going to India and China. According to Reuters, and we're quoting, ""more than 5 million barrels of oil that were part of a historic U.S. emergency reserve released to lower domestic fuel prices were exported to Europe and Asia last month."" The piece continues ""cargo of SPR, crude (oil from our reserves) we're also headed to the Netherlands into a Reliance refinery in India, an industry source said. A third cargo (buckle your seatbelt) headed to China."" To China!  

So, as gas prices set records in this country, as American citizens who were born here and vote and pay taxes cannot afford to fuel their own cars, the Biden administration is selling off our emergency oil reserves to China. That's not an indictable offense? It's certainly an impeachable one and they should impeach him for that. What are they going to sell the Redwood Forest to China next? How about the water rights to the Great Lakes? That's the equivalent of what he just did. 

Now, if you're keeping track, they didn't even need it. China and India already have access to very cheap oil from Russia. Why? Thanks to the Biden administration's lunatic ban on Russian oil imports for moral reasons. It was a moral victory. The people of Ukraine, remember that? Zelenskyy, he was George Washington, said George W Bush who wouldn't know George Washington if he got in the shower with him. 

According to customs data, China spent $19 billion on Russia oil, gas and coal earlier this year. That's double the amount they spent over the same period last year. India spent 5 billion on Russian oil. That's up five times what they spent a year ago. So, we just made Russia a ton of money. What's why the ruble is so strong as the dollar is getting weaker. Russia's raked in $13 billion in additional revenue from India and China compared to the same period last year. Following all this?  

This is how we're punishing our enemies by selling off our own most valuable assets and watching Russia and India and, my God, China get richer? Now, on top of all that cheap Russian oil, China is getting petroleum from our emergency petroleum reserves. The crude, by the way, in the SPR is the best crude we have. It's called medium sour crude. It's the easiest to process, and we're giving it away to a government whose whole goal is to displace us on the global stage and crush us.  

The Chinese will be cruel masters when they run the world. They're not like us at all. By the way, that country, China, also happens to be longtime business partner of the Biden family. Now a functioning Congress would investigate this immediately. The last president was impeached for what? Having a phone call with some corrupt Ukrainian politician. But no, they can't be bothered. They're still yelping about ""January 6 was an insurrection."" They're trying to ban your hunting rifle. So, the White House is able to ignore the whole thing. Here's Joe Biden's glass ceiling-breaking publicist just yesterday.  

How can someone that dumb be that arrogant or is there actually a connection between dumbness and arrogance? Probably so. But if someone asks you in the White House briefing, ""Oh, by the way, is the U.S. government selling our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to our main enemy in the middle of a gas shortage?"" you probably should have an answer, or at least seem embarrassed that you don't. It's a very simple question. Why does customs data show that we are sending millions of barrels of oil to China? Huh? It's been 24 hours since that briefing. We still don't have an answer and of course, that tells you what's really going on here. 

This is not a mistake. It's intentional. As if to make that as obvious as possible, over the weekend, Joe Biden's communications staff tweeted this out under his name: ""My message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices at the pump is simple: this is a time of war and global peril. Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you're paying for the product and do it now."" What is it like nationalizing the gas stations? 

So, he's attacking small businesses in the United States. Running a gas station is not a profitable gig. It's not like running Apple or being a private equity baron or doing any of the things that Joe Biden's donors do. It's not like being Nancy Pelosi who somehow got super rich. How did that happen? No, it's a small business. So, he's blaming them as he sells our national assets to our enemies. So, no one with a basic understanding of economics can pretend to justify what that tweet says. It's just too stupid. Even CNN wouldn't swallow it. Watch.  

Well, exactly and that's literally true. They make more than a Snickers bar on a percentage basis than they do from a gallon of diesel fuel, but we may be blaming the wrong people here. Karine Jean-Pierre, please. She has no idea what's actually going on. She just reads from the binder, barely read whatever. They have to workshop sound bites like ""Putin's price hike."" All right.  

They're not making any decisions. The people who are making decisions are former Obama staffers like Brian Deese. He runs the National Economic Council. He's Joe Biden's top economic adviser. You can thank him. We should put his picture on the screen more often. On Thursday, he told us accidentally, maybe what's actually going on, why the Biden administration is deliberately sabotaging the United States by crushing our energy supply for the benefit of China. Watch this.  

Yeah. We've got to stand firm. The liberal world order. How's that working for you, by the way? Is there anybody who is happier because of it except for people like that? No. But they don't care because you will own nothing and be happy. What they didn't tell you was that China will own everything, including our oil supply. Wait till they come from the Great Lakes.

Good evening and welcome to ""."" Here's a story that tells you a lot. Last Friday, a 35-year-old convicted felon called Austin Simon walked into a neighborhood convenience store in Harlem in New York City and pushed his way behind the counter. Austin's girlfriend had just had a dispute with the clerk in the store. The clerk was a 61-year-old Dominican immigrant called Jose Alba.  

The woman wanted a bag of potato chips, but there was no money left on her government issued food stamp card, so the clerk tried to take back the chips. The woman became enraged and went and got her boyfriend. Now, the boyfriend, Austin Simon, had a long history of violent crime. Simon has spent at least three years in prison for assault. His most recent parole expired last May.  

Though Simon had no apparent job, he was wearing a $300 designer T-shirt and a gold earring, and he was extremely angry. He was furious. Austin Simon threw Alba into a wall, then leaned down and screamed in his face. When the older man stood up, Simon grabbed him by the neck. Here's a local news account describing what happened next.  

Alba was 61, by the way, he's every bit as old as he looks. Now Simon died. Every death is sad, but at the same time, decent people can acknowledge that some deaths are much sadder than others and Austin Simon's death is not one of those. Simon was a thug. He was a taker. He was a cruel and vicious bully. Austin Simon was the sort of person who beats up old men simply because he can. Functional societies have zero tolerance for people like Austin Simon because people like Austin Simon hurt the weak and prevent the productive from producing.  

They themselves contribute nothing. They are, in fact, the mirror image of men like Jose Alba. Jose Alba came to the United States 30 years ago to work, and working is exactly what he was doing at the bodega in Harlem and almost midnight on Friday, selling chips to people who don't bother to work, holding up the retail economy for minimum wage. A healthy society celebrates, venerates men like Jose Alba, men with jobs and families, men with independence and dignity and above all, a healthy society affirms the right of men like this to self-defense.  

Self-defense is the cornerstone of all liberty. If you can't defend your own life and property, you have no rights at all. That was obvious in America for centuries. This was a country whose leaders encouraged decent behavior, who held up the common man as a hero, but that has changed. Jose Alba wasn't lauded for his bravery or his resourcefulness. He wasn't congratulated for defending himself in the face of a violent felon much younger than him. Though every single normal person who watched that video on social media applauded, every single one, and yet Alba was arrested at the scene and he was sent to jail. 

An openly racist Soros-backed prosecutor called Alvin Bragg, then charged Jose Alba with felony murder. He sent to Rikers Island, a jail famous among Democrats because it's so squalid and so dangerous that they have spent decades trying to shut it down, but it wasn't so bad they didn't send Jose Alba there and then Bragg set his bail at a quarter of $1,000,000—$250,000 in a city that very recently was considering getting rid of all bail.  

Compare that to the bail of other violent criminals. Now, a judge later lowered that bond to $50,000, but the message that Bragg sent was very clear to everyone watching and it was this: If the criminal who assaults you is a member of a favored group, you don't have the right to fight back. You may not defend yourself. You must take whatever he gives you because thugs have more rights than you do, you being the person dumb enough to be working in almost midnight in a bodega in Harlem on a Friday. That's the message and it wasn't simply Alvin Bragg who was sending it.  

The tech companies, as always, joined with government as a unified force to send this message. GoFundMe deleted Jose Alba's fundraising page from the Internet. Contrast this with how the left's militia are treated. Now, GoFundMe explained we don't allow fundraising for anyone who's been charged with a violent crime. Really? Well, that's just a lie and provably so. BLM rioters were encouraged to raise money for bail and their legal defense. They can have lawyers, but not bodega clerks. They are powerless and they must remain so. So, GoFundMe openly encouraged rioting in the name of George Floyd on behalf, in effect, of Joe Biden two years ago, but Jose Alba, they shut his family down in hours.  

So, who made this decision specifically? We should know their names. GoFundMe is a company. Here's who runs it. Tim Cadogan is the CEO of GoFundMe. Juan Benitez is the president. You're seeing their pictures right there. The chief corporate affairs officer at GoFundMe is called Margaret Richardson. These are the people who made this decision to crush Jose Alba and his family, but they're not the only ones. Virtually every power center in the United States agrees that self-defense is no longer allowed. You can no longer fight back and if you don't believe it, remember how the media covered the Rittenhouse trial. 

""He carried a gun across state lines. He's a White supremacist."" Here was a man exercising his lawful, his fundamental right of self-defense, but he was charged with murder and corporate media backed the prosecutors. During Rittenhouse's trial, one prosecutor called James Kraus told the jury openly that Rittenhouse should have just allowed the thugs to beat him to death.  

He had no right to defend himself, ""Everyone takes a beating sometimes,"" Kraus says, a man who's never taken a beating in his life, and then another prosecutorial call called Thomas Binger, declared that if you own a gun, you are effectively waiving your right to defend yourself. Watch. 

So, there's the closing arguments in Wisconsin during the Rittenhouse trial. You lose the right to self-defense when you're the one who brought the gun. Now, legally, that is nonsense. It's insane. There's no reference point whatsoever in American law for that statement, but the law is not the point. 

They don't need the law. They now have the unilateral authority to destroy your business, ruin your reputation, throw you in prison, prevent your family from hiring a lawyer to defend you or get you out of jail.  

You saw that happen in St Louis when another Soros-backed D.A., this one called Kim Gardner, targeted the McCloskey family. Now the McCloskeys were sitting having dinner outside their house bothering nobody in Saint Louis when a mob out of nowhere came to the gate, broke the gate, stormed their property and threatened them.  

So, they went inside and got their legally retained firearms and displayed them. They didn't shoot anybody. It was their property. They held up their guns and said, ""Get off our land, stop threatening us."" What did these Soros-backed prosecutor do? Charge the McCloskeys with felonies.  

Another Soros-backed prosecutor. Now you have to wonder, why would a Hungarian currency trader be interested in spending untold millions and millions and millions of dollars to invert our justice system, to put the state on the side of the lawless, to put prosecutors on the side of the criminal against the law abiding?  

What source is interested in doing that? It's clearly working and what gives him the right to change our ancient justice system? None of the media asked that question. Instead, they celebrated the days that he installed. Kim Gardner was celebrated by the news media. As CBS 60 Minutes reporting gleefully Gardner, ""stopped locking up nonviolent offenders, dropped low level drug cases and ended cash bail."" Right.  

What 60 Minutes didn't tell you is that under Gardner's tenure, the city recorded its highest per capita murder rate in over half a century. Many more people died. Died. And not just in Saint Louis and not just in New York and not just in Baltimore, Philadelphia, everywhere. Arlington, Virginia, experiencing a significant increase in violent crime this year.  

Why? A Soros-backed prosecutor called Parisa Dehghani-Tafti has also prosecuted clear cases of self-defense. You can't defend yourself. The people who are favored by the regime can do whatever they want. You can do nothing to protect your life, your family, your property. 

Burglars broke into the Arlington Smoke Shop in March of 2020, middle of the night. A store employee who was sleeping in the store because there were so many break ins shot at the robbers, as is his right, in fact his duty and he should be applauded for that, but no, he was prosecuted. We spoke to the store owner about what happened. 

  

So, at this very moment, the Biden administration is letting in millions, literally millions of illegal aliens, foreign nationals whose identities we can't actually know because they work hard, the American Dream, the Statue of Liberty. Give us your tired, huddled masses, etc., etc.. Okay, but then when those immigrants come here and work in a bodega in Harlem or a smoke shop in Arlington and they're faced with violent crime, this same party, the Democratic Party, punishes them for defending themselves.  

Whose side are they on exactly? Now, in the Arlington smoke shop case, that prosecution resulted ultimately in an acquittal. Thank God, but what about the employee who was in prison? He spent months in jail. His life was destroyed. Again, the point of this is not just to hurt him, but to send a message to the rest of us. Whether you're in Arlington or Kenosha or Saint Louis or New York City, you do not have the right to self-defense in the United States. This is national policy and Joe Biden has effectively articulated it.  

You might remember he delivered his big anti-gun speech shortly after he took office, the one where he declared the Second Amendment isn't ""absolute."" He'll decide what your rights are. Biden did not even mention self-defense a single time and that's because Democrats don't believe it is a right. They've said as much. Here's Claire McCaskill. Some kind of washed up Democratic politician, one of the dumbest senators ever to serve in the body from Missouri, explain on MSNBC why people don't actually need ammunition to shoot at home invaders.  

Claire McCaskill will decide how you defend yourself. You don't need seven. How many do we need, Claire McCaskill? Do you know anything at all about anything? Give us a list of the things you know. That would not include anything about firearms. So-called high-capacity magazines don't have 70 rounds and they don't have half of 70 rounds. No one in the Democratic Party knows what a round is anyway. Here's Dick Durbin claiming that people are walking around with clips with multiple pieces of ammunition. Watch the ignorance on display.  

They haven't learned. They've been talking about guns for 50 years. They haven't learned a single thing about guns. Why? Because they don't care about guns because it's not actually about guns. It's about power. They make the society far more dangerous than it was three years ago.  

They make it far more chaotic than it has ever been in its history. It's their voters doing this and then they tell you there's nothing you can do about it. You can't even defend your own life or the life of your family. That's what they're saying. That's not a reassuring message. It's really ominous.

691	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-no-group-benefited-more-covid-communist-china	2022-07-08 22:44:00	Tucker Carlson: No group benefited more from COVID than Communist China | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson argues no one benefited more from the COVID pandemic than China on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

A look back for a moment, the  that would be the virus itself, and our government's response to it turns out to have been the single most destructive event to take place in the United States in our lifetime – so destructive that it's going to be many years before we know for certain what the last two and a half years have caused to all of us. But even now, the outlines of it are clear.  

COVID crashed our economy first and foremost. GDP fell by the biggest percentage since the Great Depression; 22 million Americans lost their jobs in the first two months of the lockdowns. Remember that? What you may not know is that at least 5 million of them never went back to work. They dropped out of the workforce, apparently for good. At the same time, as fewer people were working thanks to the profligate lunacy of our leaders, our national debt rose by nearly $10 trillion, unprecedented, and along with the debt, our debt to China also rose and then at the level of our society, every bad thing became more common: drug ODs, suicide, illiteracy, crime, all of them skyrocketed. So did obesity, anxiety and alcoholism has been virtually every other marker of social decay.  

Marriages and birth rates, meanwhile, dropped, so did church attendance. We could go on, but you know what happened because you live here. And none of that is even counting the deaths from the coronavirus itself. That's a topic that public health authorities have lied about so consistently that we will likely never know what the real number is, but we can be confident the toll was in the hundreds of thousands.  

So, on every level, COVID crushed America. Centuries-old traditions just evaporated. It's a different country, and not a better one. But that doesn't mean that everybody suffered under COVID. Countless small businesses went under. That devastated our middle class, but at the same time, thanks to the lockdowns, the tech monopolies thrived. Apple, Google, Amazon all saw their market caps explode. Jeff Bezos wound up much richer than ever before, not that he needed the money. But no group benefited more from the COVID pandemic than the leaders of communist China.  

By April of 2021, that would be more than a year into COVID when we are suffering, here in China, the GDP had reached the highest level ever recorded. China's economy was growing faster after the pandemic than it had been before the pandemic and as a result of that, China will soon overtake the United States as the world's dominant economy soon. Now, if someone had predicted that you ten years ago, you would have laughed. It would have seemed ridiculous, but that was before COVID. Now it's real and COVID made it possible.  

In other words, the  didn't simply change the United States. The coronavirus changed the balance of power in the world forever. So, when you think of COVID that way, and that's the way the people who run governments think about it, trust us, when you think of it that way, it becomes pretty obvious that this was more than an overhyped public health emergency. In fact, it may very well have been a crime, the greatest crime in history. Was it? It's hard to think of a more important question, and yet our leaders seem curiously uninterested in answering it.  

Shortly after Joe Biden took office, he ordered the intel agencies to determine where COVID came from and the report he got back stunned him. It was inconclusive. There are two theories, of course. One is that COVID came from a lab leak in Wuhan. The other was it came from a pangolin or some kind of animal. Here's what the Intel agency said. ""The majority of elements within the Intel community do not believe there's sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other."" 

That may seem like not a big deal to you, but if you're the Democratic Party, if you spent a year dismissing any talk of a lab leak as a racist conspiracy theory, this was stunning because it suggested that actually the CIA thought it was entirely possible that the Chinese government manufactured coronavirus. So, in May of last year, Joe Biden publicly, very publicly, sent that report back to the intel agencies and told them to, ""redouble their efforts to find out where COVID came from,"" and he gave them a deadline of 90 days. In August, the report arrived. It was just a page and a half long, but it was more conclusive: ""one IC element assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with the SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory associated incident probably involving experimentation, animal handling or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" 

Now, that should have been a running headline for months after. It wasn't. It almost immediately disappeared, but think about what they're saying. A lot of people in the intel community believe this came from a lab, not on talk radio, people who work at the CIA. And there are a lot of reasons to think they're right. 

State Department officials had visited that lab in Wuhan back in 2018, and according to The Washington Post, ""they sent two official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab, which was conducting risky studies on coronavirus from bats."" Then it turns out one of the biggest funders of the Wuhan lab, a man called Peter Daszak, who received millions in grants from Tony Fauci, boasted about manipulating  right before the pandemic began. Remember this?  

That's an incredibly incriminating piece of tape and yet that man, Peter Daszak, has not been hauled before a congressional committee. Has the CIA spoken to him? There's no evidence that they have. It looks to be that the experiments he was conducting, in part with American tax dollars, may have led to the destruction of the U.S. economy and millions of deaths.  

The Times of London reported that a virus 96% identical to the Wuhan coronavirus had been found in an abandoned copper mine in China in 2012. That virus was collected in 2013 and then stored and studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And then on this show, we spoke to a Chinese virologist who says she was at the scene who said that COVID originated from a lab experiment. All of this was taking place in public. Our intel agencies could not deny it, but in their report, they gave Joe Biden an out.  

In the report that was not even two pages long, they said that in order to reach a definitive conclusion about where the virus came from, we would need the help from the government of China. And of course, the intel agencies knew we would never get that help. ""China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19.""  

So, if you're the Biden administration, and you really wanted to know where COVID came from, that line would justify putting immense pressure on the government of China to hand over the answers so we could find out what the hell just happened, but Joe Biden didn't do that. A few months after the Intel Community second report came out, a reporter asked Joe Biden,"" Why haven't you followed up on the recommendation and pressured the government of China to answer basic questions about where COVID came from?"" And you may remember this, or maybe you've never seen it before. Here's Biden's response. He just smiled and walked away. 

He just smiled and walked away and no one followed up. There was no outrage in the United States Congress. No one in the media yelled at him for that. It was clear that Joe Biden had zero interest in finding out where the virus came from and whether or not China was involved now. Why is that? Well, the Chinese government has made Joe Biden's family extraordinarily rich, richer than we knew. In fact, we learned from the Washington Free Beacon that the Biden administration has sent a million barrels of oil from our, not belonging to him, but to us, the American people, our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a Chinese owned energy company that Hunter Biden has invested in. 

Remember they used to tell you that the Trump kids were so corrupt? All of them got poorer after four years of the Trump administration. But not Joe Biden's son. But it's not just Biden and his administration that has ignored China's potential involvement in creating COVID. The media are not interested either. Why is that? Well, keep in mind, the government of China pays American media a lot of money in an exchange, why not ignore what could be the crime of the century? In recent years, China has spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising in American newspapers. That would include The New York Times and maybe that's why the New York Times' COVID reporter Apoorva Mandavilli sent out this tweet last year, ""Someday we will stop talking about the lab leak theory and maybe even admit its racist roots. But alas, that date is not yet here."" 

So, it was racist to ask whether the outbreak of a global pandemic in Wuhan might be related to the Chinese government lab in Wuhan that was experimenting on a version of the same virus. Yeah, that was racist, but the entire media took that posture throughout the pandemic. Note that it's a foreign virus, which it is, and you're a racist. 

These people, they're stupid and they're dishonest, but it's more than that. Where did this talking point come from? It's racist to point out that COVID came from China. Well, this talking point became prevalent in March of 2020 and it just so happens that's exactly when China's state-owned media tweeted that terms like Wuhan coronavirus were racist. Before China's government issued that order, our media here in the United States didn't recognize the term Wuhan coronavirus as a slur. In fact, they themselves said it constantly. Here's the proof.  

Those clips are all from February of 2020. Chinese media tells them that the term Chinese coronavirus, Wuhan coronavirus, those are racist terms. So, the American media immediately declares that those are racist terms. They're taking their orders directly from Chinese state media. Are you surprised? They aren't we interested in finding out where the COVID virus came from, but we're interested in the topic, and it turns out there's a lot of very interesting information that the intel community somehow left out of its page and a half long report.  

We're going to start in May of 2021. That's when Joe Biden ordered the intel community to assess this, but we're going to include information that they left out. Here it is. On May 5 of 2021, a former New York Times science reporter called Nicholas Wade wrote in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists a review of something called the ""furin cleavage site"" of the virus. That's something that increases the viral infectivity of human cells. His analysis included this quote from David Baltimore who is a virologist and former president of the California Institute of Technology ""When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence with its, arginine codons, I said to my wife, it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARs2."" 

In other words, when I look carefully at the virus, I realized it was manmade and then later in May, 18 prominent scientists published a letter in the journal Science saying a new investigation was needed because ""theories of accidental release from the lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.""  

Keep in mind, this is how scientists write, but the headline is actually the lab leak theory might not be a theory. Now, among the people who signed that letter was Ralph Baric. He's a virologist in the United States who works closely with Shi Zhengli. That's the infamous ""bat lady"" from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If Ralph Baric's name seems familiar to you, it's because that name was in many internal emails that we now have seen from inside the National Institutes of Health. Those emails came out in June of 2021 and in those emails, we learn that in the earliest days of the pandemic, researchers warned Tony Fauci that the virus appeared to come from the lab, that it wasn't natural, it was manmade.  

Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California, wrote this: ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (< 0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features potentially look engineered."" 

It's just the very beginning. People who are looking through microscopes at the virus said to themselves, ""Wait a second. Someone made this."" The emails also show that Tony Fauci demanded information for a gain-of-function experiments from subordinates, particularly gain-of-function experiments in Wuhan. Fauci then sent an urgent email to his deputy, a man called Hugh Auchincloss. The subject of that email is in all caps and it was: ""IMPORTANT"" quote ""Hugh, it is essential that we speak this a.m. Keep your cell phone on. Read this paper as well as the email that I will forward. You will have tasks today that must be done."" 

Fauci then attached to document the email mail titled ""Baric, Shi, et all- Nature Medicine- SARS Gain and function.pdf."" 

Now, keep in mind that Tony Fauci denied under oath that Ralph Baric, a researcher in the United States, had ever conducted gain-of-function research in Wuhan and yet here was Tony Fauci emailing his subordinates about Ralph Baric’s work with Wuhan's bat lady, who was the person conducting infamous experiments on bat coronaviruses that may have changed the global order, that may have caused this pandemic and put China ahead of the United States and therefore in charge of the world 

Now, around the same time, the emails show the director of the NIH, the now completely discredited Francis Collins, was trying to bury the lab leak theory. Collins wanted his underlings to find, ""something NIH can do to help put down this very destructive conspiracy."" Now, keep in mind, Francis Collins at the very same time was running around telling everyone what a great Christian he was and doing all these interviews with the evangelical websites, telling people to listen to what Tony Fauci was saying, believe the U.S. government.  

""No, the lab leak theory is ridiculous. Get the vax."" That was Francis Collins. 

Well, it turns out he was lying, but none of this made it into the Intel agency's one-and-a-half-page report to Joe Biden. Neither did the news that the Wuhan lab spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new filtration system shortly after the pandemic began. Really? On September 16, 2019, nearly three months after the first reported cases of COVID-19 emerged, the Wuhan lab agreed to spend $606 million on a ""central air conditioning renovation project."" $606 million. That's a lot for HVAC.  

So, in the face of all of this evidence, which at this point is overwhelming, the World Health Organization, of all places, is demanding a new investigation into the origins of COVID. Keep in mind, W.H.O. rigged the last investigation by making Peter Daszak the sole U.S. investigator, but officials in this country, for reasons we can't understand, are still resisting efforts to find out what was happening at the Wuhan lab with, by the way, the support of U.S. taxpayer.  

Now, what's the Wuhan lab up to now? Well, it may come as a surprise to you that at the Wuhan lab, they're now working on monkey pox viruses. In fact, they're more than working on monkey pox viruses. They're assembling new monkey pox viruses. According to one study underway at this moment, ""since MPXV infection"" (what would be monkey pox) ""has never been associated with an outbreak in China, the viral genomic material required for qPCR detection is unavailable,"" and therefore the lab has to engage in ""viral DNA recombination's"" creating a fragment of the virus from the ground up, which they call a ""fail safe."" 

In other words, Frankenstein c--- with monkey pox. Amazing. In the face of all of this, the White House has buried any real investigation into the origins of COVID and so this research is allowed to continue, research that could make COVID look like nothing. 

No one's saying anything about this. So, tonight we want to talk to someone who has not been in lock step, someone who from the very beginning has been brave enough to point to the most obvious origin of COVID and that would be the lab in Wuhan and that man's name is Steven Mosher. We first talked to him in February of 2020.  

Steven Mosher was the first person we heard say that. Very few honest people would disagree at this point.

We told you about this on Friday night and then over the weekend, we put it into some context. So, we will summarize the story for you once more. Last summer, a group of American intelligence analysts working for the U.S. government issued a report on the . They've been asked to and they did. These people work at CIA, NSA, a bunch of other agencies, and they concluded that the coronavirus may very well have been manufactured in a lab by the Chinese military. 

Turns out, that's not a talk radio conspiracy theory. As a factual matter, it's a very real possibility, and if it's true, if that's what happened and again, many highly informed people believe that's exactly what happened, that would mean the Chinese government is responsible for killing millions of people around the world and would also raise questions, obvious questions about motive. Why would China unleash a deadly virus on the globe? To the American mind, that is an unimaginable thing to do, but the Chinese government thinks very differently from the way that we think, and here's why.  

America has been the dominant power in the world for more than 100 years, since the end of the First World War, when Europe destroyed itself. Empires destroying themselves always pave way for new empires, something we should keep in mind at the moment. So, American attitudes about everything are shaped by generations of casual affluence. We're in charge and we always will be in charge. That's what all of us assume. But the Chinese government does not assume this about us or them.  

Until fairly recently, China was a poor country. There are still millions of living Chinese who remember seeing their neighbors starve to death during famines. As a result of that experience, China is very aggressive and very ambitious in ways that your average State Department official from Bethesda could not begin to comprehend. So, would a government like that use COVID as a bioweapon? Well, why wouldn't it?  

The coronavirus reshuffled the global order. It crushed the American economy. It made China preeminent. If China takes over the world and that appears to be coming, COVID will be one of the main reasons it was able to. So, by definition, you would think we would want to know where COVID came from. That's a meaningful question, but Joe Biden doesn't want to know. He ignored the report he ordered. He ignored the findings of his own intelligence agencies. That's bizarre when you think about it and if you think that's weird, how about this?  

This February, Biden canceled a counter-espionage program called the China Initiative. Now, the point of that program was stopping the rampant threat of our national security secrets by the government of China. But the White House decided to very little fanfare that somehow that program was racist and therefore it had to end. That means the Chinese government can now spy and steal with impunity. Not since Franklin Roosevelt colluded with Joseph Stalin has an American president done anything like that, but Joe Biden didn't hesitate. And then he kept doing things like this. Now, Biden says he plans to end tariffs against China, tariffs that Donald Trump put in place and that China has been complaining about ever since. And not only is Joe Biden ending tariffs against China, Joe Biden's Justice Department has just arrested the man responsible for those tariffs. His name is Peter Navarro.  

He was the most effective China hawk in the Trump administration. Last month, Peter Navarro was handcuffed at a Washington, D.C. airport and dragged to jail in leg irons. Why? Supposedly because of January 6, but Peter Navarro had literally nothing to do with January 6. He wasn't even there, but Joe Biden didn't stop there. Steve Bannon was the other notable voice in the Trump administration, warning about the growing power and malicious intent of the Chinese government. In November of last year, Steve Bannon was also arrested by the Biden Justice Department, also on absurd pretexts. So, take a step back. What's the message here? Well, it's unmistakable. Don't criticize the Chinese government, or we will throw you in jail. 

Now, if you happen to be watching all this from Beijing, as Chinese leaders definitely have been, you would be applauding. Joe Biden just arrested your loudest critics. How gratifying is that? Things are going well for you. You already control Canada, whose brain dead, prime minister is effectively a Chinese lackey. Now the most powerful country in the world is doing exactly what you want it to do. You'd be thrilled by this. You'd be especially thrilled to see Joe Biden destroy America's single greatest asset, which is its domestic energy supply, and make the United States entirely dependent on Chinese technology for wind and solar projects. If you're the Chinese government, this is the masterstroke. This is the checkmate. Once you control a country's energy grid, you control that country. And you would know that because you didn't go to Yale Law School and you know something about reality as a result and by the way, if you're watching all this from Beijing, you would find it especially amusing to have the president of the United States sell you his country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even as he declared oil and gas off-limits to his own population.  

If you could pull that off, you would know you were entirely in charge of the U.S. government. You could make Joe Biden do anything, but of course you already knew that because you've seen it in action. When American forces left Afghanistan, Joe Biden turned over Afghanistan's entire mineral wealth, which is vast, to the Chinese government. That would include gold and coal and oil and gas, lithium, rare earth minerals, resources the United States needs to make smartphones, automobiles, power our energy grid. But Joe Biden handed all of that to the government of China, and then he kept going.  

Biden also dropped the Trump administration's efforts to ban Chinese surveillance programs that poses social media apps. That means WeChat and TikTok. Then Biden approved licenses for Huawei, which is controlled by the Chinese government, to buy auto chips. That gives the Chinese government even deeper control over the automotive supply chain in this country, one of our last manufacturing sectors. And then as a humiliating flourish, a deep and groveling kowtow, Joe Biden signed a so-called climate pledge with China.  

China will ignore this pledge, obviously, they already are ignoring it, but we will take the pledge seriously because that's the kind of country we are and that pledge will further cripple our domestic energy production because that's what it was designed to do. It's all pretty amazing when you think about it, when you put it in context. Whatever helps the Chinese government, Joe Biden has dutifully done. Whatever hurts America's most important strategic interests, he has also done. But why is he done this? How did the Chinese government wind up with so much control over the United States president, over Joe Biden's behavior?  

We've been mulling that for more than a year and that's why since October of 2020, we have been on the  because that seems like the key to this question: how the Chinese government got so much control over Joe Biden. Now the tech companies have tried to censor that story at every turn. They're doing so again tonight and it's not surprising why. They're beholden to China as well, but we've continued to pull those threads; so has the Daily Mail.  

In April, the Daily Mail reported that a whistleblower was in possession of 450 gigabytes of deleted material from . The whistleblower's name is Jack Maxey. He'd gone to Switzerland, fearing retaliation. We wanted to know more so in April, we flew to Zurich to meet Jack Maxey. Here's part of what he told us. 

So, you can say what you want about Jack Maxey and you can dismiss him by calling him names. But the story he was telling was really interesting, tantalizing in fact, given what we already knew was on the laptop, but for some reason, no one in law enforcement appeared to be listening or even care. But the Daily Mail kept going on this. Recently, they said they gained access to a backup of Hunter Biden's iPhone from the laptop and it's a good thing they did. It turned out to be a trove of fascinating information. It included a voicemail from Joe Biden to his son talking about a story in The New York Times about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China. Here's part of it.  

So, the context for that is complicated. Here's what's not complicated: Joe Biden has said on the record repeatedly that he had no knowledge of his son's business dealings with China. That proves Joe Biden was lying, and we have a lot more on this coming up, but just know that. That voicemail, which apparently is real, proves that Joe Biden knew about his son's business dealings with China. That ought to be enough to spur a wave of media inquiries to the White House. Why didn't you lie to us? You haven't seen that.  

Now, the Times piece you just heard Joe Biden reference was published on December 12th, 2018. The story reported on Hunter's dealings with a man called Ye Jianming. He led the CEFC China Energy Company until 2018. At that point, he was arrested on charges of corruption and economic crimes by the Chinese government, which is never a good thing. He hasn't been seen since. The government of China has seized most of CEFC's assets. One of his top deputies called Patrick Ho, was also convicted in New York, of bribing African officials to help Iran avoid oil sanctions. What a group. These are Hunter Biden's business friends.  

Why would Joe Biden have any interest in this? Why would he be concerned about a New York Times story on CEFC and Hunter Biden? Well, it could be for the obvious reason. Joe Biden himself was making money from this, from CEFC, lots of money. According to emails obtained by the New York Post from Hunter Biden's laptop in October of 2020, one of Hunter Biden's business partners, James Gilliar explained that Joe Biden would receive a 10% stake in CEFC.  

""The equity will be distributed as follows,"" he wrote, 20 to Hunter, 20 to Rob Walker, 20 to Gilliar himself, 20 to Tony Bobulinski, 10 to Jimmy Biden, that would be the president's brother, and ""10% held for the big guy."" The big guy. So, Tony Bobulinski, whom we interviewed for a full hour, he got a 20% stake of this deal, told us that there was ""no question"" the big guy is who he so obviously is. That would be Joe Biden. This arrangement meant millions of Chinese dollars for Hunter and Joe Biden.  

In early 2017, just a few weeks after Biden left the White House, the first time a company controlled by Ye called State Energy HK sent $6 million in wire transfers to Robinson Walker LLC. Robinson Walker LLC was controlled by Rob Walker, one of Hunter Biden's business partners. Then in June of 2017, Hunter Biden emailed Ye demanding $10 million more as seed money for a new company called SinoHawk Holdings.  

In August 2017, another Hunter Biden controlled company called Hudson West received a $5 million wire from CEFC. CEFC also paid Hunter Biden's law firm, Owasco, nearly $5 million. These are according to bank records reviewed by Senate investigators and if we just pause here for a moment. In their details, these stories bear a striking resemblance to the Russiagate insanity that we were dragged through for years. Remember, they go on TV and bore you for an hour with how all these things fit together and then this money went that way, but in the end, there was nothing there. 

Operating on the theory, which isn't really a theory, it's true that they always accuse you of exactly what they themselves are doing. It's kind of striking that the truth about what the Biden family, the president, his son and his brother Jimmy, it's almost exactly what they accused the Trumps of doing, except in the case the Bidens, they really were getting rich from a foreign power that means us harm and it's not Russia which is globally almost irrelevant. It's China, which is now preeminent.  

So, to continue with the details, Owasco, in turn, sent the $1.4 million to Lion Hall Consulting. That was a consulting firm run by Jimmy Biden, the former nightclub owner, the president's brother and his wife, and that was just the beginning of the arrangement. Emails unearthed by the New York Post found that someone called the chairman, that would be Ye, promised to pay Hunter Biden $10 million a year, and we're quoting, ""introductions alone."" 

In other words, leveraging his father's position in government to get rich. That's illegal, right? It's also a violation of the Fara Act, which the Biden administration has been enforcing against its political enemies. So, Hunter Biden wrote to a CEFC official that Ye had amended the deal to provide for ""a much more lasting and lucrative arrangement."" These payments continued even after CEFC's leaders were arrested on corruption charges. Hunter was paid another $1 million to represent Ye's deputy, Patrick Ho even though he had no criminal defense experience because he was a lawyer, because he went to Yale Law School, because he's a genius, the one that your kids can't get into because they're not as smart as Hunter Biden.  

Well, this is one corrupt system the Bidens sit on top of and if that's not enough, Hunter once referred to Patrick Ho and we're quoting, as the ""f-ing spy chief of China,"" according to leaked audio obtained by RealClearPolitics. Here you have the president's son who is talking to his dad about his business deal with China, admitting the guy he is dealing with is the Chinese government spy chief. It's almost unbelievable. Joe Biden has sort of been asked about this. His response? I didn't know anything. Watch.  

Oh, you lie, and now you've been caught lying. So, after the voicemail we played a moment ago, surfaced a few weeks ago proving that Biden lied, the White House was asked about this, not the president directly, but his publicist, the glass ceiling breaking publicist they are always bragging about. Watch the response. 

But secondly, secondly....  

""Alleged materials."" So, they can get away with that because no major news organization in the United States picked up the thread. We tried to. We are a talk show. We flew to Zurich because we thought, ""Wow, maybe there's something there,"" but the big newspapers completely ignored this, even though it's been out there for a year and a half and it's obvious it's not just about Joe Biden being a crackhead who likes hookers. It's about the Biden family, including the president of the United States' business dealings with the government of China, which seeks to displace the United States globally.  

So, because no news organizations would take this up and because law enforcement agencies seem completely uninterested, the FBI has had a copy of this laptop for years now and done nothing with it. It's fallen to people like Jack Maxey to find out what this is about. So, on Sunday, a programmer who worked with Maxey, he posted a livestream video outlining his intention of dropping Hunter Biden's entire hard drive online, along with clues for users to break into the iPhone and iPad backups. He put it on 4Chan, which is some sort of website that basically not very moderated and it's kind of website of last resort for people who want to get information out there but can't because everything is so completely censor at this point.  

Even on 4Chan, the moderators quickly took these links down, but internet users are already seeding the contents of the backups on torrent sites. Bottom line: this is going to live online forever. It's not going away. Now, was it real? We have no reason to believe any of these data are fabricated. We've not independently verified them. We're not putting some of this stuff on the air. It's salacious, but it's pretty obvious that the materials we've looked at are real. At the same time, it's becoming clear that Maxey and his former coders are the only two people making any progress in investigating Hunter Biden's criminal activity. Again, the FBI has done nothing since obtaining the hard drive years ago. Meanwhile, it's raiding people's houses because they (what?) supported Trump in the last election? And the tech companies, as always, are on board, on China's side, once again, censoring any discussion of Hunter Biden's activities, criminal activity, some of which are on video and if you don't believe it, try yourself.  

Type in ""Hunter Biden weighing crack on a scale"" which is out there. Type it into Google and see what happens. You'll get obscure results from random YouTube channels. When you click on Google's news tab, nothing from an American media publication appears. They're stepping on the scale. They're censoring information, as they have from the very beginning. Why are they doing that? Because it matters, that's why. It's not about whether Biden was a druggie. Yeah, he was with a screwed up personal life and a weird personal life. Yeah, knew that. That's not what it's about. They're not protecting Hunter Biden. They're protecting this administration, and they're trying prevent you from understanding this administration's posture toward China.  

Among the latest findings, as reported by Andrew Kerr at The Washington Examiner, are that, ""Joe Biden wired $100,000 to Hunter Biden during the same time frame Hunter Biden spent over $30,000 on Russian escorts who may very well be linked to an Eastern European human trafficking ring."" 

That's a lot like that, but again, the real story is not that Hunter Biden is a crackhead who liked prostitutes and underage girls, although that appears to be very true and law enforcement should look into it,. But for the rest of us, that's not the real story. The real story is that the Biden family was getting rich from business with our enemies. They were selling access to the US government to China and that is a crime. It's certainly a moral crime. As recently as 2020, Joe Biden denied that he or his family had made any money from China. Watch this.  

So, you spent so much time noting Joe Biden's creeping senility that you can overlook the fact that in his lucid moments he's a liar, just flat-out liar. That's a lie. In fact, it's a lie so obvious even The Washington Post, which has carried water for Biden since the very beginning, had to correct it. According to The Washington Post, ""Over the course of 14 months, the Chinese energy conglomerate"" that would be CEFC ""and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle."" That would be Jimmy Biden, the former nightclub owner. 

Are these guys experts on energy? What are they experts on? Nothing, leveraging the U.S. government for personal profit. That's it and it's not just CEFC that funded the Bidens.  

In all, Hunter Biden made more than $30 million from entities affiliated with China's communist government. Hunter Biden's biggest deal with China involved a Chinese investment fund called Bohai Harvest RST or BHR. In December of 2013, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden flew to Beijing. It was a government trip on a government plane and that's when Hunter introduced his father to a BHR executive. Again, that's a flat-out violation of law. You can't take Air Force Two to China to lobby on behalf of the Chinese government, your own father. Full on time. The Bidens denied it, but Hunter eventually took a 10% stake in that company, a stake worth about $20 million. 

Then a Chinese company called Harvest Global wired another $5 million to another company controlled by Hunter Biden, this one called Burnham Asset Management. He's got more companies than your average Mafia's done. According to the Washington Free Beacon, Hunter Biden, ""reached out directly to the firm's chairman"" and said the investment and we're quoting ""would be important to the Biden family."" Biden family, including his dad, the vice president, United States. 

So, what's in it for Harvest Global? Well, per the Free Beacon, ""Biden put together a financial proposal for Burnham to pitch to Harvest that promised 'Washington, D.C., access’ for investors."" They're selling influence, selling influence with the U.S. government. Again, not to Belgium, not to Swaziland, to China, the country that has the United States in its sights.  

They want to displace us as the leader of the world, and they will be cruel masters if they're ever able to do that. Hunter Biden also co-founded a firm famously called Rosemont Realty. This is a good one. Rosemont Realty owns commercial buildings all over the United States. Now, a Hong Kong based firm called Gemini Investments later snapped up Rosemont Realty. Gemini was controlled at the time by ""Sino-Ocean Land"" that was chaired by the head of China Ocean Shipping Corp., or COSCO. As Peter Schweizer reported, Japanese government agencies report that ""Chinese intelligence services are closely linked"" to COSCO. Well, of course they are and that's true of all big Chinese companies. It's not like the United States. They don't have independent big businesses in China.  

They're all arms of the Chinese government. Now, China's President Xi Jinping has called COSCO and we're quoting, "" the dragon's head for China."" What did Hunter Biden make for doing this? About 180 grand. Now, we know of most of this because of reporting from Hunter Biden's laptop, which now everyone admits is authentic, but for more than a year, you were not allowed to talk about the story and now maybe you understand why. It wasn't protecting the feelings of Hunter Biden's family or making fun of his drug addiction or seeing pictures of him with M&Ms stacked on his private parts, yeah whatever. It was about China and that's why the media portrayed it at the time as a conspiracy theory. Watch. 

When you look at this computer store owner in Delaware who allegedly received Hunter Biden's laptop, that is more in line when you think about somebody who's a useful idiot, that's kind of the entry point that is kind of, again, a classic indicator of the potential presence of disinformation. 

Right-wing media has been focused on Hunter Biden, this laptop that intelligence officials have warned is likely Russian disinformation.  

Law enforcement is actively investigating whether the alleged Hunter Biden emails are linked to any foreign intel ops.  

The story is preposterous. So, we're supposed to believe that Hunter Biden in a drunken stupor, dropped off his laptop and I guess in apparently a QAnon repair office.  

So again, having been a rich country for over a hundred years, Americans are not trained to think in geopolitical terms. We're not trained to think in terms of, ""Which country is more powerful than which other country? Who makes the decisions? Who's in charge?"".  

That's the way China thinks of everything. And so this story intersects with the single biggest story taking place generationally in the world and that's the rise of China and the decline of the United States and the Biden family participated directly in that shift of power from the United States to China. Now, in 100 years, this will all be very, very obvious. But in the meantime, do not be distracted. This is not about Hunter Biden arguing with a hooker about how much crack is on the scale. This is about our leaders, the Biden family and not just the Biden family, selling out America, including its most precious assets, to the Chinese gove.rnment.

Imagine you went to school with Sandy Cortez. A lot of people did. Imagine it's 2011, and you're both students at Boston University, a not quite prestigious, but highly expensive school for kids who couldn't get into Tufts. 

You know who Sandy Cortez is because three days a week at 12:20, you see her and your philosophy of gender and sexuality class. She's always there in the front row, snapping her gum and then, like clockwork, she never misses your Queer Theory seminar, which meets every Thursday at 3:30 p.m. because if there's one thing about queer theory scholars, they're not early risers.  

Sandy goes to both, and she talks a lot in both classes. She jumps into the conversation whenever she feels she has something important to say, which is frequently. She's hardly a genius, but she is highly self-assured. She's got strong opinions about racism and cosmetics. She seems to spend a lot of time updating her Facebook page. Those are the main things that you remember about Sandy Cortez.  

Now, fast forward 10 years. Suddenly, Sandy Cortez is a world-famous figure, somehow. She's calling herself , some kind of female Che, Westchester County's first socialist revolutionary and she's still yammering on about racism and eyeshadow, her twin obsessions and she's still frantically updating her social media pages. Some things have not changed, but other things have changed.  

One night you're watching TV and you see Sandy Cortez talking authoritatively about America's energy grid, like she knows a lot about it and that stops you in your tracks. Wait a second. The energy grid, that's an adult thing, right? That's not queer theory. That's real. That's a very complicated piece of infrastructure. Even a lot of engineers don't really understand how the energy grid works. How could Sandy Cortez possibly know anything about that?

She can't drive a standard transmission. She can't program a coffeemaker. She doesn't even make her own bed in the morning. The energy grid? Please, it seems preposterous. So, you grab a beer and you settle in to watch her talk about it and your jaw hangs open as you do. Here's what you see.  

.  

Really? Energy, huh? How is energy generated? Do you know? What's a watt? What's amperage? Speak slowly. We've got time, but she doesn't. Instead, she yells ""the fossil fuel industry and the future of humanity are fundamentally incompatible. They just are. I mean, that's not a political opinion. That's the science."" 

Of course it is. That's the science. Whatever I say is the science. There's no debate here. Obey. That's not how Democracy works. Thank God. You actually have to convince people and so she tried. She introduced the Green New Deal three years ago and it didn't go far. In fact, it went nowhere. In fact, virtually nobody in Congress supported it. In fact, when it came time for a vote on the Green New Deal, even her co-sponsor, the other guy who wrote it, the super woke senator from Massachusetts, voted present, not in favor.  

Now, why is that? Why did nobody actually support it? Well, because if you think cow flatulence is even in the top 200 top issues for most Americans, you're Sandy Cortez. Go back to queer theory class. Get rid of fossil fuels? Yeah. What then? Well, starvation, poverty, societal collapse. Voters, it turns out, are not into any of those things and so nothing that resembles the Green New Deal is going to pass the United States Congress in our lifetimes, provided this remains an actual democracy, which is to say, provided the public has anything to say about how they're governed.  

That's a nonstarter here. It's never going to happen by democratic means, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. It doesn't mean that ideologues can't impose the Green New Deal on weaker countries that are too poor to refuse it and over the past several years, that's exactly what they've done.  

So, the Green New Deal is actually taking effect around the world. So, we don't have to guess what would happen if it took effect here. We can know. That's science. Let's start with Ghana. Ghana's a pretty little country, peaceful place, actually, on the west coast of Africa. Three years ago, Ghana was in great shape. It had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In fact, it had so much energy over most of the last decade, it was exporting it to its neighbors in West Africa.  

Now, those energy exports from Ghana peaked in 2014. Why that year? Well because the next year, the World Bank published this headline on its website, ""World Bank approves largest-ever guarantees for Ghana's Energy Transformation."" Oh, when they promise to transform your energy, slow down.

But Ghana didn't slow down. They just kept going. The World Bank promised to provide, and we're quoting, ""technical assistance for energy sector reforms and the drafting of a new renewable energy law."" So, in return for all this help, Ghana agreed to limit its carbon emissions, and then they entered the Paris climate agreement. Oh, how virtuous. 

What happened next? This is the part you don't read that much about. Last year, Ghana experienced a complete shutdown of its national power supply. No more electricity, no emissions, because we have no electricity, and blackouts have continued since then. Just yesterday, a news source in Ghana reported that, ""Residents in parts of the Ashanti region who have been hit with power cuts are without water as well,"" because it turns out you need electricity to provide water also to grow food. Now, this is not a small thing. The Ashanti region has millions of people living in it. They're all now living in the Stone Age and it's not just the energy grid that's now compromised in Ghana. 

International observers say the country is now facing severe food shortages and hunger, starvation within a matter of months. Why is that? It's a fertile country, hardworking people. Now they're running out of fertilizer. Why? Well, because for years, Sandy Cortez's friends in the NGO community pushed Ghana toward less efficient, more expensive organic fertilizers and the government of Ghana, because it's not a rich government, caved. Last year, according to Ghana's news service, Ghana's agricultural minister, ""urged local farmers to adopt an organic agriculture system to reduce the impact of climate change."" 

Oh, what happened then? Well, the good people of Ghana, while they feel good about their , are now starving and in June, last month, police in Ghana used water and tear gas to attack hundreds of demonstrators in Accra, which is the capital of Ghana.  

It's not just Ghana. The same thing just happened in Sri Lanka. In 2016, the World Economic Forum published an article by a Columbia professor called Joseph Stiglitz, one of the dumbest people on planet Earth, urging Ghana to transition to ""high productivity, organic farming."" Now, what does Stiglitz know about farming? Ever farmed? No, but he felt strongly that Sri Lanka should try a new kind of farming and of course sold it to Sri Lankans as a pathway to prosperity.  

In 2015, the World Economic Forum published an article on its website entitled and we are quoting, ""This is how we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025."" You can search for that article, but it's gone now along with the government of Sri Lanka. So, they had an actual insurrection, not January 6, not a guy in horns, in a bearskin, running around on mushrooms, making weird noises. No, an actual insurrection where they like, come to your house and swim in your swimming pool, root through your sock drawer and make you leave. That's what they did to the people who run Sri Lanka. They, being the public.  

The turning point came in 2021 when the president of Sri Lanka, acting on advice from the World Economic Forum, banned the use and importation of chemical fertilizers. Now, the problem was virtually every farm in Sri Lanka uses those fertilizers to produce food, which it turns out people need every day in order to survive. As a result of that move, food prices in Sri Lanka nearly doubled. Millions more Sri Lankans now live in poverty, which is not a joke and because the economy has collapsed, Sri Lanka now cannot afford fuel imports. So, Sri Lankans are now waiting days for gasoline. Watch. 

What's so interesting is millions of people are now really suffering. The government just fell in Sri Lanka. Now, no one in Sri Lanka is White. They are what our Democratic Party would call people of color and yet the American intellectuals who pushed that disaster in Sri Lanka, who are responsible for the suffering there, have escaped all culpability. No one is saying a word about it. Meanwhile, a cop in Minneapolis was rough with a convicted felon two years ago and we have to stop everything and send him to prison for life, but Joseph Stiglitz is totally fine and it's not just happening, by the way, in the Third World. It's happening even in rich countries. 

The Netherlands, for example, which is a very rich country, the second-biggest food exporter in the world, tried to do, for reasons that are not clear but may have to do with Western guilt, the same thing that leaders in Sri Lanka tried to do. They just ordered farmers to cut virtually all of their nitrogen oxide emissions to ""save the environment."" Now, doing that would shutter most farms in the Netherlands and destroy the country's food supply and once again, that led to riots. So, everything that's happened in Sri Lanka and Ghana and the Netherlands is happening at the behest not simply of ideologues, but of some of the largest financial institutions in the world.  

They want more of this. It's why Ghana has achieved a near-perfect ESG environmental impact score of 97.7. According to World Economic Research, Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1, the Netherlands 90.7. So, the poorer you get, the more human suffering there is, the higher your ESG score and that's important because companies will not invest unless you have a high ESG score. Interesting. So, these countries have no choice and that's why South Africa, for example, works so hard to get an ESG score that now totals 91. 

Now, that effort began in 2015 when South Africa switched to renewables. Now, how did that work? Well, like everything in South Africa, no one in America really wants to know. It's their favorite country. It's a huge success. What's life like in South Africa for people of all colors? Shh, stop. Well, the Guardian, of all places reported at the time, and we are quoting ""solar, biomass and wind energy systems are popping up all over the country and feeding the clean energy into the strained electrical grid."" 

So, their grids have been falling apart since 1994, but no problem. The green energy geniuses are going to save South Africa. How did that work? 

Well, seven years later, The Washington Post reports that South Africa regularly experiences ""rolling blackouts that last 8 hours or more, crippling economic activity and disrupting life in this nation of 60 million people,"" and that's true. Ask anyone who lives there. It's falling apart. Doesn't work.  

Also join France. France is committed to renewable energy. How's that working? Well, France currently has an ESG environmental score of 92.6. Why? Because 10 years ago, France pledged to drive a quarter of all of its energy from renewables in 2018. These policies led to riots. Remember the so-called yellow jackets? People didn't like it. If you cared about democracy, you would listen to them, but no one in charge actually does, so they don't and things have gotten worse since then. This past June, the heads of three French energy companies called on the public to ""immediately reduce consumption of fuel, oil, electricity and gas amid shortages and soaring prices."" 

Oh, stop civilization. It doesn't work. That same month, France's president publicly begged Joe Biden to start producing more oil because the Saudis cannot make enough to supply Europe. Watch. 

So only the Europeans have been dumb enough to embrace this. Unlike Ghana, they could afford not to, but they are anyway out of some weird sense of collective guilt. So, what's happening throughout Europe? In the UK, ESG score of 92.7, the National Infrastructure Commission has warned that as many as 6 million households could face power cuts this summer. Sound like the First World? No, it doesn't, but that's England now. In Germany, ESG score 90.2. The government is now rationing hot water due to an ongoing gas crisis. Officials in Hamburg, Germany's second largest city, just warned that ""warm water could only be made available at certain times of the day in an emergency."" Now, just a few years ago, that Germany's government laughed at warnings from Donald Trump that this would happen. It's on video. ""Yeah, they are so stupid. You have no idea. Green energy is the future."" 

Every place that's been tried has fallen apart. Every single one with no exceptions—Albania, Kenya, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Libya, so on, but it's not just a problem there. It's becoming a problem here. So, the United States are ESG scoring in environmental issues currently stands at 58, but Joe Biden, who buys into every stupid trend, wants to change that. It's very important to get our ESG score up because we want to be more like Ghana. So, at the very moment that Biden is sending our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which we own, he doesn't to his son's business partners in China, he is vowing to end fossil fuels in this country and boost our ESG score. Watch.  

So, let's just be really clear. Fossil fuels aren't just not bad. Fossil fuels aren't just a net good. Fossil fuels are the only thing that stands between the United States becoming Ghana. Fossil fuels are the only thing that make the United States a rich country and not a poor country. We have the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. If we can't tap those, we will be Ghana. We will be poor, but Joe Biden doesn't care and so he is clamping down on our ability to extract them and like the leaders of every other country, driven into the ground by green energy schemes thought up by morons like Sandy Cortez, he's taking no responsibility for the damage he has caused.  

.  

Problem is, he doesn't know anything about refining or extracting or how the grid works or anything about anything because he's never had a real job because he's work for the federal government since he was in his twenties. None of these people have any experience doing anything. Again, most of them can't drive in manual transmission. So, to get a lecture on the power grid or energy from people who have no idea what it is a bit much and the topic is too important to continue to listen to their nonsense as we become poorer. And by the way, as the rift just beneath the surface in American society are exacerbated by that poverty, as GDP drops, societal tension rises. It's dangerous. 

Back off and it's accelerated. In the past year, the United States has experienced blackouts in some of our biggest states. Why? Because they're relying more and more on renewables, places like California and even Texas. Just yesterday, in order to avoid a blackout, the largest grid operator in the state of Texas, begged residents to turn up their thermostats, no more AC for you and ask them not to use any major appliances, really, in Texas, which is the largest oil and gas reserves in the continental United States.  

What are they doing in Texas? But across the country, this is true. Orlando, Florida recently experiment with fertilizer bans to ""curb pollution."" So, the World Economic Forum wants a lot more of this. They just released a position paper calling for countries to ""agree to end the underpricing of fossil fuels, which is the principal factor preventing a clean energy transition."" 

In other words, it's too cheap. It works too well. Gas needs to be higher so you won't be able to use it. So, you'll have to be poor. And they're saying this as we're watching countries around the world – we can give you more detail, you see the point – are collapsing and entering into a state of revolution because these morons tampered with their energy grids. But they don't care. They're going to continue doing it unless someone stops them until exactly the same thing happens here. That's true.

When we say good evening, we mean it and tonight, we want to send a special, as they say on talk radio, shout out to our most loyal and faithful viewers. We love you. We appreciate you. In fact, we think of you as all little tacos and your children as taquitos and not just tacos and taquitos, but also enchiladas and chalupas and everything else on the Taco Bell menu. That's how we think of you. 

So, the good news is America at this stage is getting a lot more amusing. The bad news is it's also getting a little scary. So today, in the second category, the government announced that inflation has once again set a year-over-year record. But now we're used to this. If you buy anything, you already knew it was happening. Boy, did you. But there were parts of today's Labor Department report that were not expected by anyone. In fact, they were bizarre. They seemed to defy the most basic rules of economics, but first, here are the raw numbers. This is from a Fox News report today. 

So, the biggest annual spike in inflation in more than 40 years. That's the headline. But if anything, it understates what's actually going on. The reality of it is worse than that. During the Carter years, when inflation famously hit 14.6%, wages were still going up. As Pew put it in a recent analysis, ""During the high inflation years of the 1970s and early 1980s, average wages commonly jumped seven, eight, even 9% year over year"" and that makes sense. There's more money in circulation. It's worth less, but there's more of it. But that is not what is happening right now and that's the weird thing.  

According to the Labor Department report today, ""Real average hourly earnings decreased 3.6%, seasonally adjusted from June 2021 to June 2022. The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a decrease of 0.9% of the average workweek, resulted in a 4.4% decrease in real average weekly earnings over this period."" 4.4% average decrease in earnings. This is what economic disaster looks like.  

Americans are making less money at exactly the moment when everything they buy from gas to groceries is more expensive and not just a little more expensive, a lot more expensive. Here's the big picture. The average American household income this year is about $87,000. 

Today's inflation numbers means the average household is losing nearly $8,000 a year just from inflation. By the way, that's using the government's cooked numbers, the 9.1% inflation number, which is derived from the intentionally deceptive consumer price index (CPI), so the real number is actually higher than that. Rising inflation with falling wages. This is very bad, and as we said, it's also very weird. How weird? Well, here's one measure of the strangeness. The  is now much cheaper in Mexico than it is in the United States, and that's why so many Californians are now driving across the border to fill their cars. 

Now, why is this happening? That does not make sense. Oil prices set on the international market. But apart from a few outlier websites like ZeroHedge, which not coincidentally the left is always trying to shut down and censor, no one seems to be asking that question. We do know that gas prices in Mexico are so cheap that the Mexican government is encouraging more Americans to cross the border to refuel their cars.  

""Right now,"" said the president of Mexico this week, ""a gallon of regular cost $4.78 average on your side of the border, while in Mexico, it cost $3.12."" So, you have to ask yourself if we're paying more for gas because of Putin's price hike, why isn't Mexico paying more for gas because of Putin, too? Why is inflation up when wages are down? This doesn't make any sense. So, if you want to answer those questions, you really have to look at government spending.  

Last month, Mexico's government did not follow the Biden administration's lead in sending the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. They did not do that. Instead, here's what Mexico did. They spent $2 billion in subsidies to keep gas prices lower for consumers. In other words, the government of Mexico in the middle of a drug war is taking better care of its citizens than Joe Biden is taking care of his citizens and that is shameful, but it doesn't mean Joe Biden is ignoring the needy.  

In the very same month, the gas prices shot beyond the reach of people, people aren't taking trips because of gas prices, Joe Biden, in the name of democracy, signed a $40 billion aid package, not for you or any other American, but for Ukraine and that money, Joe Biden says, is just the beginning. It's part of our unlimited commitment to funding Ukraine's corrupt and authoritarian government. Here's Biden. 

Future generations will look at that tape and many tapes like it with their jaws open. As long as it takes! Whatever the cost for Ukraine! As the American economy heads toward total destruction, Ukrainians are dying in large numbers, who's winning? Well, Ukrainian oligarchs, they're getting richer, much richer. Since January of this year, the Biden administration has sent about $8 billion just in so-called security assistance alone to Ukraine. That would include missile systems, howitzers, ammunition, radar systems, etc., etc. 

Now, defense contractors are making a ton from this, and that's why they have lobbied for it so hard, but you have to ask, once we send these weapons to Ukraine, where do they go then? What happens to them? These are sophisticated and deadly weapons systems. Well, no one knows where they go. No one's keeping track. U.S. officials, Biden administration officials have admitted that to The Wall Street Journal and we're quoting: ""Once U.S. equipment material is handed to the Ukrainian government U.S. officials said they have little direct knowledge of where that material goes. They rely instead on the Ukrainian government for such information. The administration has not agreed to allow American military troops to conduct some oversight into that country.""

Huh?

So, you send billions to Ukraine in the middle of a war, and then you don't bother to find out what happens to it? What will happen to these weapons? Well, the Czech defense minister knows he has said these weapons, some of them will be smuggled out of Ukraine, ""It's hard to avoid trafficking or smuggling. We didn't achieve it in the former Yugoslavia and we probably won't avoid it in Ukraine."" 

This is lunacy. If you wanted to make Eastern Europe dangerous and unstable for generations, ensure that war continues and many more die, this is exactly what you would do. You would treat Ukraine like we treated Afghanistan, but that's just the beginning of the money we're sending. On top of all of this security assistance, now, the head of USAID, that would be Samantha Power – she's never left, she's still here, amazingly, after wrecking the world – she's announced we're sending $4 billion more to Ukraine to pay off that country's budget deficit. Wouldn't that be nice if Samantha Power decided to pay off our budget deficit, if anyone decided to help us? But no, no one would ever do that.  

So, your tax dollars are now paying the salaries of Ukrainian government bureaucrats. In all, your Congress has approved more than $50 billion for Ukraine. That includes $7 billion in food assistance and health care, along with $9 billion for economic support, whatever that means. There's also $2 billion for refugee assistance. So, just as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan and I don't know, half a dozen other countries, we're sending bales of $100 bills into a war zone and hoping they find the right pockets.

Again, this is nuts. And yet leaders of both parties agree we have to keep doing it, much more of it.  

Dozens of Democrats in Congress just signed a letter pushing the administration, as if they needed to be pushed, toward the International Monetary Fund, a total of $650 billion in new funding because Ukraine and on top of all of that, Congressman Adam Kinzinger just proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act calling for another hundred million for, ""Ukrainian military pilots and associated personnel."" Kinzinger is the guy who thought the ghost of Kiev was real.

Now all of this is necessary. It's mandatory. We must, according to members of both parties, because we must defend democracy. Now we're not picking on Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Republican state, but we want to show you this tape. He just sat for an interview with Charlie Kirk and explained that we have to send an unlimited amount of money to Ukraine. Why? To ""fight back against communist intrusion for the cause of freedom because Vladimir Putin is evil."" Watch.  

Yeah. Fighting the communist menace. These people never update their talking points. Senator Cramer invokes the cause of liberty and that's a phrase we strongly support. That's an idea we strongly support. That's why we're in favor of unfettered free speech. That's why we oppose vaccine mandates. But you have to ask yourself, what does the cause of liberty have to do with Ukraine? Well, very little. Last February, the Ukrainian government shut down opposition media. Then they arrested the leader of the main opposition party. 

Now, President Zelenskyy has decided to combine all television stations in Ukraine into a state-owned propaganda ministry in order to combat ""misinformation."" Now, what is that? Well, I'll tell you what, it's not. It's not the profile of a free country. Not even close. The cause of liberty. May those words burn in your mouth. ""Oh, but we have to,"" they tell us,"" because Putin is worse. He's the worst person in the world."" He's a communist, says Senator Camer, who plans to conquer the globe.

You don't have to like Vladimir Putin to see how absurd this is. Putin's a communist now. Really? How communist is Vladimir Putin? Is Vladimir Putin more or less communist than, say, Sandy Cortez? More or less communist than say Joe Biden's domestic policy team? Is he more committed atheist than they are? Is Putin throwing Americans in jail for attending political rallies at the Capitol? Is he trying to confiscate the rifles from your bedroom? Is he sterilizing children in the name of trans liberation? Whatever his many faults, no, Vladimir Putin is not doing any of that. 

As for his apparently limitless international ambitions, ask yourself, is Vladimir Putin recolonizing Africa right now? Is Vladimir Putin trying to build military bases in the Caribbean and South America? No, he's not, but another country is. That would be China, Joe Biden's patron. Putin wants Crimea. He may succeed in getting it, but it is China that is on its way to controlling the world. Here's a graphic we saw today that illustrates the point.  

These are the relative sizes of the players in the global economy. The numbers are from the IMF. As you can see, the world is completely dominated by the economic power of China and the United States. As of today, our two economies roughly equal in size, though thanks to COVID, China is quickly pulling ahead. That is a problem. In fact, that is the biggest problem in the world by far. Nothing comes close because the Chinese empire will not be like our empire at all. 

So, where's Russia in this? How does it fit in? Well, get your reading glasses, because Russia is a footnote. It's not irrelevant, but it's close to irrelevant.Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's. The Italians, in other words, are in a better position to take over the  world than Vladimir Putin is.

This entire conversation is insane. Anyone who takes it seriously is a fool, and anyone who doesn't see the red flags is probably dishonest. The most dishonest, the most power-hungry people in the United States are the very ones yelling the loudest for a war with Russia. That would be Joe Biden. That would be Nancy Pelosi. That'd be Chuck Schumer. That'd be Adam Schiff.  

These are the people telling you that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal bent on world domination. Why are they saying that? Why are you suggesting Vladimir Putin's going to take over Europe? That's not true, but why are they saying it?  

Well, there's a reason, a reason that has precisely nothing to do with saving lives or making Ukraine a better country. Again, red flag, anyone? And yet somehow Republicans don't see it. They don't seem curious about why the worst people in America are for an endless  In fact, apart from Marjorie Taylor Greene and a few other Republicans in Congress, they are all in. Whatever Joe Biden wants in Ukraine they support. Here, for example, is Lindsey Graham with his little friend Richard Blumenthal, that would be Connecticut's most famous Vietnam War hero. Here they are together.  

  

Defeat Putin. Will that improve your life? Is it improving the lives of the Ukrainians right now? No, it's not and yet every person who has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision going back 40 years is on the same page and that, of course, would include John Bolton, the former national security adviser, who by the way just admitted on national television that he has personally engineered coups in foreign countries. Wait, we're not for democracy? Apparently not. John Bolton isn't. But wasn't democracy the whole point? Were those coups statesponsored terror? No one's asking. No one's calling John Bolton a war criminal. Instead, here's what they're saying.  

Wait, what? I tuned in to find out whether I should buy Cisco on the dip and you're a foreign policy expert now. The American economy is in serious trouble. It's heading south faster than anyone anticipated, but instead, you flip on CNBC and the geniuses are talking about World War III, and they're not the only ones. So, if you want to know how big this has become, how ominous this is, in the absence of attention from the rest of us, we've kind of slept walked up to this point, you should see this. This is from the city of New York, our largest city. This is a public service announcement reminding the 8 million residents of New York they could soon be nuked. 

What? Now, if you were drinking beer and that came on TV, you'd think maybe she was giving you advice on what to do if your basement floods or if there was a heat wave. Then you get to the part where she says ""radioactive dust"" and you snap to it. Radioactive dust? You're suggesting that someone might lob a nuclear weapon into our largest city? What? Why the chirpy tone? What the hell are you talking about? 

How do we get so close to nuclear war that the city of New York is telling me to wash the radioactive dust off my pants? This is total lunacy. This is crazy. Why are we doing this? Because Putin's bad and he's going to take over Belgium? 

Because nobody has said anything and because the Republican Party has collaborated with the nutcases in the Biden administration, we have reached the point where some chirpy lady on TV is telling you to prepare for the deaths of tens of millions of Americans. Wake up.

Nobody wants to talk about COVID anymore, and that's certainly understandable. This country lost so much in two years. It's depressing to think about it and the instinct is just to move on, but unfortunately, we don't have that luxury and for two reasons.  

First, politicians are continuing to use the virus as a pretext to force their agendas on an unwilling and weary population. That's happening still, believe it or not and second, and maybe more significantly, long term, somebody has got to rescue science from the ideologues who all of a sudden have taken it over. Science must be objective. Science must be honest. Otherwise, everything falls apart. 

So, with that in mind, this story. In April of last year, researchers at the CDC concluded a months long study of thousands of health care workers. They included first responders, nurses and physicians. The point of the study was to assess whether the COVID vaccine was working. Researchers split the health care workers into two groups, vaccinated and unvaccinated, and then they watched. What they found was so significant that the head of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, went directly to MSNBC to tell the world what researchers had found and here's what she said.  

This is word for word: ""Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick and that's not just in clinical trials, but also in real-world data."" Now, that turned out not simply to be untrue, but in some sense to be the opposite of the truth. In some cases, the vaccinated are more likely to get variants of COVID. The death rates around the world for the  are extraordinarily high, but at the time, anyone who had doubts about what Rochelle Walensky said was told to shut up.  

Those who questioned her out loud were kicked off social media. If you kept questioning, you might be fired from your job. Doubting Rochelle Walensky's promises, doubting the Biden administration's claims about the COVID vaccine was totally unacceptable. It was like questioning their views on herd immunity or mandatory masking for children or airline passengers or closing the schools.  

Now that we know that virtually everything they said about COVID was wrong, however, no one has admitted it, and no one has been punished. No one at the CDC was fired for this. In fact, they were elevated. Under Joe Biden, the people who made these claims, these false claims, have even more power than ever. Rochelle Walensky is back on television. She's demanding that parents force their children as young as six months old to . They're all saying this, Tony Fauci, Joe Biden too. Watch.  

Amazingly, despite all of their demonstrated failures, all of their documented dishonesty, those three people are still, as of tonight, in charge of this country's response to COVID. It's remarkable, if you think about it. So, parents thinking about how to treat their own children are in a very tough position. One of the COVID shots that Walensky and Fauci and Biden are telling you to give your small kids is manufactured by Moderna.  

Now, you might recall that Moderna's COVID vaccine for adults was suspended from use in several countries after researchers found that it caused potentially very dangerous heart inflammation in young people. The other COVID vaccine that's been approved for toddlers in the United States is made by Pfizer. Pfizer's vaccine for adults has also been linked to heart damage, to myocarditis in young people. So, a lot of parents are wondering, should we give this to our toddler? How do we find the answer?  

Virtually every news show in America seems to be sponsored by Pfizer, so clearly turning on television is not going to give you an answer you can trust. You need to find an independent, science-minded researcher or physician who's looked at the actual data. And there are very few who who've done that and are willing to be honest about it.  is one of them. He's just written a remarkable piece in Bari Weiss' Substack, and he wrote it with epidemiologist Tracy Hoeg.  

Makary and Hoeg found that Pfizer and Moderna provided, and were quoting, ""extremely weak, inconclusive data"" to justify vaccinating children as young as six months in the United States. ""Using a three-dose vaccine in 992 children between the ages of six months and five years, Pfizer found no statistically significant evidence of vaccine efficacy,"" they wrote. ""In the subgroup of children aged six months to two years of trial found that the vaccine could result in a 99% lower chance of infection, but that they also have a 370% increased chance of being infected."" 

What does that mean? We have no idea, and we don't know how you would know because those data are completely incoherent. They do not present a picture that suggests a path forward. They're inherently confusing. Meanwhile, Moderna ""claimed a very weak vaccine efficacy of just 4% in children aged six months to two years."" That is not a statistically significant result either. 

So, based on those numbers, apparently those are the underlying numbers, how could the Biden administration, how could the people who run public health in the United States of America push for the immediate  over the ages of six months? We need to assess what exactly these data are and why public health agencies seem to be ignoring them.

696	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-cognitively-unable-serve-democrats-known	2022-07-15 22:15:00	Tucker Carlson: Biden is cognitively unable to serve and Democrats have known this for years | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices concerns about President Biden's alleged mental decline on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here's an interesting story. Ronny Jackson is a physician. He joined the White House medical unit many years ago under President George W Bush. He stayed in that job. He went on to serve as physicians to the two subsequent presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, so Ronny Jackson knows a lot about what it takes to run the country.  

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Jackson was home watching Joe Biden deliver a speech, and what he saw Biden say bothered him deeply as a physician. Biden had just announced that he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Watch.  

So, Ronny Jackson saw that and then went on Twitter and he made the obvious point.  before this goes any further, should undergo a cognitive examination. The country deserves that. Well, within 20 minutes, Jackson recalls in his new memoir, Barack Obama sent him an email, a characteristically sneering one and we're quoting, ""I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter,"" Obama said. ""It was unprofessional. I expect better."" 

So, that wasn't just Obama speaking. That was the uniform command of the people who run the Democratic Party throughout the 2020 campaign. Do not notice what Joe Biden is actually like. If you see him on television turn away because you might conclude he is fundamentally, physically, cognitively unfit for office. You can't say that and if you do, Barack Obama will scold you personally immediately. 

Well, fast-forward a few years. Joe Biden is now the president and his mental decline is no longer possible to deny, and therefore it's no longer off limits. Barack Obama isn't going out and defending Joe Biden's competence anymore. Everybody watching, everyone in the media, that would include Barack Obama's former advisers, is now in agreement that Joe Biden is senile and cannot govern the United States.  

So, the problem with Joe Biden, says, Mark McKinnon, is that he's White. Notice the casual racism of the left, 2022. It's ubiquitous. You barely even notice it. That's not the problem with Joe Biden. Who cares what his skin color is? The problem Joe Biden is he's cognitively unable to serve, but take three steps back. That's not Joe Biden's fault. It's not his fault he has dementia.  

No, the fact that Joe Biden is president is an indictment of the media and the Democratic Party because they have known. Contrary to what they're telling you now, , his fullblown senility has been obvious for more than three years. We noticed. We're not doctors. By the way, we had no special animus toward Joe Biden at all, but we watched him and we said this out loud for the first time, we checked today, on May 14, 2019.  

But wait a second, you're saying to yourself, that didn't make any sense. Not a single phrase in a full minute of talking conveyed an intelligible idea, not one. That wasn't even word salad. It was a verbal Jackson Pollack painting. Nouns, verbs, adjectives spilled like cans of paint bleeding into each other—a sticky, post-modern mess. At one point, Biden actually jumped from point two directly to point four just to let you know that your old-fashioned linear assumptions about numerical sequencing are no good here, man. That's yesterday's mathematics.  

So, we put it on the air back in 2019. Again, not because we are particularly against Joe Biden. He seemed a lot better than Beto O'Rourke or Mayor Pete. We put it on because we happened to be watching one day and tried to follow what he was saying about China because it seemed important. Not one national news organization had noted at all that this guy couldn't speak in complete sentences, couldn't convey coherent ideas. Nobody had ever mentioned that and of course, anyone in Washington who knew Joe Biden. He had been there since 1972 and basically most people kind of liked him. He was a friendly guy. 

This was not the Joe Biden anyone who knew Joe Biden had seen before. He completely changed. This was clearly cognitive decline. This was dementia, obviously. So, we drew a conclusion that now sounds ridiculous, but it seemed logical at the time. This guy can't be the Democratic nominee. He can barely speak. How did he manage to get through the campaign? Well, it turned out, we learned later, his staff supervised by Dr. Jill, his wife, was giving him pills before every public appearance, checking the time in at a certain hour, giving him a dose of something. Now, it's not a guess. We're not making that up. We've spoken directly to someone who was there and saw it happen multiple times.  

Now, before taking the medication, this person said, Biden was ""like a small child. You couldn't communicate with him."" He changed completely because he was on drugs and he clearly still is on drugs. No one's pushing to know what those drugs are. We should know. But the point is, Joe Biden's dementia was perfectly obvious to everyone around him more than three years ago. So, we never thought this could happen. You can't make a senile man, president of the United States. This is our country. This is a real country. It needs a real leader even one you disagree with, but someone is in full possession was faculties. No one would ever do that. It's crazy.  

We were completely wrong. We were wrong because we underestimated the cynicism and the recklessness of the Democratic Party and the media who serve them. They will say literally anything, no matter how implausible or immoral, if it brings them more power. They knew exactly how incapacitated Joe Biden was. They lied about it and the disaster we're living with today is a direct result of their lying and it's getting worse. It's humiliating. 

Yesterday, for example, we could go on for an hour, we're not going to, but just to sum it up, yesterday Joe Biden tried to shake an invisible man's hand. Not the first time he's done this. He did the same thing in April and both of those sad moments are on tape. Here they are.  

So, if you don't like Biden or his agenda and we certainly don't, there is a kind of partisan glee you take from this. Look how pathetic he is but, you know, if you're an American, there's no upside. Actually, this is horrible for all of us. It reflects poorly not just on the Democratic Party or Biden himself, but on our country and it's happening constantly with increasing frequency. On Wednesday of this week, during a trip to Israel. Biden announced that we have to keep alive the ""honor of the Holocaust."" 

It's just absolutely awful and again, there's no upside. So, Joe Biden's senile. Everybody knows it. Do we win a prize now? No. We watch our country degrade. So, you have to ask, who did this to the rest of us? Who's responsible for putting this guy in a position where he was elected president? Well, we could start the list of the culpable with Joe Biden's 2020 campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon. She did this. Where is she now? Well, she's now deputy chief of staff in the White House. 

She knew exactly how senile Joe Biden was. Susan Rice knew well, too. Of course, she did. Susan Rice now runs America's domestic policy out of the White House. Ron Klain knew perfectly well that Joe Biden was not fit to be president, that he has dementia. Ron Klain was elevated to White House chief of staff and of course, Dr. Jill, his wife, was perfectly aware. Members of Joe Biden's own family knew perfectly well and told other people about it. We've reported that before and it's true and yet they didn't stop him.  

Mike Donilon was the chief strategist of Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Now he's one of Biden's ""senior advisers."" Same with Anita Dunn. She was once co campaign manager. She's now another senior adviser for Biden and a former Obama communications director. She has massive power in this country. That's how she was rewarded for foisting this guy on the rest of us. Brian Deese, same thing. The man who screwed up our climate and energy policy during the Obama years, he knew perfectly well Joe Biden was senile, but he wanted power again. So, he didn't say a word. Once again, same principle at work.  

People make grave errors in judgment. They do something horrible to the United States of America, and they're rewarded for it. They're never punished. They're rewarded. These people now run the country

And above all, Barack Obama. Barack Obama knew perfectly well that Joe Biden was senile. Barack Obama spent eight years making fun of Joe Biden and degrading Joe Biden. Because Joe Biden has no dignity, He put up with it, but Obama knew that Biden wasn't fit to be president and that matters because Obama is and has always been the person actually running the Democratic Party and of course, the media knew. They knew perfectly well, but they lied. From day one, they lied. Here they are telling us during the campaign that Joe Biden actually (shut up, ageist) he just is perfectly fine.  

  

Every one of those people knew. Again, we knew and said so out loud not because we have some special entree into the secrets of the Democratic Party. We certainly don't. Were hardly Democratic Party insiders, but because we watch TV for 90 seconds and we saw unmistakably the signs of dementia in Joe Biden. Every one of the people you just saw lied about what they knew. 

They hid that fact from you and the rest of the country because they wanted more power, but now the game is over for Joe Biden. As Mark McKinnon said he's just too White. So, suddenly our media is admitting what we noted three years ago and that everyone knew, that this was a scam. They are living with the mess they created, and we hope that they will never be allowed to avoid responsibility for what they did.

As we reported on Friday,  from such severe dementia during the 2020 presidential campaign that his wife and his staff medicated him before his public appearances. We're not guessing about that. We spoke directly to an eyewitness who saw it happen multiple times. 

That means that everyone around Joe Biden has known perfectly well for more than three years that he is incapable of serving as president and yet knowing that they foisted him on the country anyway. Why did they do that? Well, of course, to carry out a task, to carry out the revolution, then the historic protections of free speech and self-defense in the United States, to hobble domestic energy production, to scramble gender roles until no one can think clearly and then hook the middle class on federal handouts. That was his job. 

Like certain species of marsupials, Joe Biden's task was to do one big thing. In his case, change the country forever and then disappear. We've reached the disappearing part right about now. Democrats would like Joe Biden gone soon. He's longer useful to them. He's just embarrassing. He shakes hands with thin air. He compliments the Holocaust on state trips to Israel. Can't do that. So, not surprisingly, almost 70% of Democratic voters don't want Joe Biden to run again. So, you can be certain that he won't. No matter what his staff is claiming now, they don't want to be relegated to lame duck status, so they're pretending otherwise, but no matter what they say, you will never hear another word from Joe Biden after January of 2025, assuming he makes it that long.  

So, the question really is, who replaces Joe Biden? The scramble begins now. Now, it's early enough that we can't really say. We can't say at all, in fact. The only thing we can say is which candidate seems to believe they could be the next Democratic nominee. And so far, it is an amazing lineup that reveals a lot about the state of the Democratic Party 2022. 

First on the list, believe it or not, is the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker is an inherited money dolt. He's impressed not a single person who knows him, but he yet spent more than $171 million of his family's money to get a job that he does not seem to enjoy and certainly isn't very good at. J.B. Pritzker is one of the last people on Earth who should be running anything and yet somehow he's convinced himself he's going to be the next president. Here's J.B. Pritzker in New Hampshire in June. 

Imagine the consultant who convinced J.B. Pritzker to leave his collapsing state and head to New Hampshire because really, you're going to be president, J.B. So, he's running. Who else is running? Well, if you want to know the answer to that, look around and ask yourself which elected Democrats are attacking Ron DeSantis? He's the candidate they think, many of them believe, they will face. So, who's attacking Ron DeSantis? Well, here's  He's got a new ad in Florida. Watch.  

Come join us in California. Leave Florida. He's got some wuevos. You got to give him that. Gavin Newsom then gave a television interview, not saying he's running for president, but suggesting that maybe you speculate about it. Watch.  

He's walking outside the White House without his jacket on, flexing a little bit and those teeth. Where did he get those teeth? We'd like to know the man who installed them. So those are the two most prominent people as of tonight who apparently believe they can replace Joe Biden. That would be the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, and the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker.  

Now, if you're not laughing right now, you're dead inside, not least because of the way they look and yes, appearance not simply matters of the Democratic Party, it is determinative. That party has spent the last decade telling us that White men are evil. White men must be removed from positions of leadership except within their party, where White men continue to run everything.  

What does that remind you of? It's kind of like flying private to the global warming summit or going maskless as you enforce COVID mandates, both of which  and Gavin Newsom have done. So, they've passed the hypocrisy test already. But as long as the anti-White party is going to ignore highly qualified leaders of color like Stacey Abrams or Tiara Mack of Rhode Island, and instead continuing to run White men, you think they can at least pick non-ridiculous White men, but no. Instead, they are getting behind the two guys who run the most dysfunctional states out of 50.  

How do we know that? By what people do. Ignore what people say. Be more like your dog. Watch actions. Ignore words. More people are emigrating from California, which is to say fleeing from California, than from any other state in the country and some of them are literally running to Mexico in the middle of a drug war in search of a better life, and they're getting it, that's the thing.

Californians now pay more income tax than any other state, and yet there's more poverty in California than any other state. California leads the nation in homelessness. They are everywhere. Check an overpass in L.A. County. People living under it. American citizens. In the last two years, murders in L.A. went up by 35%. Already in the first half of this year, homicides in Los Angeles have set a 15-year record.

You're going to run on that, Gavin Newsom? They're robbing trains in your state like it's 1880. And then there's Illinois, and we don't want to be mean. Both are great states, nice people, the ones who haven't yet moved to Florida, it's about four of them left.  

Illinois ranks third in net migration. New York's in the middle, between California and Illinois. The Chicago-Naperville area lost 107,000 people just last year. That's one of the highest losses for any metropolitan region in the United States. L.A. and San Francisco also right near the top of that list. So, again, if you want to judge someone's success, ask yourself, are people moving to the place that person governs or are they running at high speed in the other direction?

Illinois and California are in the second category. According to the Illinois Policy Institute, Illinois loses a resident every 4 minutes. Now, how many people is that? Well, over a year. That's the equivalent of losing the entire city of Springfield, which is the capital of Illinois. 

How many are going to Florida? Well, most of them. One of the reasons that Illinois isn't safe anymore is because people with jobs are leaving. As of July 10th year-to-date, total crimes in the city of Chicago are up 34% year over year. Now, who's responsible for this? Hmm, who's running it? Well, J.B. Pritzker is running it. And everyone who lives there, who still lives there, who's too tired to get out or can afford to flee to Broward County, is mad about it and that's why every time J.B. Pritzker goes outside, sweating profusely, he gets yelled at. Watch.  

There he is with a mask on outside. You just imagine him going back to his box and saying, ""What were they saying?"" ""They love you, governor, they love you,""

But they don't and they shouldn't. Under J.B. Pritzker, Illinois has become much poorer, much more dangerous, and much less free. The violent crime rate in Chicago has increased by nearly 40%. Again, his state. So, what does he done about that? How many lives is you saved? No, you know, the real problem, says J.B. Pritzker, it's law-abiding people in Indiana who own guns. It's your fault. Watch.  

.  

Oh, haranguing in the public, people who have done literally nothing wrong except try to protect their own homes from the criminals that J.B. Pritzker has loosed on the state of Illinois. No wonder they're screaming at him. He doesn't punish criminals. He attacks law abiding citizens instead and that's a theme with Pritzker. He's the one who imposed a mask mandate on schools in the state based on no, on oh, precisely zero scientific evidence, none and parents understood it. Their kids were being destroyed by this. So, here's how parents in Naperville reacted earlier this year. Watch. 

So, you'd think if you'd inherited as much money as J.B. Pritzker has – billions – you wouldn't need to listen to the teachers' unions. You fund your campaigns. Why do you care what the teachers' unions think, which, ironically, are the national focus of anti-children policies? Find anybody in America who dislikes children as thoroughly and intensely as the teachers unions do, and that person should be in jail, but J.B. Pritzker not only listens to the teachers' unions, he is their slave. So, once you start thinking irrationally and once science has no bearing whatsoever on your public health policy, God knows we're going to wind up. In J.B. Pritzker's case, he banned families from stepping on boats because it was dangerous. Watch.  

Hey, greaseball where did you get the right to tell me how many people can come on my boat? Nobody asked that question. ""Well, really, It's on the boat or on the dock."" Nobody said anything and so J.B. Pritzker kept going, listing was consoles, ""They love you,"" but nothing changes the bottom-line fact. Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker run the dirtiest, most dangerous state in the country with the worst cities—Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, great places, all, all places that have been destroyed and the basis of that record of destruction, they become convinced they run the country. They need to be president. Now, if that's not hilarious, what is?  

These are ridiculous people. Newsom looks like an ad for a plastic surgery clinic. Ah, look at the teeth. J.B. Pritzker can barely walk to the podium. So again, who's the consultant who managed to keep a straight face while telling J.B. Pritzker he could be president? We'd love that man's name. ""People love you, J.B. You can do it.""

698	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-great-replacement-electoral-strategy	2022-07-19 22:51:00	Tucker Carlson: The great replacement is an electoral strategy | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to United States' population growth being fueled by migration on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Looking back, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 turned out to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever passed by the U.S. Congress. Now, the people who wrote it knew that it would be so naturally spent a lot of time trying to convince everyone else that, in fact, it was no big deal. 

""This is not a revolutionary bill,"" assured Lyndon Johnson when he signed it – he first tip that it was, in fact, a revolutionary bill. And then there was this. On the Senate floor, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, the man who drove the bill, went out of his way to explain that the Democratic Party was absolutely not trying to replace the American population with more compliant foreign-born voters. No way. That's an insane conspiracy theory he explained. ""This bill will not flood our cities with immigrants,"" Kennedy said. ""It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs."" 

It's all bitterly amusing when you look back at it, because, of course, that is precisely what this bill did. This bill changed America completely and forever and the numbers show it. In the years since that legislation passed, the United States total population exploded by 140 million people. You're seeing that chart on your screen right now. What direction does it point? Well, steadily upward. That's the population.  

Now, where did all those people come from? Nothing wrong with more people. The question is, who are they and where do they come from? Well, what you're seeing is not the kind of organic growth that you would see in a healthy society that's become more prosperous and welcoming of families. It's not like people were so confident in the future they decided to have more kids. No, it's just the opposite, exactly the opposite of that.  

In fact. Since Ted Kennedy's bill became law, birth rates among native born Americans, which are the clearest possible measure of optimism in the future, those have dropped off a cliff and you're seeing that chart on the screen now. It's the inverse of the first chart. This chart points downward. In 2020, the most recent year for which we have data, the overall fertility rate in the United States hit the lowest point ever recorded, and that was before COVID. This country is now well under the so-called replacement level. That means if we continue on this trajectory and no one's trying to take us off this trajectory, eventually there will be no more native-born Americans. 

So you put these two graphs together, and what do they show you? Well, they show you a number of things, but here's the main one. Sometime around 1965, our leaders stopped trying to make the United States a hospitable place for American citizens, their constituents, to have their own families. That used to be considered the central task of leadership -- perpetuating the population. If people are happy and confident, they'll have kids.  

They're vested in the society and if they're not, they won't. That was their job. So, they stopped doing it and instead they just imported new people. That's literally what happened. Now, you're not allowed to point this out, of course. The media become absolutely hysterical when you do because it's so obviously true. What's interesting is that if something like this happened in any other country, say, in China or Japan or Nigeria, the populations of those countries would likely revolt because you can't do that. 

The leaders of a country can't change the population of the country, especially in a democracy without the consent of the existing population. So, if those populations in, say, Nigeria, for example, revolted, the New York Times should be deeply sympathetic to their outrage. Again, you can't just replace the electorate because you didn't like the last election outcomes. That would be the definition of undermining democracy, changing the voters. But when it happens in this country, there is mandatory media enforced silence and in fact, if you notice it's happening, it's your fault. You're immoral. You're a racist, but it has nothing to do with race. It's about change and it's absolutely real.  

The majority of population growth since 1965 has come from immigration, not from Americans having more kids. In 1965, the number of permanent illegal migrants in this country from Latin America was essentially zero. They were migrant farm workers, but there were no huge populations of people living here illegally. By 2008, that number had grown to perhaps 20 million people. They lied about it, but the best estimates suggest it was tens of millions.

And then came Joe Biden. Joe Biden accelerated that sad trend beyond what anyone thought was possible. The foreign-born population is now growing by 132,000 people every month.  

That's more than triple the average high under previous administrations. It's double Barack Obama's highest totals. According to AEI scholar Mark Perry, we can expect over 9 million new illegal aliens by the end of Joe Biden's first term. Nothing like this has ever happened in this or maybe any other country ever and it's happening for one reason. It's not natural. It's the product of a policy choice. Joe Biden promised amnesty to anyone who makes it across our border. So, in 2019, for example, the Trump administration criminally prosecuted 110,000 illegal migrants for violating immigration law. Not that they were bad people. Some of them were great people, but you're not allowed to go into someone else's country without permission. That's what the law is and if you ignored the law, you are no longer a real country.  

You're something less than that. You're a failed state. So, you have to enforce the law, including immigration law, but Joe Biden stopped doing it. Last year, Joe Biden prosecuted fewer than 3000 total. That's according to DHS data obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. That's a drop of nearly 98%. So naturally, people are coming because why wouldn't you want to move to the United States knowing that when you get here, you will be treated like someone who deserves to be here and given every possible public benefit? You'd be crazy not to come and so they are in massive numbers and then traveling, often at public expense paid for by you without your knowledge, throughout the United States. Watch one border agent explain what exactly is happening.  

  

So, here's another thing that's changed since 1965, along with our population. Politicians no longer feel they need to pretend, partly because the population is so different. You've got a lot more people with permanent jobs in American politics. So, unlike Lyndon Johnson, Joe Biden didn't pretend that his goal was not to change the population. He said it out loud. During the campaign, Biden referred to  as a gift. Watch. 

t.  

It's a gift, says a man who has worked in a public job his entire life, who's never had a real job ever, is lecturing you about the economy and how it works as if he knows. By the way, in that tape, Joe Biden was so senile that his wife and his handlers gave him drugs before that interview. That interview that you just saw. So, that's the guy telling you about the economic benefits of illegal immigration. Now most, you're not supposed to notice that that conversation even took place. Just like you're not supposed to notice when the New York Times prints an op ed called ""We Can Replace Them,"" because that's a dangerous conspiracy theory. What are you, Alex Jones? No, we just watch carefully, not even that carefully. They say it constantly. The great replacement. Yeah. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's their electoral strategy and we know that because they see it all the time. Here's some examples.  

So, how is that a source of strength? He never explained. So, clearly it's the source of the Democratic Party's strength, they believe, though, actually their plan might not work out for them, since a lot of the people arriving may not be sympathetic to Joe Biden. Who possibly could be? But electoral politics are really secondary to the real concern, which is the stability of the country. So, the problem with what the Democratic Party is doing right now is not simply that it helps the Democratic Party, though we think that's bad. The problem is that they're doing it way too fast. This is too much change at once for any society ever, at any point in history. 

No society can metabolize this many new people and stay stable, especially not now in this specific moment, because two unprecedented waves of human migration, you have to add, let's see, , food shortages, skyrocketing housing prices, falling wages, the trauma of two and a half years of COVID, the manufactured racial strife you saw Joe Biden himself encouraging. You put all that together and you have the most volatile possible mix of social factors.

So, into that you throw millions of brand-new people who have no connection to America whatsoever, people who broke our laws to get here, who don't speak our language, who have no idea what the U.S. Constitution says and don't care and what do you have when you put all of that together? You have a recipe for social collapse.  

This is why no sane government would ever do this. The Chinese government would never consider doing this. Even corrupt, dumb governments that can't even keep a national airline flying would never do something like this to their own countries because they all want their own countries to collapse and it's not an attack on the people coming here, by the way, some of whom are legitimately great people and want to be here for the right reasons. The problem is the volume. No country can withstand what we're going through right now and in our specific case, it turns out that a lot of the people coming are not ready to participate in a democracy. A huge percentage of the migrants crossing the border today are functionally illiterate. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, ""41% of immigrants score at or below the lowest level of English literacy, a level variously described as below basic or functionally illiterate."" 

Now add to this the problems that American-born people are having with English after two years of COVID and suspended education and a life spent staring into a screen. What does that look like? A lot of people who are moving here, are not becoming assimilated and we know that because many haven't learned English after living here for years. The same study found that 67% of Hispanic immigrants do not develop English proficiency even after 15 years of living in United States. That means around 5 million migrants became citizens without even being able to speak our language.  

Once again, not an attack on them, an attack on the people running the country. This could capsize the United States. This is a huge, sprawling country with a massive population. So, the question from day one has always been, what holds everyone together? What is the one thing we all have in common? It's not an ethnic group. It's not a shared history. Now it's not a language. So, what is it? 

Well, in the absence of glue, things break apart. That's a physic principle. So, no one who cared about the future of this country would do this to the country. It is truly insanity and yet the Biden administration is trying to make it worse, working hard to make it worse. Fox News is reporting tonight that the administration awarded $172 million grant to a George Soros-linked organization which exists to ""help young border crossers avoid deportation."" 

Now, why is some foreign-born billionaire allowed to change our country fundamentally? That's the big question. Here are the specifics. This organization is called the Vera Institute for Justice, and it stands to gain a billion dollars in federal money by the end of the contract just to subvert our laws. Now, the catch is that no one verifies whether the people crossing the border are actually minors. You can't know who they are. By definition, they're here illegally and after 9/11, didn't we care about the authenticity of documents? Didn't we have a Real I.D. Act?  

Well, we don't know how old they are and that's how 24-year-old Medina Ulloa was able to enter this country and murder a father of four in the backyard of his house in Florida in October. He posed as a child so that Joe Biden would fight him at your expense to Jacksonville in the middle of the night. So, courtesy of the Biden administration, unaccompanied minors like Medina Ulloa are also arriving in New York and Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Arizona and many other places. According, for example, to 12 News in Phoenix representatives for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport reported that hundreds of migrants showed up recently with no booked tickets. Roughly 3 to 400 refugees have arrived every single day by bus in recent months. So why are all of these illegal aliens arriving in Phoenix?  

Well, many of them are dropped off by a nonprofit called RCBH, which brags it's helped nearly 20,000 illegal aliens released by immigration authorities without charges moving all over the country and that's where it's happening, all over the country. In Brownsville, Texas, Fox News observed busses contracted by the Biden administration dropping off dozens of male migrants at a parking garage.  

Our reporters witnessed those migrants go into an unmarked office. They get picked up by taxicabs and driven to the airport. None of them were children. Commercial airline pilots right now are being told to fly these people all over the country. We spoke to a pilot who's doing it every day and we're quoting, ""We are breaking the law, transporting illegals, many of whom are unaccompanied minors."" 

Why is this continuing? Because neither party is interested in stopping it. On this question, as on foreign policy, there's only one party, the uni-party, and its aligned against your most basic interests no matter what color you are, by the way. Instead, both parties are finding new ways to give American jobs to foreign-born applicants; 62 Republicans just joined, to their eternal shame, with almost every single Democrat in the House to pass the national defense bill. Now tucked away in that $840 billion piece of legislation, is a plan to give away even more American jobs to foreign workers as if we need this now.  

So, now the children of H-1B visa workers will receive citizenship because their parents took jobs in this country. Oh, how does that work, exactly? ""Shut up, racist."" Again, it's not about race. It's about economics and social cohesion, both of which they're destroying. Now, according to our Congress, fewer jobs for Americans somehow makes this country safer. That's been their plan since 1965 and since 1965 both parties have supported it.

In one of the most dramatic press conferences in recent history, the sitting president of the United States announced today that he has cancer. Now, traditionally, it's the job of the White House physician to update the public on significant changes to the president's health, but in a striking and honestly poignant break with protocol, Joe Biden decided to drop the bracing news himself. Here he is:

I have cancer, Joe Biden said, and I got it from growing up in Delaware. And with that, Biden left the stage, taking no questions about his condition. What kind of cancer does Joe Biden have? What is his long-term prognosis and is Delaware really that bad? Parts of it are not beautiful. That is true, but can an entire state be a carcinogen? At this point, we can't say.  

We are hearing word tonight that Biden may have misspoken and rattled no doubt by the stress of his diagnosis. It is likely that, in fact, it's not cancer Joe Biden is battling, but dementia. Simple mistake. We'll get an update from our own in-house physician, Dr. Marc Siegel, in just a moment. But first, no matter what is wrong with Joe Biden, something clearly is, it has not prevented him from working to amass more power than any American president has ever had.  

Joe Biden approaches power the way J.B. Pritzker approaches the waffle station at a Shoney's breakfast bar, with maximum enthusiasm. He snorts and slurps and splashes it on his shirt. He can't get enough. Joe Biden's latest idea is that he personally is the only branch of government in the United States. No more separation of powers. Joe Biden has all the power. If the Congress, the Supreme Court does something that Joe Biden doesn't like, he gets to simply ignore it and then do what he wants to do and he can do this because it's an emergency.  

There's no time for democracy. We've got an emergency on our hands and naturally, only Joe Biden can solve it. We don't have enough abortions. It's an emergency. You're not wearing a mask alone in your car. It's an emergency. Your kids aren't trans yet. It's an emergency and of course, the emergency to top all emergencies, the climate crisis, which is a kind of ongoing thousand-year emergency, and for that reason, very much existential, whatever that means, but trust us, it is bad and the only solution to it is to hand Joe Biden more power. 

At an event today, Biden explained the details. Since Congress has officially rejected his attempt to take over our country's energy grid and plunge America into well-deserved darkness, Joe Biden will have to do it himself unilaterally. Now, how is that constitutional, may I ask? Come on. You know the answer, ""because it's an emergency, dummy."" 

It turns out that because Congress rejected Joe Biden's bill and also because Fox News exists, Americans are dying by the millions from bad weather, which apparently this planet has never seen before, because actually the glaciers were not real. They never happened. That's an Alex Jones thing. What is real is existential climate change. Thankfully, Joe Biden is going to save you from it. Watch. 

Now, he slurred the words maybe because, as we told you, he has cancer, but if you listen carefully, you heard today that because of climate change for the first time in history, it's going to be hot and then it's going to rain hard. 

You did that, Republicans, with your two stroke chainsaws and your damn Ford F-150. Shame, shame, shame. It's like you didn't know it was going to happen. It's not like you weren't warned. Back in 1989, a senior official at the United Nations told the world that ""entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000."" So, you knew when you did it, when you got your Suburban. Look what happened now. Those were once thriving beach towns. Now they're dive sites. People are snorkeling over Malibu, looking down at Prince Harry's house. Here's one of Barack Obama's beachfront compounds. As you can see, it's now underwater.

But wait, it's not underwater. Actually, it's fine and Obama knew it would be fine. In fact, Obama spent more than $10 million to buy it and that tells you how much he believes in global warming. Not at all, it turns out.  

Actually, no one really believes in global warming and that's why all the liberals in the United States live on the coasts, because they don't believe it. That's why many of them fly private, because the entire theory is absurd and they know it. 

So, be more like a dog. Ignore what they say. Watch what they do. Watch the real estate they buy. See if you can find Al Gore flying commercial ever. You can't because the whole thing is a joke, but that doesn't mean it can't hurt people. Oh, it definitely can and it definitely has. Gasoline is now unaffordable for millions of Americans. That's a life destroyer. That affects everything in the country. 

When the price of fossil fuels rise, so does the price of everything else. That's a life destroyer and it's not accidental. The administration did this on purpose, and now they're gloating about it. They're rubbing it in your face. Can't afford to drive your truck anymore?"", sneers our transportation secretary Mayor Pete,"" Then it looks like you're going to have to buy a little electric car. Sorry. 

Electric vehicles? So, what is an electric vehicle? What do those little electric cars have to do with climate change? Well, that's a good question. Turns out there is a connection. . Oh, did you know that? Did you know that you can't charge an electric car with a wind farm? How do you charge them? You charge them with fossil fuels. That's also how you build them – with fossil fuels. It's pretty funny. 

Last month, a GM spokesperson, along with an executive from a Michigan utility, kind of let the secret out. Watch this.  

  

Someday, let's hope historians find that tape and then just savor it, get a beer, get a whole six pack and watch it again and again and again. The spokes chick from the car company was asked, ""Impressed by your battery, but how do you charge it?"" She goes ""from the building. Charge comes from the building. You just plug it into the socket."" But where does the electricity come from?  

She has no idea. ""We have a battery. There is a battery in here. It's a battery."" So, then they ask the utility guy, where's electricity come from? Oh, from a coal plant. So, you charge your little electric car that Mayor Pete wants you to buy with coal, and then you feel virtuous. 

So, really, if you think about it, it's no wonder they tell you that the science is settled and you're a denier, you're immoral if you have questions because there's really no defending the details, most of which, as you just saw, they don't understand. How does the electric car get charged? Oh, from the building, which is not a power plant, for the record. It's just a building with an outlet.

So today, Joe Biden didn't answer any questions about where the energy is coming from. In fact, he told us there's no time for debate because it's an emergency.  

""Let me slur it again. Sorry, I've got cancer. Code red for humanity.""

And actually, he's right, but not in the way that he intends. If Biden and other leaders throughout the West, not just elected ones, but the NGO community, continue to do what they've done for the past 20 years and suppress fossil fuels, it will be a code red disaster. Millions of people will starve to death. Billions of people will drop into poverty. Unlike rising oceans, that effect is guaranteed,.

But Joe Biden doesn't care, assuming he knows. He's not going to be here for that anyway. His new executive order will spend more than $2 billion on wind power in the Gulf of Mexico. How much energy does a windmill produce? No, not how much can it produce, how much does it produce and where does it go? Just for fun, if you have a day free, try to get an answer to that question. You can't. No one asks. No one cares.  

Biden is also ordering the Secretary of the Interior to ""advance clean energy development all over the country,"" which means pay off his donors, of course. That means more electric cars, solar panels, etc., etc.. So, who benefits from this? That's always the first question. Well, of course, Democratic donors benefit. They're getting rich from this, but who makes all this stuff? Well, China makes almost all of it. China makes 76% of the world's lithium-ion batteries. China makes 75% of the world's solar panels. China makes virtually all of the world's wind turbines. Seven of the world's ten biggest wind turbine manufacturers are based in China.

So that means China will have control of our energy grid. If you control a country's energy grid, you control that country. It's really simple. On CBS recently, Joe Biden's energy coordinator, Amos Hochstein, explained why that's a good thing.  

Look at that little sleazeball. Oh, yeah. Got to hand China control of our energy grid, the biggest, the most efficient in the world, the country with the world's largest recoverable oil reserves – that would be the United States of America. But we can't use any of that. We have to give China control of our energy, which is to say, of our country, of our economy. The world is making investments, so we're being left behind.  

Okay. Well, the rest of the world has gone deeper into the Green Delusion than we have, none of which helps the actual environment, by the way, in case you care about nature. Nature is not helped by any of this. But the rest of the world has been a lot more eager than the United States to dive right into the Green New Deal. So, how has that worked for them? We can't say this enough. It has been an unqualified disaster.  

In the first quarter of this year, just a few years after the Berlin Senate declared a climate emergency, so-called renewables accounted for 50% of all German electricity consumption. So, what happened next? Well, Germany can't keep the lights on and is very worried about winter coming.  

As The Washington Post put it, ""Hamburg landlords are rationing hot water. Berlin may turn off nonessential traffic lights at night."" Oh, no traffic lights. Oh, that's a civilized country. How's that working for you? In Great Britain, no country has ever evaporated faster in world history than that one, but in the U.K., more than 90% of the population lives in a place where local authorities have just declared a climate emergency. 

Now they have more urgent emergencies, it turns out, actual emergencies, back here in the physical, not theoretical world where we need, like traffic lights and power that comes out of the outlet. There are real emergencies. In April, the British government announced that the number of households in the UK living in ""fuel poverty"" now stands at 5 million.

Oh, this isn't wartime rationing. The blitz is over. This is right now in 2022. How about Argentina? In 2019, Argentina's government declared a climate emergency, even though, unlike China or India, it's not really contributing to global carbon emissions. Argentina produces about 1% of global carbon emissions. But they did it anyway because it seemed like the fashionable thing to do, plus ESG. ""We're modern. We're against climate."" 

Well, today, what happened? Argentina is experiencing, well, there's no other way to put it, collapse. The collapse was not caused by a half-degree rise in average temperatures in the non-Patagonian continental area. No, it was caused by what is always caused by: spiking energy costs which cause inflation. Inflation is now over 60% in Argentina. Argentina is now too broke to function. 

""Access to fertilizers and diesel is urgent to avoid complete paralysis,"" a farmers group in Argentina wrote to the government recently. Wait, farmers don't have access to fertilizers? What? How can you grow things without fertilizer? Well, fertilizer isn't , and we've got a climate emergency, so no fertilizer for you. Oh, except that means no food and then people starve. That happened in Sri Lanka, as we've told you repeatedly. We can't say this enough. In Sri Lanka, the government banned all fertilizers. As a result, food prices are up by 80%. In a poor country, that's not a small thing. Again, people starve.  

Has John Kerry contributing to the food bank in Sri Lanka? No, of course not. He's bombing often his own plane to another global warming conference. How about the Netherlands? A rich country, the world's second largest ag exporter in the name of climate, in 2019, the European Parliament declared a—wait for it—climate emergency in the Netherlands.  

So, the government forced farmers there to cut livestock by 50% because cow flatulence...Sandy Cortez has actually done a TikTok on this, I think. Cow flatulence, huge problem. So, we need what the EU called an unavoidable transition. What happened then? Oh, riots. Our leaders are telling us we need the same thing here.

It's a climate emergency. It's code red. You have no choice and they mean it and you don't get to vote on an either because they're so for democracy that they're going to force it down your throat with no vote at all. What happens next? Well, poverty, chaos, and then the lights go out.

Good evening and welcome to ""."" We're still shocked. Everyone else seems to have moved on to the next thing, but we still can't get over what we saw yesterday when Joe Biden stunned the world and announced during a press conference with no warning at all that he has a potentially fatal disease. ""I have cancer, ""Joe Biden said. ""I got it from living in Delaware."" 

It turns out that Joe Biden's home state is so thoroughly polluted, so supernaturally filthy, that even lepers living in public sewers in Calcutta refuse to go there. It's too unclean. How dirty is Delaware? It is so dirty, Joe Biden said, that when it rains, it rains oil. That's why everyone in Delaware gets cancer. They get it from the oil rain. Now, Joe Biden has it, too. 

Looking back, voters probably should have known a little more about Joe Biden's Delaware-related risk factors before he became president. It's too late now and it just got worse. Not only is Biden sick from Delaware oil rain, now he's got COVID. The White House announced it today. So, it's been a tough week, overall. Wednesday, it was cancer. Thursday, it was the coronavirus. Tomorrow, you've got to think it's going to be monkeypox. If you or someone you know has recently had unsafe sex with Joe Biden, please seek precautionary medical attention. God knows what you might have picked up.  

At the White House, they are genuinely upset by today's news, not because they're worried about Joe Biden's health. Everybody who works at the White House already knows he's so thoroughly unwell he can barely speak. These are the people who run his teleprompter. They're the ones who put the little pieces of tape on the floor so he knows where the door is.  

These are not people who have any illusions at all about Joe Biden's condition. What they're upset about is the fact that Joe Biden just stepped on their message and from day one, that message has been consistent and unrelenting: ""Get the vaccine or else."" Get the vaccine or you can't have a job or an organ transplant or Thanksgiving with your kids. Get the vax or you can't visit your mom as she dies in the hospital. Get the vax, prole. It's the most important thing that you can do and you're a monster if you don't.  

So, people obey. They did it. ""Okay,"" they said, ""We'll take the vax. It doesn't look like we have a choice, but are you sure it works? It's pretty hard to make a successful vaccine against a coronavirus. In fact, nobody's ever done it. We tried with SARs almost 20 years ago and that failed completely, so you are absolutely positive this stuff works? Are you sure it's safe and effective?"" 

""Of course we're positive,"" screamed the mannequin. We're the U.S. government. We know these things. We don't make mistakes. Stop asking questions. Questions have no place in science. Just take this shot and you will not get COVID. That's guaranteed."" Joe Biden said that. He didn't just say it once. He said it many, many, many times. 

  

Yeah, there's no excuse. And if you don't get the vax, you're going to die from COVID. You're going to get COVID if you don't get the vax. Now, if you'd said that once or maybe like 11 times, you could say he's got dementia, whatever. He said it pretty much every day, and he's not the only one. They all did, beginning with Lord Fauci.  

  

So, it turns out once you get vaccinated, you can feel safe. You're not going to get infected. You're not like the dirty people who didn't get the vax, the anti-science people who are all going to die, and when they do, we're going to laugh at them because they deserve it. And by the way, it wasn't just Biden who's just reading the script. It wasn't just Fauci who will say whatever it takes and is, of course, covering up his own role in creating the virus in the first place. Even actual doctors, even the head of the CDC, even Rochelle Walensky herself, said the same thing.  

Yeah, it's not just in the clinical trials. It's in real world data. Just look around observed reality. You don't know anyone who's gotten the vaccine and then got COV-- oh, wait, everybody who got the vaccine got COVID. How does that work? Well, they never explained. They stopped telling you it was a pandemic of the vaccine because it was so obviously untrue. 

You got the vaccine, you still got COVID, so they stopped saying anything at all, and they hoped you would forget about what they said for a full year and all the thousands of people whose lives they destroyed on the basis of that lie, but what they didn't do ever was apologize for it. They hope they wouldn't have to. But then last Friday, Joe Biden, again the president of the United States, became visibly symptomatic with something during a speech in Jerusalem. Watch.  

Remember, when you're a kid, all the public health authorities try to stamp out cigarette smoking, and they printed these huge posters of up a wino dying of cirrhosis, tugging on a Pall Mall. They said smoking is very glamorous. In other words, don't be this guy. Well, if we ever have another pandemic, let's hope we don't, but if we ever do, play that tape. That's what you don't do. Remember, the CDC in its guidance, when you develop symptoms, you isolate immediately.  

You don't cough on people at press conferences. Those are the rules that your kids lived by at school. That's why they wore the little masks. They couldn't breathe. Your children were also told to scan QR codes for contact tracing purposes if they ever developed COVID a dry cough, but today, Joe Biden gets COVID, and when reporters asked how he got it and why he didn't isolate after getting symptoms, the response the White House press secretary was and we're quoting here, and we're quoting her, ""I don't think that matters."" It just doesn't matter. Turns out it doesn't matter. Go ahead and super spread if you want to.  

So, if you're on Air Force One yesterday or you went to a big press conference in Massachusetts or if you were the recipient of a fist bump in Saudi Arabia, you may have the Rona, but nobody cares. I don't think it matters, says Karine Jean-Pierre, the president's glass ceiling shattering publicist. So, obviously they're hypocrites. Did you know that? Had you heard that before? Well, now you can mark that down as confirmed. That's only part of the story and we don't want to ignore the fact that the real story is the president of the United States is 79-years-old and has a, how to put it, complicated medical history and now he's got COVID.  

So, what does that mean? Well, sincerely, we hope he's going to be okay. We do know he's going to lose his sense of smell, maybe forever. What does that mean? No more sniffing little girls. If you're Joe Biden and your main source of pleasure at this late stage in your life is sniffing the hair of unsuspecting, defenseless little girls and now you can't even smell it, imagine that. Let's say you're riding your bike and you see a little girl and you think ""I'd love to sniff her hair. Oh, man. No sense of smell."" 

So, actually the costs of COVID are a little more profound than sometimes we understand. What's kind of weird from a political perspective is that Biden got infected with COVID at exactly the moment his approval rating has reached its lowest ebb, not just with normal people, with Democrats. He's 19% among Hispanic voters. Red alert, anyone and this also comes exactly the same moment that his son faces possible felony charges, huh? And also, needless to say, at the moment that his dementia has become so obvious that no one can possibly deny it.  

I'm in Israel to honor the Holocaust, he just said. Oh, it's so awful. So, what does this mean? Well, this incites the blood instincts of others in his party. Gretchen Whitmer, probably sitting in her rec room right now polishing her resume. ""I could replace him,"" but the real story here is the medical story. Joe Biden and a whole lot other people have gotten pretty sick with COVID after getting multiple shots. What is that about exactly? How did that happen? It's easy to just mock that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That's clearly untrue, but is there a connection between getting most multiple COVID vaccine shots and getting sicker?  

Is it possible that the vaccine actually can hurt you, especially if you keep getting boosted? Can it weaken your immune system? Well, that looks possible. Multiple studies have looked into this. Just last month, the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published the findings of several MRNA researchers and we're quoting, ""In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type one interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health.""  

Well, that seems like a headline. Did you read that in The New York Times? No, you probably didn't. Kind of weird since hundreds of millions of people got the shot. The researchers continue that in their studies of the COVID vaccine, ""We identify potential profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These disturbances potentially have a causal link to neurodegenerative disease... myocarditis, Bell's Palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response, etc."" 

So, it's possible. In fact, it's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system. This fact, the authors concluded, will ""have a wide range of consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections."" Now again, we sincerely hope that's not true, but it's not just the conclusion of one scientific journal.  

The Lancet may be the most famous scientific journal in the world, released similar findings in February. The Lancet's piece was entitled ""Risk of infection, hospitalization and death up to nine months after a second dose of COVID 19 vaccine."" A physician called Kenji Yamamoto made this observation about the data from The Lancet. He wrote this in a letter to the Journal of Virology and we're quoting ""The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses of COVID 19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals."" 

Now your first response, if you're a humane person to a line like that, has got to be deep sympathy because people were misled. They were forced. They were forced, medical ethics thrown out the window. People were forced to take medicine they didn't want and some of them have been hurt by it and you don't have to take this man's word for it. Pull up the Lancet study yourself. You won't find anything of the text of the article saying what Kenji Yamamoto said, which is weird. Why would the Lancet want to hide a major finding like that? We can't say, but if you look at table three in the piece, here's what you'll find buried in the data. 

Among people around the age of 80 who have been double vaccinated, that would include people like Joe Biden, the per capita rate of medical incidences, including hospitalizations for death, is nearly twice as high as the rate of serious incidence for the unvaccinated. This is 180 days after vaccination. What is that and why is no one interested? The piece also includes a chart showing negative vaccine efficacy for all ages after eight months for all participants in the study. So again, this is sad news for a lot of Americans, but it's also a profound indictment, maybe the greatest indictment in our lifetimes of our leaders, their recklessness, their pig headedness, their dishonesty. 

Given this, how is the D.C. government, among many others, still requiring schoolchildren, public and private schoolchildren, to get a COVID vaccine? That's a question that no one asked at today's White House press briefing. How are members of the U.S. military being dismissed without their pensions because they won't take this same vaccine, in light of these study results. Is no one paying attention? How is this allowed? But instead, today at the White House briefing, all the questions are about the proof of life video that Joe Biden's office released today. Here it is.  

  

Here's a question. Is there a single public statement Joe Biden has made since Inauguration Day that he did not read off a teleprompter? Is there one? Find it. 

So, the question they come up at today's press briefing was, after seeing that is who shot that footage? Is that person in danger?  

Well, once again, the president's glass ceiling shattering publicist, Karine Jean-Pierre, was asked that question and she said it's totally fine because the video was taken outside and there's no risk outside that we will arrest you for paddleboarding in California. But then an hour earlier, to make this even messier because it's inherently messy, because it's Biden-related, the White House released this picture and it shows Joe Biden, brace yourselves, indoors at his desk, no mask. 

So, who shot that picture? Is that person still alive? Does that person have monkeypox? Presumably, the White House photographer is vaccinated. That's got to be a requirement working there. But as we just saw, that may make the photographer more vulnerable to infection and in fact, and we hate to say this, it might mean the photographer is now more likely to face serious health complications.  

So, underlying all of this is a really ominous fact, and that is a lot of people have been hurt by this. You hate to say it. Germany's Ministry of Health found that 1 in 5,000 Germans have suffered ""serious side effects after a COVID 19 vaccine."" 

  

Now, one in 5,000 may seem like a lot or a little, but extrapolate forward to the United States, a country with our population. That would mean that in the U.S., if that number holds constant across countries (and why wouldn't it?) it would mean more than 100,000 Americans may have been seriously injured by the COVID vaccine. 

Why does no one talk about them? Why does nobody care and what happens to them now? If Joe Biden accomplishes a single thing as president, it will be getting more people to ask that question today and it's a fair question and to end, science is about questions. Science is questioning. So, anyone who tells you, you're anti-science for asking a question doesn't understand what science is.

701	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-bannon-found-guilty-crime-democrats-never-convicted	2022-07-22 22:57:00	Tucker Carlson: Bannon found guilty of a crime Democrats are never convicted of | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to Steve Bannon's conviction and voices his concerns over the practices of the January 6 committee on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The hallmark of any authoritarian regime is politicized justice. Under that system, your opponents go to jail, your supporters can do whatever they want and this reveals that the state exists not to serve the people who live in it, but to preserve itself and to crush all dissent. Hate to think we've reached a point anywhere near that here in the United States because there's nothing worse than that or scarier or harder to fix, but in fact, we have reached that point. That's where we are. 

Yesterday, for example, a man leaped on stage at a campaign event and tried to stab Lee Zeldin. Zeldin is sitting member of Congress. He's challenging the unelected incumbent, Kathy Hochul, in the governor's race in New York. 

So ordinarily, attempting to assassinate a federal officeholder would be considered a big deal. But Lee Zeldin is a Republican, so it's not a big deal anymore. The man who tried to murder Lee Zeldin was released immediately with no bail. Less than 24 hours later, by contrast, former Trump adviser  that until recently were not crimes at all, for which he now faces a prison term of two years. Bannon has been declared guilty of something called contempt of Congress. That may strike you as an unintentionally hilarious term, since most of the time Congress invites our contempt. But the point is, this is a crime the Democrats are not convicted of ever.  

Attorney General Eric Holder and IRS executive Lois Lerner were once found to be in contempt of Congress, both of them, and for real crimes. In Holder's case, it was gunrunning in Mexico. In Lerner's case, it was targeting conservatives for audits, but neither one went to trial. Holder claimed executive privilege, which was enough, even after a judge ruled that executive privilege did not apply in Eric Holder's case, but it didn't matter. He walked. Lois Lerner cited the Fifth Amendment. It was as simple as that. Both of them, today, Lerner and Holder are free and richer than ever, but these standards do not apply to Steve Bannon.  

Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by the January 6 committee despite the fact he had literally nothing to do with January 6. We know that because he left the White House three years before it happened, but it didn't matter. He annoyed the wrong people, so he's going to jail. Now, this shouldn't surprise you, really, because we've been building toward this moment for some time. You might recall Greg Craig, that would be Barack Obama's former White House counsel. He was acquitted of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA. Back in 2019, he'd been working for Ukraine. Now at almost exactly the same moment. Paul Manafort, who hired Greg Craig to work on Ukraine, was convicted of violating the same law, FARA, on the same account for Ukraine. How does that work exactly?  

It seems like a double standard and indeed it is a double standard. But it's a consistent standard. We've seen it again and again and again. Former Clinton attorney Michael Sussmann was just acquitted by a D.C. jury of lying to the FBI. That happened in May. The theory was that really who knows what Michael Sussmann told the FBI about nonexistent Russian servers in Trump Tower. Okay. As long as you're using that theory, does it work for everyone? Well, it didn't work for George Papadopoulos, didn't work for Michael Flynn. On the other hand, neither one of those guys had a key card to FBI headquarters like Michael Sussmann did and that came in handy, that relationship.

But Mike Flynn didn't have that relationship. His life was destroyed. Why? Because of handwritten notes by Peter Strzok, you can now see on MSNBC about their conversation in the White House about Russian sanctions. ""Get him to lie,"" the head of counterintelligence of the FBI wrote to Strzok, speaking of Flynn.  

So, on the basis of that, the setup, they hounded Mike Flynn into poverty. The same thing happened to George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos' crime? Not being as forthcoming as possible about his job status with the Trump campaign, unpaid. That's what the DOJ told the court in a filing, ""The defendant did not provide substantial assistance."" Oh, that's the standard. So, Papadopoulos went to prison, so did the 69-year-old grandmother recently call Pam Hemphill. She's currently serving a two month sentence in federal prison. Why? Because she, ""paraded in the Capitol on January 6,"" didn't hurt anyone. She's got breast cancer. She's going to prison. 

A judge in Washington had no problem issuing that sentence at exactly the same moment the U.S. attorney for D.C. dropped all charges against Stephen Colbert's production crew for doing the same thing, but worse. So, Stephen Colbert's team may have lied to federal authorities when they said they'd stay out of restricted areas. But they didn't lie to federal authorities in quite the same way, apparently and of course, they had the right politics, unlike Roger Stone. 

Roger Stone got a three-year prison sentence. He had a SWAT team show up at his house at dawn with a CNN crew in tow tipped off by the Justice Department for maximum humiliation. What was his crime? No one can remember because there wasn't one. So, if you've been paying any attention at all to our justice system, particularly under Merrick Garland, you had some sense of where this was going. It was moving toward the authoritarian system we now have where justice is an illusion. Offend the people in charge, get punished. Support the people in charge, do whatever you want.  

Still, even knowing that today's conviction of Steve Bannon is an escalation. There was not even a pretense in his trial that the prosecution of Steve Bannon was lawful. So, the Constitution requires equal protection. Heard that phrase? That means that selective prosecution is not allowed. It's unconstitutional. If you don't try one person for a crime, you don't get to charge another person for the same crime because that's selective. It's political, but under Merrick Garland, that's the new rule. Offend us, go to jail. At his trial, Steve Bannon was not permitted to say that his attorneys had counseled him against bending the knee of the January 6 Committee. He couldn't even say that. Nor was he allowed to argue the subpoena was legally invalid. 

Why couldn't he argue that? All Steve Bannon was allowed to do was shut up. He had to remain silent and await his conviction and that's what he did. Outside a federal court today, Steve Bannon pointed out that he subpoenaed members of the January 6 Committee to testify at his trial. Why can't you face your accusers? Isn't that guaranteed under our system? Not in this case because having the January 6 Committee members show up would expose them to the one thing they cannot tolerate, which is cross-examination. So, they refused. Watch. 

Did you expect Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger to show up? They don't have to testify. They never do anything they don't want to do. They can just send their enemies to jail. 

So, their behavior is really not that surprising because the January 6 committee itself does not allow cross-examination during its hearings. You may have noticed this. It doesn't even allow the identification of many witnesses. They do it anonymously. How do you define show trial? That's how you define show trial. So, these are not hearings in any recognizable sense. This is a show trial. That is exactly what it is. That's not overstatement. 

The committee did not allow the cross-examination of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for example. Even after she made claims that were insane, they made no sense. She claimed that Donald Trump tried to carjack his own presidential limo and drive it to the Capitol.  

So, if she'd been cross-examined – which in any hearing is permitted under the Western system of justice, not the woke system of justice that Liz Cheney has brought us, but her the conventional system that all of us grew up with –  you would have a cross-examination and someone might have pointed out that the Secret Service agents in that limo denied her account. But if you were watching on MSNBC or CNN, which have taken this propaganda live and then bragged about it, ""We're doing the bidding of the state. We're so proud. We're calling it journalism"" we've refused to do that because we have dignity and we're not liars, unlike them, but if you're watching us on those channels, you have no idea that the Secret Service denied this account. 

The Secret Service was never contacted by Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger before the testimony and that's bizarre because if the committee wanted to get to the truth of the Trump grabbed the wheel of the limo allegation, they would have talked to people who were there, but they didn't. Republicans, if they'd been allowed to cross-examine, if they demanded to cross-examine (We're not defending Republicans. They've fallen down on the job. That's an understatement.)

But if someone had been allowed to ask adult questions of the witness, we might have learned what CNN viewers will never know and that's that Hutchinson reportedly tried to get a job at Mar-a-Lago afterward, but none of that was allowed because it's pure propaganda. It's been going on for months now.

Last night, the January 6 committee put on testimony from an anonymous official (Can you imagine, an anonymous official?) claiming that Secret Service agents assigned to Mike Pence were using their radios to tell their families goodbye like they're on the deck of the Titanic because they assumed they would die in the Capitol because some guy in Viking horns on mushrooms was spinning and round in circles and talking about peace. They were so afraid. Watch this nonsense.  

It's just absolutely shameful, absolutely shameful, that the other channels played this c--- without pushing back in even the mildest way. ""Oh, it's news."" It's not news and your job in journalism is to hold the powerful accountable. It's not to do their bidding or put their lives on TV unedited in primetime, which is what every other channel has done except Fox News and we are proud of that. ""Well, you should be ashamed."" Yeah, you should be ashamed.

But there was no cross-examination allowed in any of this because this committee would not allow it, no rebuttal of any kind.  So, course, there was no inquiry as to why a Capitol Hill police officer with a documented history of recklessly mishandling firearms shot an unarmed woman in the neck, an Air Force veteran. He shot her in the neck. Why? You're not allowed to ask. 

What happened to those thousands of hours of surveillance footage? Why can't we see those? You're not allowed even to ask why we're not allowed to see them. We can't know why police are on video letting people into the Capitol complex on January 6. Why is that? Not allowed to ask. And this is going to continue. As Adam Kinzinger said, this charade, which really does corrode the heart of our system, this will continue all the way until the midterms because as Kinzinger, who's dumb enough to see the quiet part out loud, admitted this is a political exercise. Watch. 

  

Yeah. Okay. We're getting to the bottom of this. Actually, you're preventing legitimate, obvious questions from being asked. And just in point of fact, no matter how long these hearings go on, they could go on forever and Adam Kinzinger will still be a sad, tormented, tiny man with a miserable personal life. So, you know, that's some comfort, but the prosecutors here working for Kinzinger and Cheney and the rest of this committee, just like the school boards and the teachers unions last year, worked in tandem with the Justice Department to punish the enemies of the Democratic Party. What is that? Well, it's the single greatest threat to the rule of law in the history of United States. That's true.

Happy Monday – trying to stay cheerful in the face of everything that's happening to the country. We talk about it every night, multiple disasters all at once, but if you had to isolate one single tragedy that's produced the highest casualty rate in the United States, you'll probably have to be the opioid crisis.  

Over the past 25 years, opioids have destroyed entire regions of the country, mostly rural areas, places populated by the people who built and fed this country for generations. Hundreds of thousands of them have died from opioid, and they're still dying, more than 100,000 drug ODs just last year, mostly from fentanyl.  and smuggled through Mexico. If you live here, you probably know someone who's died from fentanyl, probably someone's child.  

What you may have forgotten in the face of all this sadness is that the . It didn't just happen one day because people in sparsely populated zip codes in Kentucky and Vermont and West Virginia suddenly felt sad and started taking dangerous drugs. No, this particular disaster was created by drug companies. That's true. Purdue Pharma kicked it off. They did so by aggressively marketing a narcotic called OxyContin. They sold it to doctors and doctors sold it to their patients on the false claim it was non-addictive. It was very addictive.  

What happened next? Well, drive through upstate New York sometime. You can see the human carnage. Ultimately, Purdue Pharma faced a barrage of lawsuits and then criminal charges. In the end, however, not a single executive from that or any other drug company ever went to jail. So, no one was ever really punished for all those deaths, hundreds of thousands of deaths. Well, for a brief moment, it seemed possible that somebody would be punished.  

No one remembers this, but during the Democratic primaries in 2019, Kamala Harris, of all people, described pharma executives as ""nothing more than some high-level dope dealers"" who ""should be held accountable."" Then a few months later, she went further than that. Harris suggested the drug companies were so evil they might produce a COVID vaccine that wound up hurting people.

""If Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not taking it,"" Harris said. And then other Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, then the governor of New York, said the very same thing, but here's the amazing part. The second Joe Biden took office, talk like that stopped immediately. 

Never has a tune changed faster. Kamala Harris, who just months before had called drug companies dope dealers, suddenly sounded like the chief marketing officer at Pfizer. At one point, Harris announced that volunteers would go ""door to door"" to promote Pfizer's products. Never in our history have federal officials touted a publicly held company more aggressively than the Biden administration touted Pfizer. As a result, Pfizer's stock price exploded. Its executives made billions. Gone was any suggestion that the drug companies might be capable of doing anything wrong, ever.  

Instead, the media and the Biden administration lauded pharma executives as moral heroes and some of their products are lifesaving. That is true, but the bigger truth we are now learning is more complicated than that. In just the past few weeks, serious, very serious questions have emerged about some of the most widely prescribed drugs in America, very much including the COVID vaccines, but we want to begin tonight with what in any normal period would be front-page news around the world. It turns out the entire premise behind the most commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs appears to be completely wrong.  

These drugs are known as SSRI. They're ubiquitous. Between 1991 and 2018, total SSRI prescriptions in the U.S. rose by more than 3,000%. The number of prescriptions for the most common SSRI hit 224 million last year, 224 million prescriptions in a country of 330 million people. In other words, you know, dozens of people who are taking SSRIs. You may be taking them right now. And yet for decades there have been strong indications that there is a problem with these drugs and the most obvious is this.  

Antidepressants are supposed to cure depression. That's why they're prescribed. And yet, over the same period that SSRI prescriptions have risen 3,000%. The suicide rate, that may be the most reliable , has not fallen in the United States. In fact, the suicide rate has jumped by 35%. That's a huge increase. That's a lot of dead people.

Now, drug makers admit that their products may be part of the reason for the increase in suicide. The makers of Prozac, for example, can see that young people who take that drug have an increased risk of suicide compared to those who took a placebo. 

Think about that for a second. A drug that's supposed to make you less sad may make it more likely that you will kill yourself. How is that allowed? Well, it's been allowed because virtually no one has said a word about it. One person who did say something about it a long time ago was the actor Tom Cruise, all the way back in 2005. He had a very famous appearance on ""The Today Show."" You may remember it. Here it is. 

So, Cruise said a few things. One, maybe you shouldn't trust the pharma companies and just hand your children whatever they're producing and hope for the best. Two, there's no such thing as a chemical imbalance in your brain that causes depression. He said that and three, these drugs mask the real problems. You're suffering for a real reason the drugs can't fix.

Provocative statements. How did the country respond to this? Well, everyone in the media agreed ""Tom Cruise is crazy. He's in a cult. Shut up."" A lot of people thought that. We may even have thought that, but then more information kept coming out that made Tom Cruise look a little less crazy. 

In 2015, researchers from the scientific journal BMJ found that, ""Some birth defects occur 2 to 3.5 times more frequently"" a lot more frequently, ""among the infants of women treated with (SSRIs) early in pregnancy."" Wow. That's a huge problem ignored. 

In the same journal in 2020, researchers found that ""post-SSRI sexual dysfunction is underrecognized and can be debilitating both psychologically and physically."" Well, that's kind of a problem, too. If it steals your sex drive, maybe it's stealing your soul. No, ignore it. Only cult members care.

Then last year, researchers in Sweden found that ""There may be an increased hazard of violent crime during SSRI medication in a small group of patients. It may exist across age groups and throughout treatment periods and it possibly persists for up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation."" 

So, even after you stop taking the drugs, you may be impotent, infertile, violent, but at least the drugs cure the chemical imbalance in your brain that causes your depression. That was the selling point. What a great piece of marketing. You've got a chemical imbalance in your brain. You need these drugs and so hundreds of millions of prescriptions every year for these drugs. Well, in what seemed like news to us, last week we learned that actually SSRIs don't cure a chemical imbalance in your brain.  

So, the acronym SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. The theory was, has been for 30 years, that depressed people have an imbalance of serotonin in their brains. They have a chemical imbalance. If you give them more serotonin, then they become less depressed and happy. They're less likely to kill themselves. Right, but it turns out that serotonin deficiencies are not the reason people get depressed. That's not just a guess. It's now officially science. This new finding comes from University College London just completed a long and huge study on the relationship between depression and serotonin. It was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.  

Here's what the lead author of that study, Joanna Moncrieff, said about the findings. ""I think we can safely say, after a vast amount of research conducted over several decades, there is no convincing evidence that depression is caused by serotonin abnormalities, particularly by lower levels or reduced activity of serotonin."" 

What? That was the whole premise of the drug, which virtually the entire American population was taking on their doctor's advice and by the way, the drug companies made billions off those drugs.  

So, first we were told that SSRIs would save lives. Now we learn they don't actually work as intended. In fact, the whole idea behind the drug was completely wrong. And yet, and here is the best part, people are ignoring this news and the drugs are still being prescribed. How can that happen in a country based on science? Well, as it turns out, and this is the real point, that happens all the time. 

On this channel just the other day, Tony Fauci, no less than Tony Fauci, admitted in public that actually we have no idea what effect the COVID vaccines might have on women's fertility on their menstrual cycles. Wait a second. Remember one suggestion that could get you bounced off of Twitter and Facebook is as a conspiracy theorist. Well, it turns out it's true. Here's Tony Fauci.  

Oh, we need to study it more. We need to study more. It's just like human fertility, reproducing the species, the most important event in most people's lives. We need to study it more. Oh, but it's too late. We just forced millions of women to take that drug. Sorry. 

So how did they release a vaccine and then make it mandatory when they didn't understand the long-term effects of the drug? That's a very good question. Here's Deborah Birx. She's the former White House COVID response director again on Fox News.  

What?... ""I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection."" Really, Deborah Birx? But somehow you forgot to mention that as people were being fired from their jobs for not taking this on the premise that if they took it, they would never be infected? When do you get criminally charged? Soon, we hope.

And then there's the effect of the COVID vaccines on the elderly, the population most at risk. According to the Lancet, no less than, vaccinated people around Joe Biden's age are 80% more likely to become sick after taking the COVID shot as compared to unvaccinated people. Wait what? 80% more likely to become sick after taking the shot was supposed to prevent them from getting sick. How was this not the banner headline? It's being ignored.  

Well, as one scientist wrote in the Journal of Virology, ""The study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals."" So, it's not just that your natural antibodies were more powerful than the vaccine. We've known that for a long time, though they lied about it. Turns out the vaccine appears to depress your immune system. This has massive implications, not just for COVID. There are all kinds of horrible diseases you can get with a suppressed immune system. 

The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology found the same thing. ""Vaccination induces a profound impairment in type one interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health."" 

What the hell. And yet these people are on TV blithely admitting, ""Oh, well, we should do more study on that"" after we forced it on the entire American population, on billions of people globally. And this might explain how Joe Biden got COVID after getting every available shot and telling us just a year ago that vaccines conferred total immunity.  

So, one of the response to this is great sadness, of course, because even people who didn't vote for Joe Biden believed his administration when they said this because they were acting in the name of science. People were afraid of COVID. In some cases, with great justification. Some people were at risk of dying from COVID and they reached out and accepted this drug on the promise told to them repeatedly that it would save them. And now you have Deborah Birx, ""So, I knew it didn't really work.""

So, the question is, why is no one being held accountable? Why is the party that promised to hold Big Pharma accountable ignoring this? They're not saying a single word about any of these lies from the pharmaceutical industry, which is making billions and there's more. There's more.  

It turns out that Alzheimer's drugs, the most widely prescribed Alzheimer's drugs, don't actually treat Alzheimer's. You know, it does Viagra. That appears to work because in 2022, nothing's too weird to be true. But that's not what they're prescribing. In 2014, in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia, researcher Jeffrey Cummings found a 99% failure rate of Alzheimer's treatments in the pipeline for production, but he suggested that further treatments would be more successful.

Well, how does that work? Because the new medications, Cummings wrote, would effectively target the proteins that form so-called sticky plaques in the brains of people who suffer from Alzheimer's.  

Just like a lack of serotonin was thought to cause depression, sticky plaques in the brain were thought to cause Alzheimer's. If you’re interested in the subject, you've definitely read that. So, these new drugs came out. They're very expensive. Did they work? No, they failed. Two new Alzheimer's drugs, one from the drug company Genentech, the huge biotech firm Genentech, the other from Biogen were supposed to target sticky plaques and they did, but here's what they didn't do, fix Alzheimer's. They did nothing to affect Alzheimer's. Incidentally, the FDA approved Biogen's drug despite a ten-zero vote from the FDA's own advisory committee to reject it. What? 

So, it turns out that the assumption about sticky plaque causing Alzheimer's is likely wrong, and the people running our public health establishment knew what was wrong, but ignored the fact it was wrong. And again, no one's being held accountable. The entire population, trusts the science. If you want to make people distrust the science and go to the witch doctor rather than the pediatrician to treat their kids flu, this is how you act. You lie and then you never admit it, apologize or hold the liars accountable.  

So, the claim that sticky plaques caused Alzheimer's originated in a 2006 paper in the journal Nature, and it was written by neuroscience professor Sylvain Lesné. Recently, a Vanderbilt University neuroscientist called Matthew Schrag took a closer look at that 2006 paper, so did Science magazine. What did they find? We're quoting, ""shockingly blatant, fraudulent data,"" according to Donna Wilcock, who works on Alzheimer's at the University of Kentucky. Elisabeth Bik, a molecular biologist for potent, reported that ""data might have been changed to fit a better hypothesis.""  

Holy smokes. So, how did the NIH, which is working with your money on your behalf to keep the nation healthy, how did they respond to this? Well, they awarded that same scientist a new grant to study Alzheimer's and the Democratic Party, Pharma's new best friends. Haven't said a word about it. Instead, they're finding new ways to send your cash to their donors. Here's a new trans admiral.  

So, whatever you think of the trans question, kids struggling with questions about gender identity, notice the first thing that person says, the salient point that person makes is that a drug can fix it. Really? More drugs.  

So the same people who had no clue what SSRIs did and then pushed them for decades, the same people who are making toddlers take the COVID shot despite the obvious risks and no data whatsoever to support giving it to toddlers, the same people who fasttracked useless Alzheimer's drugs to the elderly, are now telling you that kids with gender identity disorders must have more drugs. And the administration that promised to hold Big Pharma accountable cheers them on.  

Maybe at this point we should acknowledge that drugs are not the answer to every human problem. People are more than just a collection of chemicals that could be manipulated to produce a desired result. They're human beings. They have souls. If they're sad or sick or alienated from other people, it's just possible that Pfizer is not the solution.

Sometime in the last 10 years, the  stopped caring about the millions of American citizens who live in New York City. How do we know that? We know that from watching what happened to the city. Ignore what they say, watch what they do.  

So, shortly after Bill de Blasio became mayor in 2014, for example, a huge number of drug addicts and mental patients began living on the sidewalks. That's not good and it increased. Over time, there was a 65% increase in homelessness in New York City. The streets, not surprisingly, got visibly dirtier. The smell got much stronger. Been there this month? Public urination was decriminalized by Bill de Blasio and many people took advantage of their new freedoms and there was, of course, a lot more crime. 

After local politicians pledged to cut law enforcement by a billion dollars a year, many cops decided it wasn't worth enforcing the law. Too much risk, not enough reward. So, the number of police stops declined by more than 90%. So, what happened to burglaries? Oh, they jumped 40%. Car thefts by almost 70%. Shootings doubled.  

So, what would you like to live in a place like that? Well, for many in New York, life just became intolerable and a huge number of people simply left, not that anyone in the mayor's office seemed to notice their departure. Average New Yorkers noticed. They understood perfectly well that city government had no interest in their well-being.

But that did not mean that local politicians stopped caring. Oh, they cared more than ever. They just cared about different people. New York's political class shifted its focus from concern over citizens (that was their old constituency) to deep concern about  whom they considered the future. As the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams explained during his campaign, when a foreign national breaks federal law to come to New York, that person must be rewarded with lavish, publicly funded services. Watch. 

Yeah, exactly. Whatever you want—driver's licenses, publicly-funded sex changes, anything. Giving non-citizens, lawbreakers, whatever they want is the right thing to do, said Eric Adams, as the entire Upper East Side packed its bags to move to Palm Beach County. But illegal aliens must be catered to free transportation, translators, any language you want, health care, voting rights. 

There can be no limit to what we give to illegal aliens because they are good people and we are not. Muriel Bowser, the similarly incompetent Democratic mayor of Washington, DC, strongly agreed with this. Illegal aliens must get everything they asked for, she said, and some things they've never asked for, including the city's assistance, avoiding arrest for the crimes they've committed. Watch Muriel Bowser. 

Muriel Bowser meant it so sincerely that she hired people in leotards to stage interpretive dance to celebrate illegal aliens. All of this played out during the Trump administration. Sitting at home in seclusion in Delaware during the presidential campaign, Joe Biden was watching all of this mouth open as he ate his Jell-O, nodding vigorously. Every Democrat in the country seemed to agree with this. Illegal aliens are holy because diversity is our strength. 

  

They all know the line, except Joe Biden, who had to read it just to make sure he got it right. And by the way, how did our former president from Hawaii wind up with a southern accent? That is one mystery that was never solved after eight years in office, but whatever. Diversity is our strength.

And once he became president, Joe Biden promptly put that slogan into practice. How? By opening our borders to the world and of course, millions of people poured in. This was called the equity agenda. Now, for the country, this was tough and very destabilizing. Millions of brand-new people, many of whom who don't speak the language, almost none of whom have an American-level education, the largest human wave in our country's history at exactly the moment when the country can least afford it. 

So, it was tough, but naturally, many of these new arrivals gravitated to our biggest city, New York, because they were welcome there. They saw the new mayor and the old mayor, the mayor before that mayor all talking about how welcome they were in New York. So, they went there. What happened then? 

Well, that's interesting. Here's the new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, from last week. Now, watch this and see if you can detect a difference from the first Eric Adams’ clip we showed you about illegal aliens. Here he is.  

Wait a second. He's gone complaining about the cost of translation services, but 20 minutes ago, during his campaign, he was telling us we have to pay for translation services, but it turns out that functional states, the federal government, now has to pay for translation services and schools and shelters and a host of other costs because illegal aliens may be great in theory. We love them, but in practice, illegal aliens are expensive. Eric Adams just learned that. It turns out that importing millions of poor people doesn't actually make you richer.  

As you just heard Adams put it, this is a real burden on New Yorkers, the ones who are still there. Now, to be fair to Eric Adams, he's not the only subgenus who is having this realization tonight. Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C. is having it, too. Remember her plan to run a sanctuary city that's open to ""every immigrant?"" How's that going? Well, here's an update.  

Oh, they're being tricked to come to a city that invited them and promised them every conceivable service, including legal defense, against our own government for breaking our laws. They're being tricked. Ok, in other words, illegal aliens are our strength except when they actually show up. When they show up, it turns out they're dirty, dangerous and expensive. That sounds like classic White supremacy. And there's no reason these new non-Americans should have to put up with it for a second.  

Now, Democrats in New York been telling us for years that illegal aliens ought to be allowed to vote in our elections. OK, why don't they? Newly arrived Haitians and Salvadorans and everybody else who's here illegally should organize into a political bloc and bounce Eric Adams out of office. Here he is, attacking you like the racist he is. You don't have put up with it. Democrats have told us illegal aliens are as American as anyone who was born here. 

More American actually, says Joe Biden. Ok, it's time to act like it. Border jumpers should use democracy, the mechanics of our system that is now their system, to install an illegal alien mayor of New York who actually represents them. It's only fair. Let's hope it happens tomorrow.

But even if it does, it will not solve the bigger problem. The bigger problem is a lack of diversity.  are supposed to make America more diverse, but in practice they usually head to places that are already pretty diverse. Brooklyn, for example, is only 35% White. Pretty diverse. One place they almost never go is to towns where Democratic voters live. Strangely and you can check this if you want, it's on the internet, the party of diversity is led by people who strongly, overwhelmingly prefer all White neighborhoods for themselves and their families and that's just weird. No diversity for the diversity promoters. No, doubt it’s an oversight. They just haven't thought of it, but we can fix it. We can do this.  

There are an awful lot of Democratic donors in Aspen, Colorado, for example. It's an overwhelmingly blue place. It's also nearly all White. What do we do about this? Well, how about an airlift? We've done this before. The Berlin airlift, it was called. It lasted for 15 months from the summer of 1948 to the next fall. The U.S. Air Force delivered millions of tons of desperately needed supplies to the suffering people of West Germany.  

Nearly 80 years later, the Berlin airlift is still considered one of the great humanitarian acts in our history. But there's no reason we couldn't repeat it. Think big. Imagine an Aspen airlift, a national effort to rescue the people of Aspen from the suffocating prison of their own Whiteness. Instead of food and coal and medicine, the Biden administration could deliver an even more essential lifesaving commodity and that's diversity into the cultural wasteland of Pitkin County, Colorado, which, if you can believe it, as of tonight, is only one-half of 1% Black.  

Into that, Joe Biden could deposit Haitians, Somalis, and Congolese, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them. Guatemalans, Guineans, Algerians, the entire population of the Cape Verde Islands. We can do that. We're America.

And why stop with those countries? As of tonight, there are still 4 million people living in the impoverished state of Oaxaca,  Do you care about them? We do, because we're good people. So, why shouldn't a quarter of all Oaxacans move to Aspen by next season? And to be clear, not move there to run the chairlifts at Snowmass, move there to ride the chairlifts at Snowmass, to benefit fully from the economic bounty of that isolated, blindingly white mountain community we call Aspen. Is there anything more American than that?  

Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, send these, the homeless tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door. There you go. Aspen is America's new golden door. As former FBI Director Jim Comey, himself an attendee at the Aspen Ideas Festival, once put it on Twitter, ""This country's greatness and true genius lies in its diversity."" Well put, Jim Comey. Well put. It's finally time to bring some greatness and true genius to Aspen, but we can't stop there. Why would we? 

Next stop on the equity train has got to be Martha's Vineyard. It's a natural. Joe Biden took 70% of the vote on that small Massachusetts island. Over the past four years, according to FEC data, 92% of all donations from its biggest town, Edgartown Massachusetts, went to the Democratic Party. So, you probably imagine Edgartown is pretty diverse. I mean, the Obamas live on the island right? No, in fact, we checked at last count, Edgartown is 95.7% White. What century is this? As of 2019, only 3% of all people, all residents in Edgartown were born outside of this country. So, do the math. That's 17 people total. That's effectively zero diversity, which means zero strength.  

They are begging for more diversity. Why not send migrants there in huge numbers? Let's start with 300,000 and move up from there. As the island gets stronger, more and then on to Malibu, another Democratic community, 84% White. Malibu went for Joe Biden with 69% of the vote. 64% of all political donations from Malibu went to Democrats over the last four years. Why not diversity for them, too? Why not a Malibu airlift? How about Burlington, Vermont? 

86% of the residents there voted for Joe Biden, who believes that illegal immigration is a gift. 77% of political donations from Burlington over the past four years went to the Democratic Party and yet it's still troublingly White. Time to decolonize 84% White Burlington. These towns are crying out for help. Martha's Vineyard above all and there's bipartisan support for this effort, by the way. Michelle Obama, ladies and gentlemen.  

Uh huh. It's Michelle Obama lecturing White folks again and you can kind of see why, because White folks, as she just told us, are afraid of her. When she shows up, they leave, but the weird thing is, she moved to Martha's Vineyard, a massive oceanfront estate, global warming be damned and White folks didn't leave. They stayed there along with Michelle Obama. Huh? 

So, maybe we need to diversify Martha's Vineyard immediately. Maybe Michelle Obama is just trying to be the change she wants to see in the world. Maybe she's leading the way. Maybe we send the next 300,000 illegal border crossers on charter flights to Edgartown, Massachusetts, then on to Brookline, Mass and Georgetown, D.C. and Malibu, Bozeman, Burlington. There's no reason the Rio Grande Valley should have all the benefits of diversity.

704	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-doj-hiding-evidence-hunter-bidens-criminal-activity	2022-07-27 22:08:00	Tucker Carlson: DOJ is apparently hiding evidence of Hunter Biden's criminal activity | Fox News	"WARNING—Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices his concerns about the FBI's treatment of the Hunter Biden case compared to the treatment of Trump over January 6 on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Day after day, they bombard you from every news source telling you that  was the worst insurrection since Mussolini's march on Rome. Obviously, they're lying. You know that. They know that. Why are they doing it? Well, they're doing it in the hope that if they scream the lies loud enough for long enough, you will forget what actually happened. We'll remember, for example, that in January of 2017, shortly after Trump won, a fairly large group of elected Democrats tried to overturn what was a free and fair election. They were insurrectionists.  

The group included Congressmen Jamie Raskin, Pramila Jayapal, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Maxine Waters, Jim McGovern and others. And then, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, Nancy Pelosi promoted the dangerous conspiracy theory that the election had been ""hijacked"" by a hostile foreign government, Russia.  

Then on January 13, 2017, because we kept track, Democratic Party holy man John Lewis declared that Donald Trump was not the legitimate president. Talk about breaking our norms! Then, not surprisingly, on Inauguration Day, the Democratic Party's militia descended on Washington. Hundreds of rioters committed vandalism, overturned cars, at one point lit a limousine on fire. Most of the violence was concentrated in Franklin Square. That's just down the street from the Capitol. Six police officers were seriously injured by the rioters. They threw bricks and trash cans. In all, 200 of Nancy Pelosi's forces were arrested. It took 5,000 National Guardsmen to quell the violence. That would be the first of many riots the Democratic Party encouraged during the Trump administration.  

Now, if you're wondering if any of that actually happened, you're seeing it on your screen, and you may be wondering, since no one's mentioned it since it happened. You can look it up because it's all on video. In retrospect, what's interesting, though, is how the Justice Department responded to all this violence. No one at DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Nancy Pelosi or no way into John Lewis for sparking the riots and that was never even under consideration because at the time this was America. Political speech is not a crime in America. It has never been a crime in America.  

Even if extremists use your words to justify their violence, you cannot be arrested for their deeds because we have a First Amendment. Political speech is sacrosanct, period. The Supreme Court has ruled on this many times. It's at the very heart of our system. It is why this is a free country, but in the single most radical move, perhaps of the entire Biden administration, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, has decided to change this. 

The Washington Post is reporting that the Justice Department is investigating former President Donald Trump as part of a criminal probe into January 6. Now, that may confuse you, since Trump did not commit any act of violence on January 6. In fact, he publicly urged his voters to, ""stay peaceful."" When they entered the Capitol building, he told them to go home. That's all on public record, but according to Merrick Garland, Donald Trump is still liable for every single one of his supporters' crimes that day.  

Donald Trump's speech is violence. That's the new rule. Your speech is violence, but here's the thing. That rule applies only to you, to opponents of the Democratic Party. Supporters of the Democratic Party can still say whatever they want. So, what we have here is not just infuriating or hypocritical. It's worse than that. It's the definition of selective justice, and there's nothing scarier than selective justice, which is no justice at all and yet suddenly you see evidence of it everywhere.  

Carry an illegal gun in the Bronx and the chances are you will not go to jail because you voted for Joe Biden. Keep a deer rifle in your closet in Florida, and Joe Biden will blame you for school shootings. That's how it works and again, you see it everywhere. At the same moment DOJ is investigating a former president for saying things Joe Biden didn't like, that same DOJ is apparently hiding evidence of criminal activity by Joe Biden's son, Hunter.  

The latest evidence comes from Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Grassley's office has received whistleblower complaints from within the FBI. Those complaints reveal efforts to ""improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation,"" thereby causing ""investigative activity to cease."" So, call it Russian disinformation and the investigation into whatever Hunter Biden did. In the words of Chuck Grassley, ""The allegations provided to my office appear to indicate that there was a scheme in place among certain FBI officials to undermine derogatory information connected to Hunter Biden by falsely suggesting was disinformation."" 

In other words, not only did they not consider charging the president's son, they actively lied to the public about the nature of his crimes. And to some extent, we saw this play out in public. 50 former intelligence officials at the highest level — Jim Clapper, Mike Hayden, John Brennan, Michael Morell, Andy Liepman—all claimed in public in a publicly circulated letter that  was ""Russian disinformation."" 

It wasn't. It was entirely real. They knew it was real. Not one of them has apologized. Not one of the 50 has apologized for lying on the eve of a presidential election about facts that might have influenced voters to vote differently from the way they voted. They interfered, those 50 intel officials interfered in our democracy. They've never been held accountable. They never even acknowledged what they did. That was happening in public, but in private, according to Chuck Grassley's office, one senior FBI official ordered a Hunter Biden probe closed ""without providing a valid reason as required by FBI guidelines."" Just shut it down. It's the president's son. We want this guy to win. Don't hassle his boy.  

In another case, officials improperly hid damaging information about Hunter Biden in a subfolder that almost nobody at the FBI could find. Ultimately, the FBI appears to have abandoned the case. Most of the media has ignored it from the first day or lied about it, but The New York Post has stayed on this story and so has this network, Fox. It's not because we're interested in Hunter Biden's personal life, which was unusually creepy. It's because the documents on his laptop contain evidence that the president of the United States, Joe Biden, sold political influence to our number one geopolitical rival, a country that considers us its main enemy and that would be China. 

Joe Biden used his public office to enrich his family. That is a crime. It's a crime by statute and it's certainly a moral crime. Now, publicly, Joe Biden has denied this repeatedly. He said he knew nothing about what his son was doing overseas. Here's Biden in 2019.  

 I've never spoke to my son about his overseas business dealings.  

That was a lie. Provably so. That was a flat out lie. You know that because we played to the voicemail of Joe Biden telling Hunter that he's ""in the clear"" after a New York Times piece on his . Hunter Biden accompanied his father, the sitting vice president of the United States on trips to China and met with communist officials. So, that's a lie. We've shown you the picture of Joe Biden golfing with Hunter Biden's business partners.

Most damning is that we have firsthand testimony from one of those partners. His name is Tony Bobulinski. We sat with him for an hour in October of 2020. He told us that Joe Biden stood to gain tens of millions of dollars from a business deal with the Chinese energy company, CEFC. The emails on the laptop,Bobulinski said, identified Joe Biden as ""the big guy."" 

It's kind of amazing looking at that tape for more than a year and a half later, now that Joe Biden is president. That interview took place before the 2020 presidential election. In a normal country with a free press, every claim that Tony Bobulinski made would have been run down by big news organizations. It wouldn't have been up to Fox News and The New York Post to run it down, but they ignored it and they lied about it. Now, one of the names Bobulinski mentioned, you just heard it, was James Gilliar. Here was a business partner of the Biden family. Bobulinski told us in very specific terms that he and Gilliar were setting up deals with the Chinese energy company while Joe Biden was the sitting vice president. 

  

If you think about it for a minute, this whole conversation is ludicrous. Hunter Biden was trading on his father's office. Why else would a Chinese energy company seek him out to do business? Hunter Biden didn't speak Chinese. He knew nothing about energy. He, in fact, never really had a real job in his life, but they promised to pay him tens of millions of dollars because why?  

Because of his expertise in the energy business? It's insane and yet when we aired that video, the usual liars failed to respond. Instead, they attacked Tony Bobulinski, a man who made not one dime for that interview, a man who caused himself untold trouble by giving that interview, a man who provided documentation to back up every single thing he said directly from Hunter Biden's laptop, but they were totally ignored.  

Now we're learning the FBI, which had the laptop when we did that interview, buried it directly, deliberately to protect the president. That's what Grassley's office has just uncovered. They did no investigation whatsoever. Tonight Tony Bobulinski's claims have been corroborated once again. The New York Post has obtained a communication in which James Gilliar, the man you just heard described the Biden family business partner, panics over the possibility that Joe Biden's involvement in this deal might be uncovered.

705	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-american-economy-disaster	2022-07-28 23:04:00	Tucker Carlson: The American economy is currently a disaster | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips President Biden for denying the United States is in a recession despite what economists say on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You think you've got a tough job? Imagine being  handlers. You spend all day trying to keep the guy away from hot mics. That's not easy. Biden feels about microphones the way golden retrievers feel about casseroles. Leave one on a low table and he pounces on it and that's not good for anyone. Biden could declare war on Russia or tell Israeli officials to ""keep alive the honor of the Holocaust,"" both of which, by the way, he's actually done. 

So, there's never any upside in letting Joe Biden speak in public, but unfortunately for the White House, sometimes you don't have a choice. Disasters happen and when they do, the public expects somebody to pretend to be president. The American economy is currently a disaster. Therefore, Joe Biden had to talk, so his aides dutifully let him out to the podium today to say something edifying about it. What happened next has got to be one of the weirdest presidential briefings ever conducted.  

New economic numbers show our GDP has declined for two quarters in a row. That's the definition of a recession. We're in a recession. That's why Joe Biden had to hold the briefing. And yet Biden never once mentioned those numbers, not a single time. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play? It was completely bizarre. Instead, Biden simply announced that there is no recession in the United States, no matter what you may have noticed about your own country. I repeat, there is no recession. In fact, thanks to the stalwart leadership of Joe Biden, we can announce record potato harvests in the provinces. The people are happy and thriving. Period. And with that, Biden left the stage. Watch.  

   

See, dumbo, significant banking personnel say we're not in a recession. Plus, wind turbines. Wind turbines and if you don't believe it, 3.6% unemployment. We are winning. Pay no attention to the millions of former workers who are being paid by the government to stay home, leaving businesses without anyone to staff them. Why is the ice cream stand near your house closed in July? Well, because welfare pays more than scooping ice cream does. But ignore that. The economy is in great shape. 

If there's one thing that might make it even better other than wind turbines, it's printing billions more in fake money, which will definitely not accelerate our already . That's why we're calling it the Inflation Reduction Act, because more money in the system will reduce inflation. It will, and it will because we say it will because what matters is not the way that things actually are, what matters are the words we use to describe things.  

We can change reality merely by calling it something else. If we call a man a woman, that's what she is. If we call an open border a secure border, that's what we have, and as you just saw, if we tell you that a collapsing economy is a robust economy, well, then it's time to celebrate our newfound prosperity and feel free to buy champagne on your EBT card. It's on us. It turns out that when you think you’re God, all that matters is what you say, your commands. ""In the beginning was the Word"" and this week the word was definitely not ""recession."" 

That word is now an operative. It's obsolete and frankly, it's embarrassing. It's like ""stewardess"" or ""fireman"" or ""the orient."" It's not something you'd say are uneducated people. So, to herald this important new change to our language, on July 21st, the White House officially changed the definition of recession. They said it, so it's true now. In a blog post, officials explained that two consecutive quarters of declining GDP is ""neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle."" Not convinced? Well, you're not watching television because every official in the Biden administration, all these credentialed economists, went on camera to swear it was true.  

No, we're not redefining recession.  

Okay. So, ignore the tape of Janet Yellen. We shouldn't have played that. It's hard to think clearly. Ignore how mind bogglingly repulsive she is, ignore all the work she's done herself to destroy the American economy when she ran the Federal Reserve. Listen to what they're saying. Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, that's not the definition of recession. Really? We thought it was. We thought that for about 50 years. Turns out we’re insane. We're hallucinating. Lucy in the sky with diamonds stuff and the media have confirmed it.  

This is from Politico,: ""The White House is pretty obviously right that even two quarters of shrinking GDP would not show the economy is currently in recession."" That's the word from Ben White, who is the chief economics reporter at Politico and he's backed up by the Associated Press, which is totally real. Just today, the AP reported that, ""The U.S. economy shrank for a second straight quarter, raising fears the nation may be approaching a recession."" 

Oh, we're getting close now. In other words, two declining quarters of growth is not a recession, just like the White House said, and that sounds definitive. It's always been that way as long as you don't have a memory that extends past, say, last week, because it was a few weeks ago before the White House declared otherwise that everyone was saying differently, including Ben White and the AP. They were still using the term stewardess. They were using the old definition. Want examples?  

Okay, how about this? June 22nd of this year, this same Ben White, assuming he's real, wrote in Politico, which unfortunately is and we're quoting: ""I'm sorry to report that the conditions are ripe for a slide in gross domestic product growth that lasts at least two quarters, the technical definition of recession."" Ooh, Ben White. Could that be the same Ben White, the same Politico? Could be. And then in January of this year, which is 2022, we think the AP reported the same thing, and we're quoting: ""Mexico's economy entered a technical recession at the end of last year with two consecutive quarters of contraction."" 

Oh, wow. So, it turns out that was the definition prior to two weeks ago. In fact, it's been the definition for decades. In fact, you'll find it in every economic textbook ever written. It's all over the archives of the AP, which because we're paid to do it, we slog through today. Here's one example. ""French economy falls back into recession,"" the AP reported back in 2013. Here's a direct quote from the article ""A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth."" 

Oh, you're not insane. No one dosed you. You're not hallucinating. Even CNN used to say this. As CNN White House correspondent John Harwood wrote on August 20th, 2019, back during Trump and Big Orange ran things no more quoting ""recession equals economy shrinks for two quarters."" Oh, wow. 

In fact, not to belabor the point, even Brian Deese, who is now the top White House economic adviser, used to run with that definition and we're quoting ""economists have a technical definition of recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth."" He wrote that back in 2008. Unfortunately for him, we found it and yet this week, everything's different because you can't say stewardess is anymore. So, this is new position is ""two negative quarters of GDP growth is not the technical definition of recession."". 

Wow. Okay. If you say so, because in the beginning was the word you are god now, but that does raise the question, if it's not a recession, then what is it? Well, for this and all other important matters, including intimate marital questions, we go to the White House press secretary who informs us it's not a recession. It's ""a transition.""  

We're in a ""transition."" Does that mean the whole country is now taking puberty blockers and becoming a girl? No, different kind of transition. This is a transition to green energy and renewables. Joe Biden announced today say it's a transition to handing China our energy grid. Oh, that's a transition. Some might call it a collapse of empire in a subsequent disaster where we're ruled by people who hate us. But no, it's a transition in which China gets to making control the wind turbines, the lithium, the solar panels. Hmm.  

What do actual voters think about this. Who cares cause that only matters in a democracy, but we'll tell you anyway. Americans do not want to hand our energy grid to China or stop using air conditioning in the summer or drive your stupid little electric cars. Right. Because it turns out no one believes the experts who have told us the world is going to end for the past 50 years, but who still buy beachfront property.  

Paging you, Barack Obama and most people kind of understand what's going to happen next. They could become Sri Lanka, a country that destroyed itself, committed national suicide in pursuit of a high ESG score. Turns out actual people of both parties, just all normal people, want to do things like afford gasoline or have someplace to live they can afford.  

What Joe Biden said today will get us much closer to Sri Lanka. There's kind of no dispute about that. We also know for certain that the spending under the Biden administration, under previous administrations, but certainly dramatically accelerated under Biden has devalued the dollar to the point that we have massive inflation and a decline in GDP, because as money loses value and things get more expensive, people at some point can't afford to buy as much and then gross domestic product declines. 

It's not like some crazy theory. In fact, even the Fed Reserve Bank of San Francisco, hardly a right-wing institution, has pointed out that Joe Biden's spending in his first year in office singlehandedly hiked the inflation rate by at least 3%. That's higher than many other developed countries, including Germany, Canada and the UK. So, what's been the effect for the rest of us? Now, they can say there's no recession and the word is like ""fireman,"" you just don't say it, but what's America look like? Well, I don't know. Let’s check your local food bank. 

There is a good chance your local food bank is overwhelmed. In Boise, Idaho, for example, the Meridian Foodbank reports they've gone from serving 2,800 people every month to 4,200 in just the last year. Another nearby food bank called the Care House Food Bank has reported a similar increase. A spokesman for the Care House told a local news station, ""We're finding out that with the rising rent costs and the rising gasoline costs, the rent each first, the gasoline eats second. So, the family has very little to buy food to eat."" 

Sounds like a rich country to you, a place that's thriving, that can afford to turn its energy grid over to China? No. It's the same story across the country. Allentown, Pennsylvania—the Allentown Area Ecumenical Food Bank reports a massive increase in families who need food. In the biggest food producing country in the world? Yeah, that's us, but still, the food banks director told the local news station there, ""Since October, we've tripled the number of families we're serving every month."" She added, 300 of the 18,00 families she served this month are first time visitors. They haven't spent years at the food bank. They need to now because the economy is in, sorry to use the word, recession.  

Outside St Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix, the AP reported that hundreds of families lined up this month. The line went around the block. The food bank’s main distribution center served 4,271 families in just one week last month. That's a 78% increase compared to last year. According to the AP, ""More than 900 families line up at the distribution center every weekday for an emergency government food box stuffed with goods such as canned beans, peanut butter and rice."" That's a breadline, by the way. That's a breadline in the United States. Did you see that on NBC Nightly News? Probably not. It was happening everywhere. 

Alameda Foodbank in California, similar numbers. They've gone from 890 households served on a typical Friday in January to more than 1,400 families on a typical Friday last month. In central Florida, the Second Harvest Food Bank, which supplies around 500 food bank partners in the region, says the number of people looking for food, not for vacations in Antigua or a new Tesla, but for food to eat so they can survive, has gone up 25% in the last month. 

The food bank used to distribute 150,000 meals overall a day. Now they're up to a quarter million and that number is rising. The food bank’s director says the cause is inflation. Obviously, ""it costs quite a bit to put millions and millions of pounds of food out the door every week and every month."" Tell that to a local news station. So, does the White House notice any of this? Do they know what's happening? Who knows what they know. They certainly don't care. They're saying it out loud. 

Joe Biden's top economic adviser, Brian Deese, is telling you that it doesn't matter. You're worried about inflation? Well, it's easy for Americans to find food, says Brian Deese. Watch. 

Oh, lower your expectations of America. That sound you're hearing is the goalposts moving. So, we went very quickly now from ""Build Back Better"" to ""Hey, at least you're not starving to death at least from a famine."" Well, hold on a second, Powell. This was America like a year and a half ago where the planes took off on time and people were getting killed every day on the subway and there wasn't filth and graffiti and drug addicts on the streets and people weren't worried about having enough to eat.  

Those were our first world expectations, like electricity in the summertime. Oh, but there's no famine. Just be glad there's no famine and do your part, they're telling us, to save us from the climate crisis, one that somehow isn't affecting oceanfront property in Malibu and Martha's Vineyard, but not just the climate crisis to save democracy in Ukraine. Way more important than inflation, your stupid economic concerns.  

Just the other day, the president of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, the man they're telling us is the new George Washington, decided, you know what, I don't have to pretend to care about the United States anymore. I think Americans are ridiculous, decadent, overfed and I have contempt for them. So, he was asked, wait a second, ""Can America afford to send $60 billion to your corrupt autocracies so you can shoot dramatic magazine photo covers for Vogue?"" 

Well, of course, said Zelenskyy and we're quoting ""inflation, who's thinking about inflation? We're fighting for absolute communal values."" 

What? Whose values? We're not in anything communal with you, pal. You run a corrupt little Eastern European country. We have a right to worry about our own country and yet, the White House, they agree with Zelenskyy. That's almost word for word what our national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said when he was asked the exact same question on July 22nd. Americans are worried about sending all this money to Ukraine at a time when inflation is out of control and Americans don't have enough money, I don't know, to buy food or pay rent. So, the moderator at the Aspen Institute, which needs a lot more immigrants from the Third World immediately, as we told you tonight, asked this and you know what Jake Sullivan said fundamentally, I don't care. Watch this.  

   

 I

I mean, this is the John Malkovich portion of the of our session.  

So, here you have Jake Sullivan and Jeff Goldberg, two midwits who have accomplished pretty much nothing in their entire lives, talking about the issues that will define this country for our grandchildren before an audience in Aspen and saying things like, ""I'm not worried at all"" and then the audience titters and you wonder and historians will review tapes like that when they try to figure out what actually happened to this thriving civilization we had, you wonder if these people can hear themselves. Do they know how they look? Do they know how ridiculous they are? Do they know how deeply the public despises them for good reason?  

""Do you worry about criticism, we're setting billions of dollars for Ukraine and not spending it here?"" ""Fundamentally, no,"" and Jake Sullivan isn't worried because he knows he can call inflation transitory when it's not. He can deny we're in recession when we're obviously in one because the words are all that matter to them, not the reality. 

They don't walk through midtown in Manhattan and notice, ""Hey, this is disgusting. This is worse than Mumbai. How did it get this way?"" They don't even notice. Tomorrow we're going have an hour-long investigation into the actual state of our economy, how we got here, how we get out.

706	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-us-recession-economy-shrinking-all-year	2022-07-29 22:00:00	Tucker Carlson: The US is in a recession, the economy has been shrinking all year | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson dissects the Biden administration's handling of the economy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It didn't take long. It took, well, about a year and a half for the Biden administration to destroy the American economy and drive this nation into a recession. Now, the Biden administration won't admit that . In fact, they've actually redefined the word ""recession"" just as they've redefined the words ""democracy,"" ""racism"" and ""woman,"" but you don't need to know what the word is to know what is happening. If you live here, you see it every single day.  

We're in a recession. The economy has been shrinking all year. Real wages are at record lows and at the same time, inflation is the highest it's been in the lifetime of most Americans. So, call it whatever you want, but it's a recession and it's scary and they're ignoring it. We're going to spend the next hour investigating how exactly this happened. How did they tank the economy so fast and what does it mean? 

To get to the answers to those questions, we're going to speak to people who have actual credibility on economics and that emphatically does not include our most highly credentialed economists, people who, like the public health experts we've watched the last two and a half years, have thoroughly beclowned and discredited themselves. 

A year ago, right about the time he told us that vaccines will absolutely prevent you from getting or transmitting COVID, Joe Biden was asked about, ""Hey, what happens if we go into a recession?"" In response, as he invariably does, Joe Biden invoked highly credentialed experts. Watch this. 

Every word read off a teleprompter. A decade from now, we're going to see tape like that and think, ""I cannot believe that man was the president of the United States."" But consider what his handlers wrote for him. The experts Biden was referring to are, in fact, some of the most well-credentialed figures in all of academic economics. In fact, two months later, in September of last year, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics signed a letter urging Joe Biden to spend as much money as possible and we're quoting ""The Build Back Better package,"" they wrote, ""will transform the U.S. economy to be more efficient without presenting an inflationary threat."" 

So, go ahead and spend more money, create it out of thin air, print it and there's no chance you'll get inflation. Winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics said that. If you took Econ 101, you're laughing at that. 

By the way, it wasn't just them. The chairman of the , said the same thing. ""The incoming data are very consistent with the view that inflation will move down toward our goals,"" Powell said.  

It's like idiotic, and it turned out not to be true. Now, the remarkable thing, the way you know this isn't simply incompetence, they did this on purpose, is what happened when these so-called experts were exposed as frauds, which they are. Not a single one of these eminent Nobel Prize-winning economists ever apologized for the letter they wrote or even explained how they got it wrong. They're still saying the same thing — spend more money, and it won't affect inflation because when you have much more of something, it's worth the same. 

Oh, because supply and demand isn't real. They're all saying this to the extent they're even paying attention. Most of them aren't. They're way off into lifestyle liberal-land, like they all are. They're worried about trans rights. The St .Louis Fed, for example, one of the most important financial institutions in the United State, one of the banks that make up the central bank, they've been conducting studies about what? About what monetary policy would be best to avoid complete economic collapse? Well, you'd think so. That's their job, but that's not what they've been doing.  

Instead, for the past month, (We're not making this up) the St. Louis Fed has been meditating on equity, a term that no one can really define, but clearly means your life, Mr. and Mrs. American, is about to get much worse.  

So, just as Joe Biden audibly took office, equity is now the top priority of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. Again, books will be written about this years from now and no one believe it actually happened, but it's real. Take a look at their website. Some of the top articles on the website, on the blog of the St. Louis Fed include, ""Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Access to COVID-19 Relief,"" ""COVID-19 Disruption by race, Ethnicity and Geography,"" ""The Role of Diversity in Public Institutions,"" and ""Reducing Racial Employment Gaps for Young Adults Without College Education."" 

Again, this is not a syllabus from the sociology department at Brandeis. This is the Fed. These are the people in charge of our monetary policy who are supposed to be keeping America from collapsing. But they're ignoring their actual job in favor of pretending that they're professors at Brandeis.  

It's lunatic and they're still talking this way. In April, well after it was very clear inflation was not transitory, Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, former head of the Fed, someone who should be charged for what she did to the U.S. economy, gave a speech not about the U.S. economy. She's the Treasury Secretary. No, but about climate change and why climate change is more important than saving the United States.  

We're quoting, ""We must redouble our efforts to decarbonize our economies,"" Yellen said at an address at the Atlantic Council. Keep in mind, Janet Yellen doesn't know anything about climate. She can't drive a standard transmission. She knows nothing about the material world, but there she is, spouting off on climate change and decarbonizing, reading every stupid, faddish talking point the Atlantic Council audience wanted to hear about and she's still doing it. We're in a slow-down, she said on Sunday, and it's not affecting too many sectors of the economy, says Janet Yellen. Watch. 

Okay. Let's be clear. Janet Yellen is a completely incompetent affirmative-action hire who did profound generational damage to the United States during her time running the Fed. Now, she's doing the same while running the Treasury Department and yet no one ever calls her on it. The things she says don't make sense. She can't even predict inflation when every single other person in the country knew it was coming based on the federal government's spending patterns. 

Keep spending money. That's what she's still saying. Everyone in the Biden administration is saying that. In May, the head of USAID, Samantha Power—she's back— declared that worldwide fertilizer shortage is actually a good thing. Starvation is a good thing because that means fewer carbon emissions. Never let a crisis go to waste, she said. She actually said that.  

Inside the White House, no one's even pretending to care as the U.S. economy falls apart. They're not worried about the oil supply. In fact, they're selling our oil to our main global rival, China. They're not worried about the stock market. They couldn't tell you what's up or down. They cannot even define a recession. The one thing they're sure of is everything's fine, except for the trans community, which is suffering under your bigotry. Here's our press secretary. 

Does the president mind that some of this oil that was meant to ease the pain for consumers is headed overseas?  

I have not seen that report, so I would honestly have to go look into it and see what the truth is in that statement that you just laid out and see exactly what's happening. I just have not seen that report.  

Is he adamant that there is not going to be recession?  

I mean, it's not our definition. Right. We're talking about a definition from NBER. 

And what is exactly the White House's definition of a recession?  

Again, we don't, we don't, I'm not going to define it from here. 

We're not going to define a recession. We're not going to acknowledge it's even happening, and so they're not and no one's forcing them to. That's what they're saying. This is untenable. Unless you're an utterly partisan economist, you have to acknowledge what's happening. But those highly credentialed are not acknowledging it. They're blaming Putin. They're blaming January 6 and of course, on the basic point of whether the economy is in trouble, there are very few people left to deny it.  

  

So, if Larry Summers, who literally blamed the insurrection on January 6 for inflation, and Paul Krugman, who's been wrong about everything, humiliates himself weekly in The New York Times, if they're admitting that actually the economy is in trouble, then there's really no denying it. You can't deny it. We've reached the limit of denial.  

Take a look at this chart. Notice that right before the 2008 recession, the consumer price index was surging just as it is now. Prices went up until the crash, so they always crash. Why does that happen? What happens? For a simple reason. Goods become too expensive for people to buy and then GDP collapses. The IMF is sending out warning signals as well. They now predict a global recession as soon as next year. What happens then?

707	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-chinese-leaders-treated-pelosi-arrival-invasion	2022-08-02 23:19:00	Tucker Carlson: Chinese leaders treated Pelosi's arrival like an invasion | Fox News	"The 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host discusses the potential consequences of Speaker Pelosi's 'totally pointless' trip to Taiwan.

The thing about the Chinese government is, and this is kind of weird, the Chinese government almost never celebrates diversity. Think about that. American liberals, liberals throughout the West, love China. It's Justin Trudeau's model, but China does not celebrate diversity. In fact, and the American media never says this, but it's absolutely true, China is a militarized ethno-state. It's run along traditional fascist lines for the benefit of a specific ethnic group: the Han Chinese. 

It's not supposed to be allowed, but they're doing it. So, to Chinese leaders, the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion, those concepts make no sense at all. At best, they're bizarre. It's one of those incomprehensible jokes that Western liberals tell. The Chinese don't get it at all. So, when  for Taiwan today aboard a U.S. military jet, the Chinese government did not issue a statement applauding her remarkable display of spunky girl power. No one in Beijing congratulated Nancy Pelosi for breaking glass ceilings as the very first speaker in history to identify as a woman. No one in China even mentioned that. 

Instead, Chinese leaders treated Pelosi's arrival like an invasion. Air raid sirens sounded in coastal towns in China as her plane approached. When she finally landed, the Chinese military announced live fire exercises in the airspace around Taiwan for the next four days. China's Foreign Ministry declared that Nancy Pelosi's mere presence ""gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."" Proving that in Asia, as at home, things rarely improve when Nancy Pelosi shows up. So, the question really is, why did she go in the first place? That's the real question — and the official line in Washington, as always, is totally implausible, is that Pelosi's trip was designed to ""reaffirm Taiwan's status as a U.S. ally."" 

OK, except the problem is, Taiwan is not a U.S. ally. In fact, Taiwan may be the only country in the world the Biden administration believes does not have the right of self-determination. ""We do not support Taiwan's independence,"" said the Pentagon spokesman just the other day. Wait a second. They're against democracy? You know that they were for democracy, right? They are always throwing democracy at you. Turns out, they don't mean it, not that you ever thought they did.  

So, the one thing you can be certain of is that Nancy Pelosi did not fly all the way to Taiwan to signal that the United States is going to defend that island from a Chinese invasion. We're not going to do that. We're not in a position to do that, even if we wanted to do that. We've already sent too many of our surface-to-air missiles, for example, to Ukraine, where our oligarch friends are busy selling them to various dark actors on the international arms market. So, if there's a major war in Asia any time soon, we will not be winning it. Every sober person knows that. Sad but true. 

So, what's really going on here? Well, on the internet, you may have noticed quite a bit of speculation, some of it generated by Chinese state media, that Pelosi went to Taiwan to check on investments that her husband Paul made using insider information. Now, he did make those investments and yes, used insider information. That's why he's such a fantastic stock picker worth more than $100 million. In this case, Paul Pelosi bought semiconductor stock. Taiwan makes semiconductors. Rising tensions in the region would create more demand for semiconductors. That's the theory. 

Is it true? Well, Nancy Pelosi is from Baltimore, so we wouldn't put anything past her, but it doesn't quite satisfy as an explanation. That is a long and highly public trip to take for a relatively small investment. There's got to be something else going on. What is it? Well, it is entirely possible that the most obvious explanation for this debacle is the right one. It's possible that the Biden administration is so completely incompetent, the people who run the White House are so utterly blinded by their own arrogance and their ineptitude, that they just don't appreciate or even understand the implications of what they are doing. So, Nancy Pelosi got bored of spending the summer in Napa and she wanted to take a free trip to Asia where she can pretend to be a statesman for a week. Girl power. Let her go.  

It's possible that's all the thinking they did before signing off on Pelosi's trip. Here, for example, is the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, who you're supposed to take seriously, proving the point effectively this morning on Fox.  

Oh, so there's no reason that this visit should escalate tensions in any way whatsoever. Thanks, John Kirby, for describing the world as you fervently wish it was. We'd love to know your views on perpetual motion machines. Now back to reality as we actually find it.  has, in fact, dramatically escalated tensions in the region throughout Asia. In fact, escalated the more than any single act in recent memory. So, you have to ask yourself, for what? How exactly is the United States, which she serves, benefiting from what she's doing? Is there an upside here for us? 

That's one question that people like John Kirby never think to ask. They just assume that China must be bluffing. Just another backward, third-world government making huffing noises. You don't you take them seriously, just like Russia. ""Well, they say they're going to invade Ukraine if we push Ukraine to join NATO. Who cares what they think. They're a gas station with a government. They're bluffing.""

That's what arrogance does. It blinds you to reality. So, the question is: Is China bluffing? What if they're not? What if, in response to Pelosi's totally pointless trip to Taiwan, the Chinese decide to seize the Cayman Islands, which are now governed by Taiwan, in whose defense we've implicitly and effectively guaranteed for 75 years? Well, that could actually happen. The Chinese government is already making the kind of noises you would expect it to make before doing something like that. Here's a selection. 

Huh. Maybe that's bluffing. Maybe it's not, but the deeper question is, when's the last time American liberals built something? When is the last time Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or any of these people, Susan Rice, created something worth having? Hmm. We'll give you a few minutes. Never. They break things. They show up. They make things worse. They move on to the next thing. They never apologize. They did it in Afghanistan. They did it in Iraq. They did it in Ukraine. They did it in Syria. They did it in Libya. Are they going to do it now with China? Breaking things.  

In fact, if you were trying to give Beijing a pretext to seize Taiwan, this is exactly the kind of trip you would take. And what would happen if Beijing seized Taiwan? Well, it would be a humanitarian disaster for the Taiwanese. They would lose any semblance of self-determination. Democracy would die, so that's bad, but more to the point, it would be a disaster for us. For us, because it would make, and this would be the effect of virtually every policy to come out of the Biden administration, it would make China more powerful. How powerful is China? We understate their power actually.  

China already makes 90% of the world's antibiotics. It makes 80% of the world's lithium batteries, 96% of the shipping containers used to transport goods across the world, mostly from China, are made in China, but one thing China does not yet control is the semiconductor industry. At the end of 2021, China held just 4% of the global semiconductor market. North America and the Asia-Pacific region are the dominant players.  

Now, semiconductors are not a small thing. In fact, they're essential to modern life. They're in everything from brake sensors in your car to your phone, to your computer. They're in everything and as it happens, virtually all advanced semiconductors are made — where are they made? — oh, they're made in Taiwan. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. It is by far the world's largest semiconductor foundry. Without the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, that would mean companies like Apple, Qualcomm and many others could not function. That's a lot of the American economy.  

Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company accounted for more than half of the total foundry revenue in the world. So, maybe showing up in Taiwan would give Beijing a pretext to invade Taiwan and take over the world's largest semiconductor foundry, and that puts us in the beta position to an even greater extent, to put it mildly. Is that the goal of this trip? Could it be that Tony Blinken and Barack Obama and the rest of the people who are actually running the Biden administration without the knowledge of Joe Biden, who can't remember anything at this point, could it be that all these people know perfectly well how reckless this is, know perfectly well what the effects could be, and they're doing it, not just in spite of those effects, but because of those effects because actually, at least on some gut level, they want to hasten the end of American hegemony, which is to say the end of the U.S. as we know it?  

That would explain why they sent Kamala Harris, of all people, to avert a war on Ukraine, knowing full well that Kamala Harris would read the notes they wrote for her and insist that Ukraine join NATO and then guarantee that Russia invades Ukraine, constricts the world's energy and food markets, and makes us weaker. Huh? Maybe they knew that would happen. Maybe they're not that stupid. Maybe that would also explain why they sent in Nancy Pelosi over to Taiwan effectively as the administration's representative, even though Nancy Pelosi rivals Kamala Harris in her inability to form a coherent thought. Now again, we alluded to this last night, but it's just true because we watch this stuff. We hope you don't. Hope you have a real life, but if you see Nancy Pelosi recently, since she turned 80, for example, two years ago, you know this is someone who is having a lot of trouble speaking. Here was Pelosi at a briefing back in November, for example. 

So, at this point, August of 2022, Taiwan is the world's great flashpoint. It's the largest power with an aim. It has articulated repeatedly over almost 80 years to invade a neighboring country, Taiwan. There's no more delicate place diplomatically on the globe. So, if you're sending that person to calm tensions or reassure allies, you're probably not doing what you say you're doing. You may be doing the opposite. If you're trying to provoke your enemies and terrify your so-called allies, you'd probably pick  in Taiwan.

What is going on here? Well, if you're wanting to understand the motive of the people in charge, consider this: At the same moment that we are clearly goading other countries into conflict with each other and with us, we are, meaning the Biden administration is, degrading our ability to participate or prevail in those wars. Our defensive capabilities have never been weaker and that's not an accident. They did it. For example, the Central Intelligence Agency, whatever you think of it, we don't think much, kind of important to our country, certainly well-funded, here's a recent recruiting ad from the CIA.  

Oh, you're intersectional with a generalized anxiety disorder? Come work in a critical federal agency. So, if you're running an ad like that, not only are you not serious, you are trying to degrade and hurt the ability of the United States to defend itself, to perpetuate itself, to remain the United States for our grandchildren. Let's stop lying about this, that's exactly what they're doing, and it's not just happening at CIA. 

Nothing Joe Biden has done in the last year-and-a-half has made our armed forces better prepared to fight wars. Instead, it has been one calculated humiliation after another for the U.S. Armed Forces: vax mandates, anti-White ideology, sex changes, drag shows — whatever is necessary to telegraph to the United States military, ""You are worthless. You are defending a country that does not deserve to be defended. Your traditions are disgusting. You're terrible."" 

That's the message. Here's the latest: The VA has decided to desecrate military cemeteries. That would be America's last remaining national shrine. Our military cemeteries desecrated with industrial wind turbines. One just went up at a Massachusetts National Cemetery. So, take three steps back. They are starting more wars while simultaneously making it harder for the United States to fight and prevail in those wars. 

More childish posturing from people who have no idea what they're talking about and no skin in the game whatsoever. The truth is, we're not in a position to prosecute a successful war against China. We should be. We should have been making defensive, strategic moves for the past 20 years, on-shoring critical manufacturing, building up a strong military and, yes, a strong CIA, not degrading them with identity politics and other pointless lunacy that detracts from the mission, which is to protect the United States, but that's exactly what we've done. Republicans in Congress have allowed it to happen. Oh, more funding for you. 

So, whatever the motive here is, the effect is absolutely predictable. As with Afghanistan and Ukraine and COVID and pick nine other disasters when what we're watching right now finally ends, the U.S. is likely to be weaker and China is likely to be stronger. So, what does this mean? It means the beginning of the end of American influence in Asia, influence that we paid for with blood, and that's not an overstatement. 

More than half a million American servicemen were killed or wounded in the Pacific theater in the Second World War and in Korea a few years after that and as a result of their sacrifice and wise diplomacy, countries like Japan and South Korea and Singapore and the Philippines have all been in our orbit, the Western orbit, America's orbit for most of the last century, and that's been a good thing for all involved. Not perfect, but better than the alternative. But we're about to see the alternative, thanks to whatever the motive — the lunacy of people like Pelosi and Biden.

708	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-no-wonder-democrats-unpopular-nothing-offer	2022-08-03 22:59:00	Tucker Carlson: No wonder Democrats are unpopular, they have nothing to offer | Fox News	"WARNING—Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the top issues of the Democratic Party on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you're an incumbent member of Congress, pretty much the last thing you ever want to do is debate a primary opponent in public. As a sitting member, you already have every possible advantage. Unless you drop dead during a speech or get drunk and take your clothes off on a commercial airplane, you are very likely to be re-elected to Congress, so a televised debate cannot help you. It is all risk and no upside, but occasionally there is no avoiding it. 

Democrats held a  in New York City last night. They had no choice. Both the candidates in this race are incumbents. Thanks to a court decision that redrew congressional boundaries, the two most powerful members of the New York delegation are now running against each other for the same seat. That's a lot of fun. For 30 years, Carolyn Maloney has represented the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Over the same period, 30 years, Jerry Nadler has represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Jerry Nadler is 75 years old. Carolyn Maloney is 76 years old. Rather than do the obvious thing and retire, the two are now competing for the newly drawn 12th Congressional District that will combine the Upper East Side and the Upper West Sides of Manhattan. 

It turns out to be the richest district in American politics. Four of the Democratic Party's five top fundraising zip codes are within this district's boundaries. So, there's a lot at stake and we forced ourselves to watch the debate. We were richly rewarded for doing that. We're going to start tonight with a headline from the debate, which you've already likely seen. Neither one of these people is cheerleading for Joe Biden. Here's Carolyn Maloney.

""I don't believe he's running for reelection."" That's what Carolyn Maloney said. Well, like everything she says, it's not exactly a profound observation. Of course, Joe Biden isn't running for re-election. He can barely find the men's room. The second the midterms are done, he will find a way to tell the rest of us that. So, that was not very interesting. It was predictable. What was very interesting and what tells you a lot about the Democratic Party is how these two candidates talked about their personal accomplishments and their goals for the country.  

Now, we should tell you, having watched it, that figuring out exactly what Maloney and Nadler were trying to say was not easy. These are not spry, articulate people. They're not magicians with the English language. Jerry Nadler, so enervated he had to sit for the entire debate because he is too weak to stand, but at one point, Nadler gathered the strength to boast about his greatest accomplishment in the Congress — that would be impeaching George W. Bush twice. 

Twice. The secret to Jerry Nadler has never been his appearance, often remarked upon. It's been his intellect, which is small. Obviously, Nadler meant to say Donald Trump, not that he can remember what decade it is, but what he meant to say is not really a consolation for Democrats watching at home. The problem here is that Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney, these are two of the most powerful Democrats in the United States Congress, running in the most influential district in the United States of America — neither of these candidates have anything to say.  

So, Jerry Nadler is asked, ""What are you proud of?"" And he's talking about multiple impeachments. Whatever you think of impeachments, did they improve a single life in this country? No. So, she was asked the same question, Carol Maloney. What are you proud of? What are your priorities? And so, she responded. Here are Carolyn Maloney's priorities for the United States. 

So, those are her top priorities. This is one of the most powerful sitting members of Congress. First priority: protecting women. In other words: more abortions, protecting women from having children so they can continue to work in some depressing midtown bank. Don't raise your family. Go to work. What Carolyn Maloney does not mean by protecting women, of course, is punishing criminals. They're free to beat women on the subway in New York with no consequences, and they routinely do, but that's number one, protecting women, more abortions. 

Okay. Number two, gun safety laws. Now, none of these gun safety laws, meaning gun confiscation laws, will be enforced in places where the Democrats get a huge percentage of the vote, like Chicago or Baltimore or New York or Gary, Indiana. They get a pass, but disarm the other side and then number three, combating climate change because you don't need air conditioning in the summertime. You don't need a car. Look at Sri Lanka. They've done a great job. What's interesting is what Carolyn Maloney didn't mention as a top priority, and that would be the economy, inflation, and it's interesting because every poll taken shows that inflation is the number one issue that actual Americans care about.  

So, why wouldn't Carolyn Maloney, who's a politician after all, can probably read a poll, why would she not include inflation? Well, it's possible she's not aware it's happening and we know this from the president of the San Francisco Fed. That would be Mary Daly. She explained her views on inflation inadvertently. Apparently, she was unaware she was being recorded and because she didn't know anyone was listening, Daly explained that inflation doesn't matter to her because she's rich, and we're quoting, ""I don't find myself in a space,"" that's how they talk in San Francisco, in a space, ""where I have to make tradeoffs because I have enough and many Americans have enough.""

Oh, you've got enough. You've got enough. Stop your whining. Time to fix the climate. We're in charge of the weather now. So, these are the issues that the leaders of the  and the party's donors, many of them in San Francisco and New York, care about. They don't care about inflation because they're rich and it doesn't affect them. In other words, they don't care about you at all and by the way, this isn't just true of long-standing establishment figures in the Democratic Party, like Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney. It's everywhere. It's endemic. It's in the fabric of the party itself. 

Even people who want to join the club repeat the same lines. At the debate last night, Maloney and Nadler, at 76 and 75, were joined by a 38-year-old lawyer called Suraj Patel. Now, Patel runs a multimillion-dollar hotel management company. He was the guy on stage who is supposed to be a breath of fresh air, the face of a new generation. So, what did he talk about? Issues that people care about? No. He referred back 15 years to describe his so-called ideas because it turns out he's an Obama Democrat.  

Yeah. That guy's got new ideas and energy, just like Barack Obama. That's why he's supporting Joe Biden running for re-election again. It's pathetic. It's not just him. It's not just Maloney, such as poor Jerry Nadler. It's the entire Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has run out of gas.  

The Democratic Party at this point is a cartel that exists only to perpetuate itself and the elderly mediocrities who run and benefit from it — all of them. Kamala Harris is only 57 years old. She's a child by the standards of her party, but she still talks like a dementia patient, slowly and incomprehensibly. Here's Kamala struggling to explain what mail-in ballots are. Now you'd think she would understand mail-in ballots given that mail-in ballots are why she has a job, but she doesn't.  

We don't mean to beat up on Kamala Harris, who's obviously our favorite for the Democratic nomination next cycle, but she is the perfect distillation of everybody in power in the Democratic Party. Every word that emerges from Kamala Harris's mouth is a recycled talking point that's been run through a banality machine to remove the slightest hint of anything interesting or challenging or relevant or meaningful. So, no wonder Democrats are unpopular. They have nothing to offer.  

They haven't updated their files. They believe it's 2005. You see this in foreign policy, particularly. They are living in their heads in a world in which the U.S. wields the world's most powerful military, backed by the world's strongest economy, and can do whatever it wants just by telling other people to obey. So, like Joe Biden, you just tell Russia, ""Don't invade Ukraine,"" and of course it won't. We're America. 

You just let China know that we back Taiwan and the entire 75-year-old dispute over that island will be settled forever. They really believe that. They have no idea of this country's relative place in the world order because they don't know anything about reality as it stands right now. So, here's Nancy Pelosi, who imagines that she's so powerful that she can somehow bring about an indefinite peace in the Taiwan Strait just by saying so. 

It doesn't mean anything. It's the barking of dogs. It's less relevant than dogs barking and trust us, the Chinese know that, but from Nancy Pelosi's perspective, ""I said it. Therefore, it's going to happen. Problem solved."" That's the world they believe we still live in. They imagine the United States is still so rich and powerful that we can afford any sort of pointless frivolity. We can tamper with the formula and suffer no ill effects. 

We can hire trans admirals and intersectional CIA officers and everything is going to be fine. That's how powerful we are. We can force Delta Airlines and United to apply affirmative action standards to airline pilots and somehow our planes will never crash because nothing bad ever happens in the world. These people have completely lost touch with reality. How out-of-touch are they? Well, the Democratic Party's main radical right now is Sandy Cortez of Westchester.  

How radical is Sandy Cortez? Well, she spends her days defending the intel agencies and neocon foreign policy and the big banks. So, if your revolutionaries are reading scripts written by the World Economic Forum, maybe they're not actually very revolutionary. Maybe they're defending the status quo, and that's exactly what they're doing and they're doing it because they have no other plan. 

The sad truth is the people who run the Democratic Party have just given up. They've given up on the country and given up on the people who live here. They've got no solutions for you. They're not even pretending that they do. ""Climate! Trans!"" They don't imagine a future. That's why they're telling you, ""Smoke more weed, take more pills. Might as well cut off your junk and pretend to be a girl. Sterilize your kids. Abort your babies. There's no future worth having."" 

That's not a caricature. They're saying that out loud. They're done. Now, the Republican Party, by contrast, is suddenly showing signs of life, of thinking and responding to reality. They're faint signs. Trust me, the people who run it have no interest in changing the Republican Party. They've gotten rich from it. They're pretty happy with their sinecures. Liz Cheney and Mitch McConnell are enraged by the changes. They're content with 2003. They'd like to invade Iraq again. Actually, Mitch McConnell got pretty rich from China, doesn't want that to change, but they're not actually in control of the party. 

The Republican Party is changing and we know that for certain because last night's election results in a couple of primaries show not just new faces, but new ideas. Blake Masters won the  for Senate in the state of Arizona. Candidates like Peter Meijer, for example, in Michigan, the guy who voted to allow men to play in women's sports because he's sensitive, lost. 

In the Republican primary for Arizona's gubernatorial race, Kari Lake has just taken the lead. She's not like your parents' Republican Party. And in the state of Michigan, Tudor Dixon is now the Republican nominee. She will take on Gretchen Whitmer in the fall.

709	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-western-governments-rarely-fight-george-soros-interferes	2022-08-04 23:27:00	Tucker Carlson: Western governments rarely fight back when George Soros interferes | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the power George Soros has all over the world on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

When a Hungarian financier called  shorted the English pound 30 years ago, back in 1992, the British government fought back. It did everything it could to preserve the value of its national currency. British officials raised interest rates all the way to 15%. The Bank of England then sold $40 billion of foreign currency reserves in a desperate effort to prop up the pound. 

In the end, of course, it didn't work. The Bank of England collapsed. Total cost to the population of Great Britain? Well, that's hard to measure, but it was at least 3 billion pounds. This at a time when a pound was worth nearly 2-and-a-half dollars. It's now at $1.20, which tells you a lot. The U.K. got poorer, but not George Soros. His fund made off with a billion dollars in profit — a billion dollars for creating nothing, only destroying things.  

In the years since, Soros has become richer still, billions and billions of dollars richer. George Soros has become so rich that at this point Western governments rarely fight back when he interferes in their most basic domestic affairs, the most important domestic affairs. In 2015, for example, Soros decided that Europe had to resettle millions of penniless refugees from Africa and the Middle East. Relatively few Europeans wanted this to happen at all, but George Soros wanted it.  

So, he spent more than half a billion dollars pushing NGOs and European governments to accept what turned out to be a massive wave of human migration. So, what happened next? What's the second part of the story? Well, there is a humanitarian crisis. That crisis is still going on.  

Life in Europe got much worse. Have you been to Paris lately? You should visit. Violent crime, particularly rapes, skyrocketed and yet European politicians, many of them funded by Soros, refuse to acknowledge it. ""Look away,"" they said. ""This isn't happening. You're crazy or a criminal for noticing."" So, for the past several years, something not-so-different has been happening in our country. George Soros has decided to destroy the American justice system and he's doing it with prosecutors.  

By this point, fully one-in-five Americans, that's more than 70 million people, now live in a jurisdiction overseen by a Soros-backed prosecutor. Soros DAs run cities like New York, Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Los Angeles — our biggest cities. They also run places like Travis County, Texas; Hinds County, Mississippi; Loudoun County, Virginia; Chatham County, Georgia. All of them have Soros-backed prosecutors. 

Soros's influence comes in the form of campaign financing. The money comes from sources, open society foundations and affiliated political action committees and shell companies. A recent analysis by the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund found that in total, more than 75 Soros-backed prosecutors currently hold office in the United States. To get those people in those jobs, Soros has spent more than $40 billion. Often, he's the largest donor in the race. In the race in Philadelphia, for example, 90% of now-DA Larry Krasner's financing came from George Soros. What happened next? Drive through Center City, Philadelphia, sometime and you'll see.

Soros prosecutors refuse to enforce the law against protected groups. That is their signature quality. That's the heart of their ideology. The result of this has been a lot of posturing, but even more murder victims. A lot of people have died. Last year, Philadelphia recorded its highest homicide total in history. Overall, nationally, according to the FBI, homicides in the United States jumped 30% in 2020. That is the largest single-year increase in murders in American history. All because one billionaire decided that laws American citizens voted for and support were racist. Does that sound like democracy to you? Of course, it's not democracy.  

Democracy is a system in which the will of the majority is recognized and often acted upon. The people rule. What we just described is oligarchy. At best, it's grotesque and has killed a lot of people. You're probably aware of this on some level and it's frustrating to hear, but until a few hours ago, no one had really done anything about it, but then today, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a man who, unlike George Soros, has actually been elected by American voters — decided to sack a Soros-backed prosecutor in his state who's been relentlessly politicizing the justice system in Tampa. That man's name is Andrew Warren. For six years, Warren has refused to enforce laws that George Soros doesn't like. Today that ended.  

So, to be clear, in case you missed civics class, prosecutors don't get to make the laws. Prosecutors enforce the laws. They prosecute people for violating the laws. Legislatures make laws. Your representatives are elected by you to write into law the rules that you support. You get to create the parameters of your own society.  

That's called democracy, but when a prosecutor decides which laws are valid and which laws are not, that is the most basic subversion of democracy, and Andrew Warren has done that for six years, and by the list that Gov. DeSantis just read, is just partial. Andrew Warren also decided that he would not enforce HB 1. That's the law that increased penalties for rioters. Warren refused to prosecute 67 BLM rioters in the summer of 2020. He said there had been no breach of the peace in Tampa when there most certainly had been, but he decided to ignore it because he agreed with their politics.  

More recently, Warren declined to prosecute a gang member accused of shooting into a house with children inside after shooting somebody else. Turns out, the gang member was oppressed and of course also likely a Biden voter, so he got a pass. People who aren't Biden voters have had a much tougher time in Andrew Warren's jurisdiction. Sincere Christians, for example. Andrew Warren considers them criminals. Two years ago, Warren had a Tampa pastor arrested for the crime of holding a church service and then he bragged about it.

Ignore the garbage news coverage. What you have here is a pastor arrested for holding a church service. This is the criminal Andrew Warren decided to prosecute, not the gang member shooting into a building with kids inside. No, a Christian minister reading the Bible in public. Now, as ABC told you, that pastor insists he's within his rights, but there's no insisting necessary in this case. It is prima facia true.  

If the First Amendment doesn't protect church services, it doesn't protect anything. Of course, this pastor and all pastors are within their rights to preach. There is no adult debate about that, but Andrew Warren didn't care. He doesn't like pastors like that because pastors like that believe in a power higher than George Soros, so he tried to send that man to jail. Then, in one of the slimiest moments ever caught on videotape, Andrew Warren quoted the Christian gospels to justify this oppression and abuse. It's disgusting.  

It's just disgusting on every level. How dare he. Now you have a law enforcement official telling constituents not to ""hide behind the First Amendment"" by trying to hold church services. That's a right you're born with that cannot be taken away by some Soros-backed prosecutor. Then that same law enforcement official mocks Christians setting the Bible as a justification for suspending religious freedom. So, this is not law enforcement, this is authoritarianism posing as it, and Warren's not the only one.  

Dozens of DAs have been trained to do this in law school and George Soros is funding their campaigns. This is exactly why the nation of Hungary closed a Soros-funded nonprofit in Budapest a few years ago because it was poison, and now that poison is here in the United States. When  was reinstated, to name just one example, Andrew Warren announced he would defy the law, the law passed by voters. His reasoning? He would like his daughter to be able to have abortions.  

Not enough abortions. His daughter, she's crying about it. Who gets to draw the line? We'll actually have an answer to that because it's in the Constitution: Voters get to draw the line. Legislatures elected by voters get to draw the line. Prosecutors do not get to draw the line. If they don't like the line, they can resign and go do something else. Go sell aluminum siding or insurance door-to-door, but they're not allowed to make the laws, but Andrew Warren is not ashamed about any of this. What he is ashamed about is where the money came from that got him elected, the support that he has received from George Soros. 

  

""We think so,"" Warren told a reporter when he was asked if his campaign had received cash from George Soros. ""We understand that he gave money to the state Democratic Party. And the state party money... went to support different candidates. And I've very little insight into the amount of money he gave, who it went to, etc."" 

Oh, but of course that wasn't true, because Warren knew when he said that, that he had been endorsed by one of Soros's many PACs. It was a PAC called the Color of Change PAC. Warren also knew that many of the 67 BLM rioters he let skate back in 2020 in Tampa were affiliated with this same PAC. Do you see how this works? Kind of a snake eating its tail. Soros sends money to Andrew Warren. Then, Andrew Warren refuses to prosecute thugs who are also supported by George Soros. That happened in Tampa but is happening all over the country.  is the man who put an end to it today in the state of Florida.

We've had a few days to reflect on it and have concluded that no honest person could believe that the  last week was a legitimate act of law enforcement. It was not. Even the Biden administration didn't really bother to pretend otherwise. The official explanations that we have heard for the raid make no sense at all. It doesn't matter how forcefully they are repeated by the media, they're nonsensical. In case you've forgotten what they are, here's the very first explanation they gave us. 

Are you listening to this? So, it's not just classified documents in the basement of Mar-a-Lago, but according to Michael Beschloss, the pet historian of the halfwits who run our country, these are ultra-classified documents, the most classified kind, just sitting there helpless in boxes like maidens in bikinis, waiting to be photographed by terrorists. You just imagine al-Qaeda taking selfies with these documents, one after the other relentlessly, repulsive and terrifying. 

Is it true?  At this point, no one has provided proof that it is true, not that august historians like Michael Beschloss wait around for actual evidence before pronouncing final judgment on cable news shows. They just go ahead, but for the sake of argument on our show, we're going to say that it is in fact true and that Donald Trump did, in fact, have boxes of classified documents sitting in his cellar. 

Let's say that's true. What would it mean? Well, what it means depends in part on what the documents were. Did those documents contain meaningful information? Should they have been classified in the first place? Is there a good reason the rest of us should not have been allowed to see those documents? 

Now, you never hear those questions asked in public, but anyone who lives in Washington knows perfectly well they should be asked in public a lot, because in Washington, virtually anything can qualify as an official state secret and often does.  

In 2011, to name one of many examples, the CIA finally declassified a trove of documents from the First World War. These documents dated back to 1917, almost 100 years before. One of these documents, the most ultra-secret of them, contained a recipe for disappearing ink. Now, why would federal bureaucrats spend an entire century hiding an outdated recipe for ink that you can buy legally in any magic store for your fifth grader? Good question. No one asked it. 

Instead, then CIA Director Leon Panetta issued a press release bragging about how he was giving the secret ink recipe to a grateful public. ""These documents remain classified for nearly a century until recent advancements in technology made it possible to release them,"" Panetta wrote. ""When historical information is no longer sensitive, we take seriously our responsibility to share it with the American people."" 

There was no hint whatsoever that Panetta was joking when he wrote that. You're welcome, America. Here's your century-old ink recipe. Again, this was in 2011. So, think it through. You had to wonder what recent technological advancements was Leon Panetta talking about in the press release and just how recent were they? Was Panetta actually saying that CIA spies were still communicating in World War One era disappearing ink as of, say, 2010 or even as of 1950? Please. It was bizarre. Of course, it was another lie from the people in charge.  

Here's the truth. The documents have been classified for 100 years, not because disappearing ink was any sort of national security secret. They'd been classified because the government's default position in every case is that you have no right to see anything ever. It is their information. It is not yours. You're not a citizen. You're just the taxpayer. Shut up and pay for it all. To this day, there are large amounts of classified information remaining from World War II. These are documents written 80 years ago by people whose grandchildren are now old, but you still can't see it. You don't have the clearances. Sorry. 

So, when they tell you that Donald Trump had classified documents in his basement, those materials could be literally anything, but once again, for the sake of argument, we're going to stipulate that Trump did have possession of documents that were classified for some good reason. Documents that, for example, we legitimately would not want the Chinese government to see. If that is true, would it justify what happened? Would it justify sending a large team of federal agents to shut down the entire southern tip of Palm Beach to raid Mar-a-Lago on a weekday? No, it wouldn't. So, one of the laws they're telling you that Trump broke doesn't even have criminal penalties attached to it because it's not serious enough.  

Federal paramilitaries don't show up at your house when you violate the Presidential Records Act and in fact, as we later learned, the actual warrant for the raid, which was signed by an openly partisan judge because you couldn't make any of this up if you tried, once represented Jeffrey Epstein's side in the famous underage sex case, that judge. That judge allowed the FBI to seize virtually every piece of paper in Donald Trump's house, whether or not it had ever been classified.  

They took Roger Stone's clemency order, for example. That had been on the front page of the Washington Post, so was therefore probably not a secret. Apparently, the feds even walked off with Donald Trump's passports preventing him from leaving the country. So, whatever else this raid was, this raid was not about the Presidential Records Act. That explanation is absurd. It's almost as ridiculous as the claim that the White House knew nothing about the raid before it happened. Right. Please. If they're going to lie to us, they ought to try a little harder. So, what was this raid about? Well, we're keeping track. So, here's the second explanation they gave us. 

What! Nuclear secrets? Nuclear secrets are the highest classified status. Ultra-secret nuclear secrets. Donald Trump stole those. Ladies and gentlemen, America is in danger tonight. That was their new explanation for the raid. Now, that revised storyline was leaked anonymously to an obedient press corps, which, as you just saw, repeated every word like it was verifiable fact. 

Once again, no one even bothered to explain what these nuclear secrets might be. What's a nuclear secret exactly and what did Trump plan to do with them? Did he plan to defect to Moscow, give the launch codes to Vladimir Putin, start his own rogue state in the Bahamas? Nobody said, but that didn't stop former CIA director Michael Hayden from suggesting that Donald Trump should be executed, fried to death in the electric chair, for committing these crimes, whatever these crimes were. We still don't know. 

There weren't a lot of facts floating around. There still aren't, but there was a reason for that. They couldn't tell you the whole story. They couldn't release all the documents because that would jeopardize American national security. So instead, you're just going to have to trust them and of course, you're going to have to listen to their outrage. There was a lot of that. There was endless huffing on television about something called the rule of law and how absolutely no one is above that. No one. Not even a former president. 

We're informed of this by the same people who paid rioters to burn down our cities, the ones who eliminated bail, the ones who encouraged tens of millions of foreign nationals to ignore our federal immigration statutes and move to our country permanently at public expense as a reward for breaking our laws, but keep in mind, no one is above the law. That was definitely the word from Joe Scarborough, a man who was accused of committing murder while serving as a member of Congress, yet somehow move seamlessly to the MSNBC lineup without being charged or even investigated. No one is above the law. Remember that. 

So, it was an awful lot of posturing in the days after the raid. But none of it was very effective because again, it didn't make sense. Even propaganda has to add up. Two plus two equals nine doesn't convince anybody.  

Nuclear secrets? If the Biden administration really believed that, if they really thought Donald Trump possessed documents that posed an imminent danger to American national security, then you have to wonder, why did they wait a year and a half to do anything about it? Why did they wait till 90 days before a midterm election, an election that polls suggest they will lose? It doesn't make, oh, wait, actually, it does make sense. 

In fact, the question answers itself. Despite superficial appearances, the raid of Mar-a-Lago was not an act of law enforcement. It was the opposite of that. It was an attack on the rule of law. It was a power grab. As Matt Boose put it recently, in American Greatness, the raid on Trump's home ""was exactly what it looks like, a show of force against the opposition leader by the head of state and his personal bodyguards. If this happened in, any other country would immediately be denounced as the act of a dictator."" 

That's true, but it's hard to hear those words anyway. As an American, you don't want to believe it and yet here are the essential facts. The same week the Biden White House announced that Joe Biden will definitely seek a second term as president, the same week, the Biden Justice Department launched an armed raid against Biden's main rival in that same presidential election. That's what happened. Pause for a minute. If The New York Times told you that something like that was going on in Chad or the Gambia, what would your reaction be? 

You'd probably say to yourself, ""Thank God I don't live in a place like that, a country where politicians used armed men to cling to power."" Oh, but you do live in a country like that. You do. The evidence is all around us. We just don't want to see it. A week to the day after Joe Biden was inaugurated, the FBI arrested a 31-year-old man from Vermont called Douglass Mackey. According to the subsequent DOJ press release, Mackey committed an extremely serious crime. Like Vladimir Putin, he conspired to subvert the 2016 presidential election.  

In a tweet, Mackey had suggested, but not explicitly said, but suggested, that it was possible to vote for Hillary Clinton by text message. This act, proclaimed acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme, was a grave felony, a felony punishable by ten years in prison. Mackey's tweet, DuCharme said, amounted to ""misinformation to defraud citizens of their right to vote."" Assistant FBI Director William Sweeney confirmed that Douglass Mackey had, in fact, committed ""vote theft."" So, as befitting a criminal of this magnitude, Mackey was handcuffed and hauled before a federal judge in Florida called Bruce Reinhart, as it turns out, the same magistrate who authorized last week's raid on Mar-a-Lago. Weird. Then, Mackey was hauled off to jail. 

Now, Mackey's arrest seemed like a significant story, but at the time, media coverage was relatively scant and almost uniformly credulous. The reporters who covered it simply clipped quotes from the DOJ press release and moved on to something else. Why? Well, The New York Times set the tone early by describing Mackey as ""a far-right Twitter troll.""  

""Far-right Twitter troll"" is not a technical term. In fact, it is no agreed upon meaning of any kind. It is slang and slang is something that serious newspapers never include in news stories, but in this case, the term ""far right Twitter troll"" had a use. It sent an unmistakable message to the country and in particular, to the rest of the media and it was this: Douglass Mackey is a dangerous person with unspeakably ugly views.He deserves to be locked up. And so he was.

There was no consideration of the merits of the government's case against Douglass Mackey but there should have been, because the case was absurd. If Mackey's tweets were so threatening to our system of government, toward democracy, then why did the Department of Justice wait more than four years until the week Donald Trump left office to charge him? And if Mackey actually stole the votes of American citizens, as the FBI repeatedly alleged that he did, whose votes were stolen? Who exactly were the victims of Douglas Mackey's crimes? The media never asked. The Biden administration never said.

As of tonight, the Justice Department has never identified a single person who was prevented from voting or from doing anything else by what Douglass Mackey tweeted because there weren't any people. Those people didn't exist.  

Douglass Mackey was not a criminal mastermind running a conspiracy to commit voter fraud. Douglass Mackey was an Internet prankster. His job was to think up funny memes on his laptop in his bedroom. That's what he did. Here's one of his means on the screen hash. ""#DraftOurDaughters,"" Mackey wrote in what was very obviously a fake tweet from the Hillary Clinton campaign.""They are ready to go to war for her. Are you?"" Pretty funny.  

Mackey was mocking Hillary Clinton. No one could miss that. He wasn't subverting elections. He was making fun of the candidate and in fact, no one did miss that. Not a single person in America actually believed that Douglass Mackey’s Twitter memes infringed on ""one of the most basic and sacred rights guaranteed by the Constitution, the right to vote."" Absolutely no one believed that. No one could believe that because it's too stupid a claim to believe and yet Nicholas McQuaid, who went to Columbia Law School and is now Joe Biden's assistant attorney general, made that claim anyway verbatim and did so with a straight face, "" Douglass Mackey is a threat to democracy."" So, he faces ten years in prison. The DOJ press release said.  

That three paragraphs later, the same press release inadvertently acknowledged what was actually going on. In the run up to the 2016 election, the DOJ explained, Douglass Mackey had gained more influence on Twitter than either NBC News or (gasp) Stephen Colbert himself. Now the criminal complaint against Douglass Mackey actually spells that. You can read it for yourself. It's still online.

The Biden administration argued that on Twitter, people liked Douglass Mackey more than they liked NBC News or Stephen Colbert and they may not seem bad to you. It may seem fine having grown up as you did in a country where people were allowed to choose what they read, but according to the government Joe Biden now runs, that's a felony.

Now you don't have to be a right-winger to find that terrifying. In a free country, you have an absolute right to say what you think in public, period, doesn't matter who is offended by what you say. It doesn't matter if people consider your views ugly. Even if every person on the planet finds your opinions horrifying and beyond the pale, you still have the right to express them because you were born with that right. It's inherent. You cannot be sent to prison for your political views ever. That is the core principle of the United States. That is the principle that Marines fought their way to the top of Mount Suribachi to protect.  

So, whatever you think of his means, Douglass Mackey’s freedom of speech was very much worth defending, but virtually nobody defended it. Aside from a few brave and honorable exceptions, even so-called conservative media stayed silent as Douglass Mackey’s life was destroyed by the Biden Justice Department. He's still in limbo, facing ten years. Why? Well, because The New York Times had called him a far-right Twitter troll and no respectable person wanted to be anywhere near that. So, the purge continued. 

Douglass Mackey may have been the first victim of the new authoritarianism, but he was hardly the last one. Over the last 18 months, virtually every significant figure in the orbiter at Donald Trump has been swept up by Merrick Garland at Department of Justice. Their homes raided, their personal communications seized and leaked to the media. Some have been arrested and thrown in jail. Donald Trump's lawyers are the primary targets. Today, the DOJ subpoenaed Eric Herschmann. He represented Trump during the first impeachment. Herschmann never worked in the White House counsel's office.  

The Biden administration is going after him anyway because he gave legal advice to his client, Donald Trump. That used to be allowed. People used to be allowed to have lawyers and speak to them privately, but it's not allowed anymore. That's what the CIA seized attorney client records from Mar-a-Lago. It's also why the DOJ is now directly targeting Trump's most prominent personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. For years, the feds have been going after Giuliani's associates, including a man called George Dickson. Dickson was working on a documentary about Hunter Biden. Last year, the FBI raided his home in California. The feds also broke into Giuliani's own apartment, as well as his office in New York. Then the FBI targeted a Giuliani associate called Igor Fruman because he dug up evidence of misconduct by Joe Biden in Ukraine. They sent Fruman to prison.  

Then the FBI seized the phone of prominent conservative attorney Victoria Toensing. She'd worked with Giuliani in 2020 to investigate election fraud. They raided her home. Today, the DOJ announced that Giuliani himself is a target of a federal investigation. Why exactly? Well, because like Toensing and so many others who were now under investigation or under arrest, Giuliani questioned the 2020 election outcome, in this case, in the state of Georgia. Really? Questioning the election outcome in the state of Georgia? Isn't that something Stacey Abrams has made a career of doing? Yes, but Republicans no longer have that right. 

Not long ago, more than a dozen federal agents swooped in for a pre-dawn raid on former Trump official Jeff Clark. They left him on the street in his underwear for maximum humiliation. Then they seized John Eastman's phone. Eastman was also a Trump attorney. He was approached by six agents at a restaurant in New Mexico while leaving dinner with his wife. They patted him down and forced him to provide facial biometric data to unlock his phone. Then the DOJ tried the same thing with Steve Bannon's lawyer, Bob Costello, trying to force him to surrender his privileged phone and email records. We could go on and on and on. The point is, all of this is illegal. It violates the First Amendment and violates long-established attorney-client privilege, but it's happening right in front of us a lot.  

The FBI has shackled former Trump official Peter Navarro as he was boarding a flight at Reagan National Airport. He was handcuffed, denied food and water, refused permission to make a phone call to his lawyer. Then because that wasn't terrifying enough, Biden's FBI went after a sitting congressman perceived as too close to Trump. His name was Congressman Scott Perry. A day after the Mar-a-Lago raid, the feds seized Congressman Perry's phone while he was traveling with his family. They could have called his lawyer and set up something. They didn't bother. That just nabbed him in front of his family and these are the prominent victims of this crackdown on civil liberties being conducted by the Biden administration.  

Of course, in the wake of the January 6 election justice protests, more than 900 people have been arrested and charged with crimes arising from that day, 900, almost all of them nonviolent, almost all of them with no previous criminal record. More than 50 of them have been sentenced to prison so far, including one with terminal cancer. Her crime? Walking around the Capitol building for a few minutes and that's just the beginning. There are another 500 cases to go. In fact, the DOJ is getting under $34 million, another 130 more employees, just to handle all those cases from January 6, from the election justice protests, which is what they were. Now, superficially, all of this is about Donald Trump and on some level, it is. Permanent Washington does not want Trump to run again. Of course, it's their greatest fear and they're doing all he can to prevent it. 

It turns out democracy is too important to let voters choose their own president, but if you take three steps back and consider what's actually going on, you'll see that none of this is really about Donald Trump, the man. It's about power and that means it's about crushing and humiliating anyone who gets in the way of people who want to retain power and that means anyone. How about Alex Berenson? Alex Berenson is a novelist and former New York Times reporter. He's got an Ivy League degree, lives in the Northeast. In no way does Alex Berenson fit the profile of your average Trump voter. Certainly not the stereotype.  

In fact, it's hard to believe that he voted for Donald Trump. We don't know and it doesn't matter. We do know that when Alex Berenson started to post fact-based challenges to the lies Joe Biden was telling about COVID and then the COVID vaccines, the White House commanded Twitter to silence Alex Berenson and Twitter soon did that and we're not speculating about what happened. There are written exchanges that prove what happened. We're going to talk to Alex Berenson in a minute about the details, but the point is, this is illegal. No American government is allowed to collude with private business to silence its critics. Period. That is an unambiguous violation of the First Amendment. It's also a violation, of course, of Alex Brunson's human rights, and yet somehow this slipped beneath notice. The New York Times didn't write about it. Why would they? On some level, you understand because what happened to Alex Berenson has happened to many, many, many critics of the Biden administration in the past year and a half. They have been censored. They have been silenced at the direction of the White House. 

Think about what this means. These are acts of aggression and hostility aimed at Americans. No American president has ever done this. No American president has ever explicitly declared war on his own population and yet for the Biden administration, it's a near weekly occurrence. Here's Joe Biden and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, telling you that White supremacists, in other words, Trump voters, because that's what they mean when they say White supremacists, a term they've never defined, White supremacist Trump voters are the single greatest terror threat the United States faces. 

So, not to be too literal, but this is on some level a news show, that's a lie. None of what you heard is true. There's not a single statistic or piece of credible research to support what Biden or his attorney general just said. Again, all of it is a lie. The truth, as usual, is the opposite. These are the people who created the crime wave America is suffering under and now they're blaming you for it and for good measure, they're disarming you because you cannot be trusted with guns because you're too dangerous and just in case you missed the theme here, they're hiring another 87,000 armed IRS agents just to make sure that you obey. Got it? Got it? Is it clear? Amazingly, some Republican leaders still don't get it or pretend they don't get it. Here's Asa Hutchinson, still somehow the governor of Arkansas in a holding pattern before he transitions to the Wal-Mart board, assuring that the FBI is completely on the level.  

  

Oh, the FBI is just simply carrying out their responsibilities. Of course, they are. ""What? Well you don't support law enforcement? There's nothing to see here."" That's the line and no doubt Asa Hutchinson and Mitch McConnell and Dan Crenshaw and the rest of them will be telling you the very same thing when the Biden Justice Department or some other state law enforcement agency under their influence finally does what you know they're going to do, which is indict Donald Trump. Obviously, they're going to do that. Who knows how.  

Maybe they'll produce surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Apparently, they've already subpoenaed that and we'll spend the next year talking about how it shows Trump mishandling classified information. Really? On the server. Remember the endless Russia collusion hoax? We're in for a lot more of that. They will scream about how Trump is a criminal and if you express any support for him or any interest in retaining, I don't know, the rights of free speech and due process, you're a criminal, too. In fact, you are the threat. You're the threat and just mentioning you disagree with what is happening is an attack on our government. That's their style. 

Just the other day, after signing off on , your Attorney General, Merrick Garland, came on stage to whine about how actually he was the victim here. He's the victim. Apparently, some people disagreed with the raid, so the FBI, the most heavily armed domestic law enforcement agency in the world, is now under threat from you. Right. You're the criminal. Our critics are in jail, but I got anonymous threats on Twitter. Poor me. Passive aggression is the defining characteristic of the left. If they started putting people in camps, NBC News would cheer them on and then attack you for complaining about it. ""How dare you, violating our norms. We've always had camps."" 

As if to prove it, they prove it every day, but in the hours after Mar-a-Lago raid, the usual jackals on Twitter, begin demanding that Donald Trump should release the warrant that justified the raid. ""If you're not guilty, you'll show it to us,"" that's what they said. So, Trump did it. He gave the warrant to Breitbart News, which printed it, and then the second to Breitbart piece went up, the very same jackals start screaming about how far right-wing extremist are putting the lives of FBI agents in danger since those agents were named in the warrant, which is a public document. In other words, ""We're the victims here. We're the victims."" 

It's always the same, except this time, unfortunately, it could be a little different. Indicting Donald Trump is a very big step, not simply because a lot of people like him and he's the former president, but because indicting him at this point would be to reveal that this entire thing and by thing we mean our justice system is just transparently political. It's just a means to an end, a means to power and people know that at this point. They've watched it. They understand what's happening. Even people who don't like Donald Trump, even people who didn't vote for Donald Trump and don't want to vote for him in 2024, they know and they can't unknow. And that means that we are at this point on the edge of something unprecedented and something awful. You could feel it. Even Donald Trump feels it. 

Maybe for the first time in his life,  seems sincerely interested in lowering the temperature, not just for his own sake, but for the country. He said that. He's never said anything like that. Maybe he doesn't mean it, but when has he ever said that? ""Let's all calm down a little,"" he said the other day. ""This isn't good."" Yeah, he's right.  

It's not good and not just for him, for all of us. This could get very bad, very fast and the Biden people know that perfectly well. They know what could happen if they continue down this path of using law enforcement to cling to power. But they don't care because they're facing a repudiation from voters and they're desperate and they'll do anything but at what cost? Pray they pull back before it's too late.

711	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-inflation-reduction-act-classic-case-misinformation	2022-08-17 22:31:00	Tucker Carlson: Inflation Reduction Act may be a classic case of misinformation | Fox News	"'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host breaks down the deceit in Democrats' $740 billion legislation that will not bring down inflation. 

People say the federal government seems big, maybe bigger than ever. Well, it actually is the largest employer in the world. The federal government, nothing else comes close—not Google, not Amazon, not the Communist Party of China, nothing. How many people work for the United States government? Let's put it this way. There are more than 100 countries around the world whose total populations (that is, every man, woman and child) are smaller than our federal workforce—entire countries, many of them.  

The U.S. government, in other words, is astoundingly large, world historically big, scale without precedent, truly gargantuan. So, what do all those people who work there do every day? You may be wondering that. Well, it's a good question. Actually, nobody's really sure, including many of the employees themselves. Fundamentally, the federal government is a mystery. Like the universe, it goes on forever. It makes you feel small thinking about it, which is probably the point. 

The good news is, every once in a while, our government does something you can actually understand. That happened recently when Joe Biden signed a $750 billion piece of legislation called the . What does the Inflation Reduction Act do? Come on, what are you, slow? The answer is right there in the name. The Inflation Reduction Act is an act that reduces inflation. It's an inflation-reducing act and that's welcome news because inflation is indeed a problem. In fact, voters say it's the problem they worry about most.  

So, Congress has decided to reduce it. That's how things work in Washington. You would identify a crisis, and then you pass a law making it illegal. Crisis solved. It's simple. Getting too hot for you in the summer? No problem, just have Congress write a law banning high temperatures. That's effectively our climate change policy and as we know, it works. The science on that has been settled. Don't deny it. Now, Congress has decided to bring that very same approach to inflation. Just command it to go down.  

You can imagine how terrified inflation will be when it discovers it's being reduced by our all-powerful Congress. ""Wait,"" it'll say in horror, ""You passed an Inflation Reduction Act? Okay, fine. I surrender. Gas is now $1.50 a gallon. Hamburgers, two bucks a pound. Sorry for the high prices."" That's the promise of this act anyway, but in real life, a lot of people are still wondering, ""How is this going to work?"" 

Hilary Vaughn from Fox was wondering that, so yesterday she caught up with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin is the man, the single man whose vote made this bill possible. ""Is the Inflation Reduction Act really going to reduce inflation?"" she asked. Here's how Joe Manchin responded:

So, as Hillary Vaughn pointed out correctly the law won't immediately make anything cheaper to buy. In other words, it will not , but Joe Manchin didn't deny this. He didn't seem bothered by it. In fact, his response was, ""Why would it?"" Well, let's see, because you told us it would, you dishonest little creep, and then you printed another $750 billion of fake money, which is exactly the habit that caused historic inflation in the first place, all this fake money printing.

 So, what's the upside of this bill exactly? Joe Manchin didn't say. Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland couldn't explain it either. Watch this.  

""I'm Jamie Raskin. I'll say anything."" 

""What parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will actually reduce inflation?"" 

""Next question,"" says Raskin. He actually said that out loud, as you just saw. In other words, ""You've caught me lying and I don't even care. Go away, peasant."" So, as it turns out, we hate to break this to you, the Inflation Reduction Act may be a classic example of misinformation. Imagine buying a bottle labeled ""shampoo"" and finding out the hard way it was actually drain cleaner. It's like that. So, if there's one thing we can learn from the so-called , it's that in Washington, words no longer have any meaning at all. 

The empire has officially entered its postmodern phase, where there's no connection whatsoever between the sounds that emerge from the mouths of our leaders and observable physical reality. Congress might as well have called this the Eternal Happiness Act. And why not? That's probably the name of the next bill Joe Biden signs and we hope so, because we are long overdue for Washington to ban sadness. They ought to get on that, not that this bill was even thought about by Joe Biden, not that he even noticed this bill. Biden doesn't get too caught up in the meaning of words these days. Biden is definitively post-literate at this point. Here was the scene as he signed his most recent legislative triumph. 

Here we go. They might as well put a sign on his desk saying, ""This guy has no idea what he's doing right now"" because he didn't and it couldn't have been more obvious. The thousand-yard stare was the giveaway. There were doughboys in Verdun who looked less shell shocked than Biden just did, but the question remained, ""What was in the bill?"" Well, let's see. You'll be happy to know that this bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, includes $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to buy new electric mail trucks.  

So, why would your mailman need an electric mail truck? No one has ever explained that, but your mailman is getting one and China is getting even richer from the electric mail truck batteries, which it makes. So, there's that. Then there's another $3 billion allocated to block grants for something called environmental justice that will be overseen by the EPA, which used to look after the environment, but now it's in the justice business. Environmental justice gets about $60 billion in this legislation, which is great if you're in the environmental justice business, but it leaves the rest of us wondering, ""What is environmental justice actually?""  

Well, according to the bill, it means and we are quoting here, ""facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in state and federal advisory groups, workshops, rulemaking and other public processes."" OK. That sounds confusing, but also expensive. In all, the EPA alone gets more than $40 billion in this bill, including more than $30 billion for so-called disadvantaged communities. What are those? Well, they're not really defined, people who vote for Joe Biden. So, what it really means is the EPA is going to spread more identity politics and race hate. Are you sick of that yet? The Biden White House is not sick of it. They're all in.  

For context, to show you just how all in they are on that, the total annual budget of the EPA currently stands at about $10 billion. So, this is a lot of money flowing to equity and the disadvantaged and of course, everything hangs on definitions. So, who gets to define what disadvantages, a disadvantaged community? Well, that would be the EPA's administrator, a guy called Michael Regan, 

This is a guy who's in his late forties who has never had an actual job in his life, never worked for real business of any kind, but he does have priorities and to give you some sense of what they are, we'll tell you what he told The Daily Show this year and we're quoting, ""Everything I do at EPA is through the lens of environmental justice, contracting, procurement, air quality, water quality, land management, starts with 'Are we protecting the least among us, those who have lacked political representation and those who have not been at the table for decades’?"" 

So really, this is about spreading race hate as virtually everything they do is. They call it equity. It's not about protecting the environment and if you're wondering how the environment's doing, take a very close look.Is anyone monitoring the chemicals in our water? No. We're busy conducting workshops for billions of dollars with disadvantaged communities. Right. That may not be helping the environment, but it's definitely not reducing inflation.  

Inflation reduction is not the same as protecting people who lack political representation. That's, of course, Joe Biden's base, the 81 million who voted for him. That's what this bill is really about, rewarding his voters. That would include virtually every bureaucrat in Washington. They do very well on this bill, of course, as long as they promise to spend it on equity, however, they want to define that.  

There's $25 million for the Government Accountability Office to determine, ""whether the economic, social and environmental impacts of the funds described in this paragraph are equitable."" The bill also calls for $10 million to be spent on ""equity commissions"" within the Department of Agriculture to combat racism. In other words, to commit racism. Really, not since the German government 80 years ago has any government ever pay closer attention to people's genetics. That's true and yet no one notices it for some reason. Well, we do.  

There's more than $2 billion for the General Services Administration. Something called the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, that gets $350 million. The Bureau of Indian Affairs gets $220 million. The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations gets $23 million and it's not just bureaucrats who are getting paid. There are billions of dollars in new tax credits. Who do those go to? Joe Biden's donors. Of course, not to you. Are you in private equity? No, you're not, so you don't get anything. Biden described these credits yesterday.  

So, you watch that and you realize maybe they are going to run him again because he doesn't actually exist. He is merely a conduit through which they change America. He has no idea what he's saying. He reads the script. He seems kind of non-threatening and out of it. That may seem embarrassing to you, a problem to you. You wonder, ""What does his wife think of all this? It's so demeaning and degrading. It's cruel to do this to a guy, feed him full of drugs and having read someone else's script,"" but if you're trying to change the country really fast, this is very useful to you, so of course, they're going to run him again.  

So, again to the bill, a nonprofit called Rewiring America, which supports this bill, decided to figure out how much money Americans are eligible to receive from the Inflation Reduction Act based on zip code, household income, tax filing status. So, according to Rewiring America, a married couple with one child in San Francisco earning the median household income there of $120,000 would be eligible for nearly $12,000 in tax credits, but according to that same group, that same family of three making the median income in Youngstown, Ohio, for example, would be eligible for just $81 in tax credits. Oh, that's weird. So, the middle-class kid shafted while people making 120 grand in San Francisco make out. OK.  

So, most Americans who are making middle-class wages will be eligible for more savings only if they're willing to go out and spend thousands of dollars on things like a new heat pump water heater, an electric stove or a heat pump closed dryer. Right, none of which work very well, but the bigger issue is that all these tax credits for Joe Biden's base are going to increase inflation. This is the same thing that happened to college tuition when the government subsidized it. It got much more expensive. Perfect, and that's already started. As The Washington Examiner has reported, electric vehicle manufacturers are now raising the price of their cars now that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act includes a $770,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, ""Ahead of the Inflation Reduction Act, extending the tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchases of new electric and hybrid vehicles, Ford and GM announced price increases at similar rates."" You following this?  

So, the government pays you back your own money to buy a product and then the manufacturer of the product raises the cost of that same product by the same amount. Oh, so it's a subsidy for them, not savings for you. ""Last week, Ford announced price hikes between $6,000 and $8,500 for most of its lineup of its F-150 lightning electric vehicles, while General Motors upped its electric Hummer costs by $6,250 last month."" 

So, what does that? They don't want to answer the question because the only potentially deflationary aspect of this bill is the tax increase, which is, of course, probably not a good idea when you're in a recession, but our government is not willing to cut spending and stop printing money, so instead their solution is to take money from you. This is classic, right? So, you print all the money you want because you hold the reserve currency and then when inflation goes up, you just try and pull it out of the system through taxation. That's modern monetary theory. Look it up. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this act will cost the middle-class $20 billion a year in new taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded that under this bill, 61% of taxpayers make between $40,000 and $50,00 will see a tax increase.  

91% of Americans make between $75,000 and $100,000 will see their taxes go up and 97% of Americans make between $100,000 and $200,000 will see their taxes go up. So, if you're making 100 grand in Arlington, Virginia, are you rich? Oh, no. You're barely scraping by. So, it turns out that Biden was lying. Just yesterday, he told us that no one making under $400,000 a year will see their taxes go up. Watch. 

Yeah. Not a penny more. I mean, again, you can't blame the guy. He's just a mannequin, but whoever wrote that knew he was lying. There is one group of Americans who will not pay more under that bill and that's Biden's donors, the richest people in the country. Thanks to the Democratic Party's hedge fund support, and they have a lot of that, the private equity world, the final revision of this bill keeps the carried interest loophole in our tax code. That means that people who work in finance, many parts of finance, are able to report their income as interest and pay half the taxes that you do. No one can defend this policy. It is indefensible. Even the people who benefit from it will not defend it. They're embarrassed of it. They take advantage of it, of course, but it's a scam and everybody knows it and yet it remains in our tax code because they paid off the Democratic senator from Arizona and a bunch of others.  

So, just in case the message wasn't clear, the bill gives the IRS another $80 billion to hire 87,000 new auditors. So, what are those new auditors, those armed auditors of the IRS have to do with a tax code this unfair? Well, the truth is, if you have a tax code this unfair and it keeps getting more unfair every year, you have to hire armed goons to make people obey because they won't otherwise. 87,000 new armed IRS agents. How many is that? Well, for perspective, the IRS currently has about 78,000 total. So, this bill will make the IRS larger than the army of the nation of Italy, also the nation of the Philippines, also the U.K.. What? Thanks, Joe Manchin. 

So, what are those agents going to be doing? We're not sure, but we do have an IRS training video for you. Watch.  

So, in an actual democracy, IRS agents should be taught to be polite, but under Joe Biden, IRS agents are taught ""to shoot."" How is that not war on the population of the country?

For all the bad things going on, there are, on the other side, , which are a nonstop source of joy for us. And if you've seen them recently, you know in your heart exactly how the November elections are going to turn out. Biden's obviously been a disaster for the country, but not only has he made the U.S. poorer, weaker and much more ridiculous, people know that he has, and they tell pollsters about it all the time. Biden is the single least popular president in modern American history. 

At this point, absolutely nobody is impressed by Joe Biden and that would be including Dr. Jill. So, this is a big problem for the Biden family, obviously, but a much bigger problem even for the , which Joe Biden leads. Unpopular presidents drag their parties to the bottom in midterm elections. That's the unchanging rule of politics. You saw it famously in 1994 with the Republican takeover of Congress after two disastrous years of Bill Clinton. You saw it in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina. You saw it in 2010 after ObamaCare. You saw it in 2018.  

So, there's no question based on precedent that that's about to happen once again in 2022, in November. That's what everybody assumes and in fact, it may well happen. We're certainly praying for it, but as of tonight, we have to be honest with you, the numbers don't show that happening. Not even close. In fact, all the indications we have right now suggest that despite Joe Biden's well-earned unpopularity, the Democratic Party still, again, as of tonight, has a strong chance of holding Congress in November.  

The prediction markets, which many believe are more accurate than the polls, overwhelmingly point to the Democrats keeping at least one chamber and maybe strangest of all, as of this week, Democrats are leading Republicans nationally in the so-called generic ballot by about four points. So, if you ask people, ""Which party do you like more?"" they say Democrats. And maybe that's why Democrats are raising a lot more money, too and not just money from their patrons in big tech, but from smalldollar donors. That's bad.  

In June, Democrats raised $64 million online from 4 million people. That same month, this June, Republicans raised only $26 million online from just over a million donors. From the first quarter to the second quarter of this year, donations to the Republican Party dropped by more than 12%. By contrast, donations to the Democratic Party are up more than 20%. That is not good at all, not simply because you need money to run a political campaign, but because money is, to some extent, a measure of commitment and intensity and you see the same dynamic playing out in individual races across the country.  

For example, last quarter, Raphael Warnock, that would be the thoroughly mediocre Democratic senator from Georgia, the guy who was caught on video appearing to commit spousal abuse (Remember that?) that guy raised more than $12 million online. His opponent, Herschel Walker, who everyone likes, raised less than half of that. So far, Raphael Warnock has raised an astounding amount of money. He's hauled in more dollars online than seven Republican senatorial candidates combined: Candidates in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin and Georgia combined.  

Herschel Walker is now trailing Raphael Warnock by ten points and this is happening in a state they tell us went for Joe Biden by a margin of about one-third of a percentage point. That is bizarre. What is going on here? 

It's not just happening in Georgia. According to the official numbers, you'll recall, Joe Biden won the state of Pennsylvania by a little over a single percentage point in 2020. So, it's been two years. Biden has become much less popular since then. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania, which is controlled by the Democratic Party, has become much worse, far more chaotic and dangerous. Here is the scene in the state's largest city on Tuesday.  

Over 100 shots right in the middle of the street. It's hard to believe that's an American city. It's hard to believe that's the place where our Constitution was written. It's totally unacceptable, and it wasn't organic. It didn't just happen. This is a result of policies from the Democratic Party. Period. Now, you'd think this being a democracy, that voters would punish anyone who had anything to do with turning Philadelphia into the disaster you just saw and John Fetterman certainly did have a hand in that. He's the sitting lieutenant governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Fetterman now wants a new job. He's running for the U.S. Senate. He's the candidate. In some ways, John Fetterman is the weakest possible candidate you could run. He has obviously a very public record of failure. He also had a devastating stroke this spring, which is sad, but it affected him. Here he is campaigning for Senate:

  

So, this guy is everything you'd think wouldn't work. He's radical, for one thing. ""Let's eliminate the filibuster."" Oh, good idea, John Fetterman. He's implicated in the destruction of the state that he's still a lieutenant governor of and he's obviously impaired. That's not an attack on him. It's just true. Watch him. So, you'd think there would be no way a guy like that could win a Senate seat and here's the sad news, however, John Fetterman is winning overwhelmingly. He currently has a double-digit lead over his Republican opponent Mehmet Oz, Dr. Oz. The National Republican Senatorial Committee just slashed its spending in the state of Pennsylvania by more than $5 million, including their ad buys in the city of Philadelphia. That's a retreat, and it's happening in a state the Republicans ought to be winning.  

What is going on here, and why is no one mentioning it? Well, a couple of things are going on, but first, let's hear from Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell is the head Republican in the Senate. He's not there because everyone likes him. McConnell has no close friends. He's loved by no one, but he's considered very smart. He's a master tactician as the dummies who cover politics for Politico and The Washington Post are always telling us. In Washington, people are very much afraid of Mitch McConnell. Cross him and he will hurt you and they listen carefully to his political analysis because that's what he's spent his life doing. That's the only thing he spent his life doing. So, here's what Mitch McConnell says the problem is. Watch.  

So, there's the head Republican in the Senate conceding three months out that Republicans are probably not going to retake the Senate. Why is that? Well, the answer, of course, is in the final line you just heard. Some of the candidates are mediocre. That's Mitch McConnell's excuse and there's some truth in that. Obviously, some of them are mediocre, but compared to what? Mediocre in the Congress. Well, let's see. Dianne Feinstein hasn't spoken a coherent sentence in years, hasn't had trouble getting reelected. Eric Swalwell had sex with a Chinese spy. He's still there. So, mediocre people get elected to office, lots and lots and lots of them do every cycle. So, what McConnell's analysis really is, of course, is buck-passing. Don't blame me. I didn't choose these people. All right, but they're still the nominees.  

So, if you want to save the country and move in a different direction, yes using some mediocre people to do it, what are you going to do? No hint of what you might do for Mitch McConnell other than just accept the inevitable. Now, the truth is, it's entirely possible Mitch McConnell doesn't want to retake the Senate because then you'd have to run things and there's one thing Republican leaders dislike. It's running anything, much easier to complain on Fox News, but if you actually wanted to win, what would you do? Well, here's an idea just kind of out of nowhere. Just spitballing here. How about you run on issues that voters care about? That might work even for a mediocre candidate. 

So, let's say again, just for the sake of argument that you ran a campaign on . Now, these are two issues that didn't just arise out of nowhere. They're the product of policies the Democratic Party put in. They were intentional outcomes. We have millions of people coming in illegally and we have a lot more murders than we had two years ago. These two issues, immigration and crime, don't simply annoy voters, though they very much do. These two issues threaten the existence of our society. So, maybe you should run on them. That seems reasonable, but that's not what they're doing. Oh, no. Here, for example, is a recent campaign ad from Dr. Oz. He's the guy who's losing to the stroke victim in Pennsylvania. Watch. 

$20 for crudités, whatever that is. It's obviously very easy to make fun of that, but it's not entirely a stupid ad if inflation were the salient issue here, the generational issue of this campaign season, but it's not. Inflation is terrible. It's making people poorer. We actually could tank the U.S. dollar. These are all big, big problems, but changing the population of the United States, allowing people to be murdered in the street, letting drug addicts live on the sidewalk and sending them crack pipes that will change everything forever. These are offenses against the most basic rules of any civilization and the most basic of all is you reward people for doing the right thing and you penalize them for doing the wrong thing. If you start doing the opposite, then everything falls apart and everybody knows that.  

So, why not just say it? Why don't you say that? Don't be embarrassed. Just say that. If you live in Texas, for example, supposedly a conservative state, you don't even have police protection anymore. That's how quickly things have changed on the most basic level. That's not some report from a government agency telling you what the inflation rate is. That's your life. You don't have police protection anymore. If there's one reason to run for office, it's to fix things like that. Here's Fox reporter Madison Alworth describing it.  

Okay, crudités is 20 bucks. Got it, but that's more important than everything else that's going on right now. Law and Order. You see it on the streets of our cities. You see it at our southern border. It's collapsed. So, if you're a Republican voter and not just a Republican voter, any voter, you probably want to know what is the government going to do about the fact that I can call 911 and no one shows up? What are you going to do about the fact that our border is open to the world and that millions of them have come in illegally? How can you take the country seriously when it doesn't even have a border? And it doesn't, and we know that because on video, every single day people stream in. Fox's Bill Mulligan just caught the whole thing once again on camera. 

So, if every Republican candidate just repeated, repeat after me, ""law enforcement, law and order is not racist. Law and order is a prerequisite for civilization, and if it goes away, so does the country,"" you would win the votes not simply of your own voters, but of a lot of other voters and people who have never voted before and any normal Democrat would agree with that because it's inherently true, but is the opposite of what we have. When Ann Coulter saw the video we just played, she noted correctly that it's easier to get into this country as an illegal alien than it is to return as an American citizen back into JFK. By the way, the people you saw are the ones who just want to be caught. They're turning themselves into the bus to your town. There is a lot of people who don't want to be caught, and those people are bringing in fentanyl, which is killing thousands of Americans every month. 

-  

Everybody knows this is happening. This is not hidden information. These are not the Gnostic gospels. Every American citizen knows exactly what's happening and yet the leader of the Republican Party, Mitch McConnell, will watch footage like that and tell you, no, that most important issue that we face: territorial integrity of Ukraine and in the same breath, they will tell you there is nothing the Republican Party can do to avert historic humiliation in the . But the truth, as you well know, is that the people who run the Republican Party don't actually want to do anything about it. 

There are candidates who are talking about the stuff—J.D. Vance in Ohio, Blake Masters in Arizona, Joe Kent in the Pacific Northwest. The leaders of the Republican Party in Washington would rather those guys lose and people like them lose than change the focus of the party to issues that voters actually care about. But the truth is, you can't win elections unless you listen to voters. They're telling you what they want. Republicans have less than three months to figure this very simple riddle out, or it's going to be an actual disaster.

713	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-fauci-answer-for	2022-08-22 22:29:00	Tucker Carlson: Fauci has a lot to answer for | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on Dr. Fauci's handling of the coronavirus pandemic on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Imagine the pandemonium at SoulCycle studios across the Northeast this morning when . Ugly doesn't begin to describe it. Picture the chaos, if you can, in the organic chaga aisle at Whole Foods in Brooklyn. Try to envision the panic and hysteria that must have broken out at espresso bars in Edgartown and Aspen and Santa Monica and Bethesda as thousands of masked ladies in Lululemon discovered, all at once, that the one religious leader they still revered, their own even tinier version of the Dalai Lama, had decided to retreat forever from public life. 

It was, ladies and gentlemen, the equivalent of a targeted nuclear device detonated over the most emotionally vulnerable elements of our most privileged population. You can picture the carnage, the wailing, the swooning, manicured hands clutched to breasts, then fumbling for Xanax and expensive handbags. Not since the orange man seized the White House in a Russian coup have more 46-year-old Cornell-educated lawyers with weak husbands wept shamelessly in public.  

There's not enough rosé in Napa to quell that pain and it wasn't supposed to be this way. It never is supposed to be this way. Just a month ago, Saint Tony suggested to his followers he'd be around another two years, at least, living at public expense as the highest paid federal employee until the end of Joe Biden's first, but hopefully not last, term and you know what that meant. 

It meant many more spreads in Teen Vogue, many more interviews on NPR, many more tips on masking (Is three enough?) and of course, more vital guidance on how to celebrate the holidays. Which relatives should be banned from Thanksgiving this year? Dr. Fauci will know. Oh, but not anymore. That's all gone. He's sitting masked at Brian Stelter's house watching Chris Hayes tonight because this morning, Tony Fauci announced his abdication.  

""I will be leaving these positions,"" It was always more than one, ""I'll be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue my next chapter of my career,"" he said. The next chapter of his career? He's only 81. Some of us had hoped he'd be around another 40 years, but he's leaving so soon, too soon. Why? What's going on here? You hate to think politics could affect Tony Fauci's judgment as a scientist.  

They never have before, but is it possible this thoroughly nonpartisan man of medicine has thought about what might happen in November when the Republican Congress takes over? Does he believe that could be bad news for him? Well, yes, it is possible he believes that because on some level, even Tony Fauci knows that Tony Fauci is, in fact, a dangerous fraud, a man who has done things that in most countries, at most times in history, would be understood perfectly clearly to be very serious crimes. So, it's possible that Tony Fauci might want to resign before he has to explain all of that to a new Congress.  

He might want to get out of town now and move to, say, Cambridge, find a safe place to hide before the reckoning. Just a thought because honestly, there's a lot to answer for. In just the last two years, Fauci's recommended treatments and preventative measures for COVID that not only didn't work, but that he knew didn't work. He admitted to the New York Times that he lied about herd immunity in order to sell more vaccines, which also didn't work, which weren't even actually vaccines, but they did hurt a lot of people, tens of thousands.  

Then he lied about masks publicly. ""You should wear one as you're riding a bike, you're getting too much life enhancing oxygen. What you really need is more carbon dioxide. Be more like a tree."" That's what he was saying in public, but in private, he wrote that ""The typical mask you buy at a drug store is not really effective at keeping out a virus."" Oh, so he knew. As your kids were suffocating during gym wearing a mask, Tony Fauci knew they didn't work and then there's this, maybe his most notable crime. He didn't simply downplay and obfuscate the origins of the pandemic, apparently in conjunction with the Chinese government. No. Tony Fauci covered up evidence that he, Tony Fauci, helped create that virus in the first place. Here's Tony Fauci last July, testifying under oath before the Congress.  

Oh. Dr. Fauci meets an actual doctor who's not a BS artist who asks simple questions and demands straightforward answers. Tony Fauci was lying in that clip. He knew he was lying. As the Intercept, of all places, recently reported, ""Scientists working under a 2014 NIH grant to the EcoHealth Alliance to study bat coronaviruses combined the genetic material from a parent coronavirus known as WIV1 with other viruses."" Oh, they were manufacturing more powerful viruses. Tony Fauci oversaw that. 

Then, the Intercept spoke to several virologists and found that, ""seven said that the work appears to meet NIH's criteria for gain-of-function research."" Ok, , that was going on. Not allowed in this country, so they were offshoring it in their various labs, including one owned by the Chinese government, a lot of biolabs in Ukraine. What was going on there? Oh, shut up. Don't ask. You're working for Putin. Really? Well, at some point, somebody is going to ignore the threats and just go ahead and ask the question, why do we have all these biolabs in Ukraine of all places? It's not like Ukraine is a hotbed of pharmaceutical research. What is that? We don't know, but at some point, people are going to find out. 

Now, the Intercept spoke to a virologist called Vincent Racaniello, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia. ""There is no question,"" he said, ""from the weight loss of the mice in the study, it’s gain-of-function. Tony Fauci is wrong saying it's not."" 

And of course, Fauci would have known that he was ""wrong,"" that was he was lying when he said it wasn't gain-of-function. It was. This is all becoming much clearer. The Intercept, in case you haven't heard of it, is not a right-wing publication. It's a left-wing publication. So, at some point, all of this is going to become public and it seems to be accelerating. No wonder Fauci's leaving. Then late last year, NIH just admitted it. In a letter to the House Oversight Committee, an NIH official called Lawrence Tabak wrote that a ""limited experiment"" had been conducted in Wuhan in order to test if ""spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China, were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model."" Frankenstein stuff.  

Why the hell were they doing this? Oh, and they destroyed the United States in the process. No one's apologized. No one's been charged. No one's ever really admitted it, but we know that Tony Fauci knew perfectly well this was going on because he's the one who authorized the grants and as the pandemic spread around the world. Virologists frantically told Tony Fauci in real time that gain-of-function research, funded in part by the U.S. government, was probably involved.  

In early 2020, Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California, wrote this to Fauci, ""Some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" 

David Baltimore, meanwhile, announced he had found the ""smoking gun for the origin of the virus"" what he called a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2. 

Tony actually saw that assessment also, right the very beginning. So, in response, Fauci called an urgent meeting and told his deputies to read up on gain-of-function research, a paper authored by a scientist conducting bat experiments in Wuhan at the Chinese military lab there. 

So, he knew at the very beginning and a lot of people knew and they all lied to us and they're still lying to us and not one person has been held accountable. But in public, Fauci refused to talk about gain-of-function research. Instead, he called for the arrest of his most prominent critic because he's not a Stalinist midget or anything. Watch this.  

  

""Oh, I should be.... no a sitting U.S. senator should be prosecuted for asking questions I don't care to answer because they would reveal criminal behavior and by the way, January 6 because Ted Cruz was inside the Capitol setting things on fire."" Oh, no, he wasn't. So, that was one of many very obvious displays of hard-edged partisanship from a guy who's supposed to be a public health official, just flat-out partisan. When Tony Fauci is willing to attack his critics, his political opponents, like that and then lie about the origins of Corona, it raises a lot of questions and one of them is, what else is Tony Fauci lying about? We should know.  

You might remember that back in 2020, Tony Fauci declared that remdesivir, a drug made by the pharma giant Gilead, would be the solution to COVID. Do you remember this? He said, and we're quoting, ""this will be the standard of care."" Now, when Tony Fauci says that, the guy in charge of our COVID response, is not a small thing, but when Tony Fauci said that, he said that knowing that the Food and Drug Administration did not hold a single advisory meeting on that drug remdesivir, but for the low price of just $48,000 a dose, Fauci promised that Remdesivir could shorten your hospital stay if you were ever to get COVID like if your mask slipped for a second. 

So, after months, the truth became impossible to hide as it has with the vaccine. Remdesivir doesn't work as advertised. Even the W.H.O. is now recommending against it. ""There is a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir,"" says the World Health Organization, ""This means that there is not enough evidence to support its use."" Oh, really? But what happened in the meantime? Well, Tony Fauci's friends at Gilead, which have been a struggling company, according to some, made a ton of money. They all did, so did Tony Fauci's friends at Pfizer and Moderna, as Fauci made the rounds talking up the only solution to the crisis that he helped create, which was, of course, the vaccine, which isn't actually vaccine. Watch. 

  

. 

You know, it really is an indictment, not simply of Tony Fauci, who's obviously dishonest and implicated in what appear to be crimes, we're not law enforcement agency, they do appear to be crimes, but it's an indictment of our system and the rest of us, certainly us in the media, that a guy in charge of America's COVID response could say so many things serially back to back one after the other, week after week, month after month, year after year, that turned out to be false, and he still has the job. How does that happen?  

It's like the withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one responsible for that was ever punished. They were elevated. That's a dysfunctional system that needs to be fixed immediately. It's not a partisan point. It's an obvious point, but on the question of the so-called vaccine, which is not a vaccine, by the way, you got the smallpox vaccine, you got the polio vaccine, you got the mumps vaccine. Did you get those diseases? Do you have mumps today? Did you get smallpox last week? Do you have polio? No, because those are vaccines, but you probably got COVID after you got the shot. Tony Fauci did.  

So, he had to sort of change the line a little bit because he had COVID. He was like a pincushion, he had so many shots, but he got COVID. So, maybe the COVID vaccine doesn't actually prevent infections. Maybe Remdesivir, doesn't actually work. Ok, but Tony Fauci has been consistent on one point, one point really only, and that is you need to give more power to the Biden administration, his patrons. Here's Tony Fauci this July explaining that his one regret during the pandemic is not eliminating every single last civil liberty in the country on behalf of Joe Biden. Watch this, if you dare.  

Much more stringent restrictions. We're not Sigmund Freud, but if you don't know little sexual pleasure, as he said, stringent restrictions, you're blind to the obvious, but all of it is fake, totally fake. It's been studied. Researchers at Johns Hopkins admitting that lockdowns didn't actually work. They did ruin people's lives for no reason whatsoever. In late 2020, a group of epidemiologists tried to warn the public about this because they saw it coming and they wrote something called, ""The Great Barrington Declaration."" 

Here's how Tony Fauci's boss, the thoroughly discredited, in fact, repulsive Francis Collins, the guy who convinced evangelicals to all get the vaccine because it's God's will, that guy, here's how he responded. Collins wrote to Fauci in an email October 2020 ""See  This proposal...seems to be getting a lot of attention and even a co-signature from Nobel Prize winner Mike Leavitt at Stanford. There needs to be a quick and devastating published takedown of its premises."" 

Wait, why? Why not assess its premises? Scientists disagree with you. Shouldn't you figure out why they disagree? No, just gin up the lie machine, NBC News, CNN, New York Times and crash them, shut them down, throw them off social media, get the tech oligarchs to make sure no one can hear what they're saying. That's literally what they did. That's not how scientists act. That's how dictators act and in fact, Tony Fauci himself made the argument again today. Tony Fauci is science incarnate, said Tony Fauci, and he must never be challenged.  

.  

Ok, first of all, the only people who refer to themselves in public, not ironically in the third person, are Fidel Castro and mental patients. Ok? So, that should have been a tip off right there. ""I am science. I am the state. The state is me."" Whoa! Settle down, megalomania man. This is nuts and yet it's not Fauci who's been damaged by this kind of behavior serially over years. It's anyone who criticized him.  

The Biden administration arrested one of Tony Fauci's top critics, Peter Navarro. They called him out of Reagan Airport in leg irons. Merrick Garland also ruined the lives of several Trump associates for the alleged crime of lying to federal officials. Recently, Biden's DOJ has been busy raiding the home of the former president for retaining classified documents, including a letter from Barack Obama. Okay, so that's how they're treated, but at the same time, people like Tony Fauci, who apparently engineered the single most devastating event in modern American history and then lied about it, gets to retire as a hero.  

Again, just like the bureaucrats at the Pentagon who engineered our humiliating credibility-destroying withdrawal from Afghanistan that got American lives killed, no punishment. Tony Fauci gets to collect his enormous government retirement and he'll be lecturing you from the stage at CNN very, very soon. So, what exactly are Republicans going to do about this, when and if they take power in January? What else has  about?

Turns out the symptoms of societal decay are universal. They're not unique to a specific society. You recognize them in any country at any time, now or a thousand years ago, always the same. The men become weak. The leaders get decadent. Law enforcement gets politicized. The currency gets devalued and then things begin to come apart.  

Pretty soon, it doesn't take long, the society can no longer perform its most basic function. The reason we have societies in the first place, which is to protect the weak from the strong. That's where you have a society. Well, in places like this, it becomes, among many other things, very hard to travel anywhere. You just can't go where you want to go. With legitimate authority in retreat, roads are not controlled by the police. They're controlled by armed predators and the armed predators take exactly what they want from travelers because they can.  

This is an ancient problem. It used to be called highway robbery, and for most of history, it kept people very close to home. Turns out it still exists, but now it's called . Carjacking is the clearest possible sign that your civilization is falling apart and that's why you find it in places like Somalia and South Africa, places where force, violence and clan loyalty have replaced law and order, places where might makes right. In the city of Johannesburg, for example, a vehicle is hijacked on average once every hour of the day. Now, once that happens, there's really no coming back from it. Nobody's going to build anything in the city with endemic carjacking. 

In fact, most normal people will leave as fast as they can, as they have in Johannesburg, as they are starting to do, we are sad to tell you, in the city of New Orleans, where carjacking is now a permanent feature of life. Last summer, a law student called Madison Bergeron pulled into the driveway of her home in New Orleans. As she gathered belongings in the car, a young man appeared out of nowhere, stuck a gun in her face, and demanded that she hand over everything she had, including the car. He screamed at her. Terrified, she complied, and that's what carjacking is always like. It is an act of violence. 

People don't want to give up their cars. They have to be terrified into doing so. That's why the majority of victims are women, old women, young women, and that's why the people who do it will do anything. If you will carjack, if you will steal someone's car at gunpoint, you will also rape. You will also murder. You have no limits. You are willing to violate on the most basic level, the civil rights of another person and in this case, that was certainly true because that same perpetrator went on, after terrifying Madison Bergeron and stealing her car, to do the same to other women in the city, a lot of them.  

""There was a car blocking me in,"" one victim recalled. ""And next thing I turn around, there's yelling and there's a gun barrel in my face. The kid is yelling to get the F out of the car, get the F out of the car,’ or else he will shoot me."" In all, the  would terrorize five women and steal five cars in just two days before New Orleans police finally arrested him and it's amazing that they did because there are virtually no police left in New Orleans.  

In a city that probably needs about 2,000 cops, they're under 500 active-duty policemen left in New Orleans. In New Orleans, they have definitely defunded the police. But in this case, the carjacker, a young teenager was ultimately caught, tried, convicted and sentenced for his crimes. Now, these crimes got a lot of attention in New Orleans. 

So, the mayor of the city, Latoya Cantrell, showed up to the sentencing, but here's the twist in the story. Mayor Cantrell didn't show up to support the victims, the women who'd been terrorized by this predator. No, the mayor showed up to support the carjacker and to let the entire city know that she was doing it, to let everyone know whose side she was on. Watch.  

It felt like she was supporting the crime, said the victim. Well, yes, it did, because that's exactly what the mayor was doing. Cantrell was taking the side of the carjacker over the traumatized, law-abiding woman. Now in New Orleans, Cantrell is known by her nickname Teedy, but many people call her exactly what she is: ""Latoya the destroya."" She is, in fact, a destroyer. The mayor is incompetent. Mayor is an open race hater. 

The mayor is an encourager of violence and she is destroying an already wounded city. We reached out to Mayor Cantrell's office to ask why she is doing all of this. Why did she pressure a judge to release a convicted armed carjacker with no prison time? But of course, she didn't reply to us. It turns out the mayor of New Orleans had a connection to this carjacker. Cantrell had enrolled this person in one of her administration's welfare programs called ""Pathways Youth Internship Program."" Using taxpayer money, the program says it provides young people who commit crimes with a reward, paid internships and a stipend.  

We contacted the Pathways program this morning. We want to know how many people enrolled in that program go on to commit violent crime within five years. We also asked how much taxpayer money they spent, but of course they didn't answer. But we don't need an answer. We know exactly what this is. Pathways, like most social justice scams, is not, in fact, designed to reduce crime. It's about siding with the criminal, giving the criminals as much support as they need, even a courtroom visit from the mayor, if necessary, so they can go out and commit more crimes as soon as possible. So, why would you do something like this if you were the mayor of a city of New Orleans? Why would you force people to leave your city, the people who pay all the taxes of all colors, by the way? Why would you do that?  

Well, possibly because the people who are left tend to be the ones who vote for you. So, it is a kind of electoral strategy. It's not just happening in New Orleans. It's happening in a lot of places. The downside is it leads to carnage. There have already been 191 carjackings in the city of New Orleans this year alone. To all of last year, they were a total of 177. Now, most of these carjackings and this is true in a lot of other places, Washington, D.C., we think, most of these are committed by people under the age of 18.  

Why? Because they know they'll get off. There's no cost. The local station, WWL-TV found that in 2021, juvenile carjacking suspects outnumbered adults by more than 2 to 1. Now, that doesn't mean that these are Nerf versions of carjackings. They're very violent. In fact, they're always violent and sometimes they're fatal. In March, several juveniles age 15 to 17, mutilated the body of a grandmother, an elderly woman, as they carjacked her in Mid-City New Orleans. They dragged her body down the street. Here's Fox 8 New Orleans reporting on it.  

So again, society exists not to protect 17-year-olds with guns. On the most basic level, those are the strongest people in society, people willing to use force to get what they want. No, society exists to protect people who need the protection, the helpless, the weak, grandmothers who might be dragged and have their arms ripped off without police protection and of course, in the absence of police protection, in the absence of leadership that cares about the weak, those are exactly the people who are murdered and it's not just happening in New Orleans.  

What's interesting, if you pull back a little bit and we have because we think that carjacking is a really clear indication of things unraveling, you find that cities with Soros-backed DAs and well-funded diversion programs for at-risk youth are seeing surges in carjackings. Could there be a connection? Philadelphia, for example, consider that city. This is reporting from a local station there, Fox 29.  

So, why is this happening? Well, it's happening for very deep reasons. Any 15 or 17-year-old who sticks a gun in the face of strangers, threatens their lives or kills them in order to steal a car, is the product of something that is very hard to fix, disintegrating families, that's the real reason, but society, the authorities still have an obligation to try and stop it for the sake of the rest of us. So, what are these cities doing to stop it? 

Well, Philadelphia, like New Orleans, sends so-called at-risk youth to violin lessons through something called the Philadelphia Arts and Education Partnership. So, the idea is, after a month of violin lessons, these young criminals, people who've been busted committing crimes, get the records expunged. That was the plan that Philadelphia's D.A. put into place last year.  

Has it worked? Well, sad to tell you that despite the violin lessons, crime has gone up among young people, carjackings in particular. As Philadelphia's police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, put it, ""I don't want to say it's surprising, but it's definitely concerning."" Really? Well, it's not surprising to us, but it is for sure an understatement. From 2020 to 2021, there's been a 108% increase in carjackings in Philadelphia.  

Chicago, too, putting up similar numbers. Chicago has had more than a  this year alone. What does that do to a city? A thousand carjackings? For every carjacking, there is a much larger group of people now afraid to drive. Hmm. Now, Chicago is the place where Soros-backed D.A. Kim Foxx recently implemented something called the Juvenile Intervention and Support Center. Right. 

For this initiative, Fox partnered with, and we are quoting ""Black-owned, Black run businesses"" called ""CHI by Design,"" which pledges to ""be bold in our collaborative approach to create anti-racist outcomes."" 

Really? So, it's been completely politicized. The point of law enforcement traditionally has been to enforce the law, laws that are passed by legislatures. That's a product of the democratic process in order to protect everybody else. Now, the point of law enforcement is to effect anti-racist outcomes, in other words, political outcomes. How's that working in Chicago? Well, here's Fox 32 Chicago to tell you. 

  

  

  

11-years-old. One of that carjacker's victims said that, ""He actually skipped like a child all the way up"" to the car he stole. We can't tell you his name because he's an at-risk youth. Apparently, he needs more violin lessons and he will soon be a productive member of society. This is a joke. The people administering the program know it's a joke. 

It doesn't achieve the main overriding goal, which is to protect people who just want to go to the grocery store, to protect grandmothers who want to go to church, protect everybody else who wants to go to work in the morning, who wants to live in a city where you can travel on the roads without being killed? Chicago's leaders don't care. The same is true, by the way, of the unnamed 16-year-old girl who hijacked a man's Audi while his child was in the car. That's an atrocity. Here's Fox's 32 in Chicago.  

  

So, as you so often see in these cases, the person who commits the crime has committed a ton of other crime because it turns out most crimes are committed by a very small number of people and in this case, the girl stole that car, stole several other cars that month, which makes you wonder, maybe violin lessons and visits in the courtroom from the mayor don't really work. Maybe these people need a father at home. The nuclear family. Right. Those things are not, in fact, racist. 

They are essential to any functioning civilization and in lieu of them, it is clear that things fall apart and the only thing you can do is to put people out of the public sphere away so that other people aren't hurt by them. That's the best we can do and it's obligatory that we do it because people are being killed and if you don't do that, you wind up the society in which 11-year-olds treat carjacking like a sport because they know they can get out of jail very quickly. Here's Fox2 in Detroit.  

Detroit police arrested an 11, 12 and 14-year-old for stealing high-end hellcat cars off the Jefferson North lot. 

So if you look closely enough at this specific problem, carjacking, and it's one of the many problems in our society that seem to be getting worse, but just look at this one and you begin to realize, because everything is irony at this point, the youth violence prevention initiatives that are supposed to stop this, actually enable it, indeed appear to be encouraging it and yet they're still getting millions of dollars from the Biden administration. The youth diversion programs that make these kinds of crimes more common have a lot in common with the equity programs for unhoused people that seem to encourage homelessness. Those two have led to more carjackings. Here's a report from Fox 11 in L.A. 

Yeah. So, if they're happening in New Orleans and Los Angeles and Chicago, of course, this is happening in our biggest city, New York, which is also run by yet another Soros D.A., but as evidence of the collapse of social order is in Philadelphia, Detroit, L.A. and Las Vegas, nowhere in the country is experiencing a bigger increase in carjackings than the birthplace of our new civil rights movement, Minneapolis, where this all started. 

According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, Minneapolis saw the largest percent increase in carjackings in the country from 2019 to 2021, a 339% jump. What the hell is going on and why is no one saying anything about it and why are these cities doing nothing to stop it?

715	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-student-loan-handout-reward-political-donors	2022-08-24 22:13:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Biden student loan handout is a reward for political donors | Fox News	"Fox News host reveals the real motivation behind President Biden's student loan handout on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You're hearing a lot of posturing about student loan debt, but actually, some of it's true.  really has crushed a generation, maybe multiple generations of American young people. If you're wondering why your kids aren't married or even living on their own, student loan debt may be a big part of the reason. They can't afford to. They're ad hock to some well-manicured diploma mill whose degree turned out to be worth a lot less than advertised.  

A five-year communications major from Arizona State. Perfect. Step right this way. You're now a barista in a strip mall. The whole thing's a scam, obviously. Think timeshares in Cabo without the waterfront condos. We said all of this many times on the show. College debt is real. It's hurting young people and there's really no good reason for it. So, when Joe Biden announced today that he plans to cancel some of that debt, the obvious response would be to celebrate the announcement, but we didn't right away. Instead, we paused to learn the details about what he was proposing. That's a habit we've picked up from watching people like Joe Biden in action over the past several years. It's always worth reading the fine print.  

These are the very same people, after all, who decided it was a good idea somehow to defund the police. They're the ones who forced the entire American population to take an experimental COVID vaccine, even when it became obvious that it didn't work. These are the people who sent crack pipes to crack addicts, the ones who think 16-year-olds should vote in presidential elections, the ones who screamed at you about how Ukraine's borders are sacrosanct, but yours are racist, etc., etc., etc. 

These are people, in other words, with a long and public track record of very bad ideas, extraordinarily bad ideas, ideas so stupid you couldn't make them up. So, the question is, is this idea different? We want it to be, but unfortunately, it's not and here's how you know it's not. Colleges aren't refunding any of the loan money. You are. You are. ""But wait,"" you say, ""I didn't defraud anyone."" 

""I didn't claim that a degree in postcolonial liberation studies from Wesleyan would be worth anything. I didn't take 80 grand a year from middle class families order to turn their children into Xanax addicted robots with no job prospects."" Well, no, you didn't do any of that, but you're paying reparations anyway. Wesleyan is not. Wesleyan is off the hook. They all are. They'll pay nothing for the scam they perpetrated, though they're a lot richer than you will ever be. No, you're paying. It's on you.  

Does that seem fair? Well, no, it's not, but it's how Washington works. Politicians reward their donors first. They're first in line. Joe Biden knows this really may be demented, but he remembers that. Consider the 2005 bankruptcy law, which has gotten not enough attention. That's one of Joe Biden's few legislative achievements in his 36 years in the U.S. Senate. That law prevented borrowers from discharging, getting rid of, credit card debt and private student loans in bankruptcy.  

All other kinds of debt could be discharged, but not credit card debt. Weird. Who benefited from that? Well, credit card companies. Where were they based? Delaware and those companies also happened to be Joe Biden's biggest donors. So, they wanted his support on this bankruptcy bill, which would prevent people from getting out from under the debt they incurred at their exorbitant rates on their credit cards.  

So, to get a support, the bank, MBNA bought Joe Biden's home for several times its actual value. MBNA also hired Joe Biden's ne'er-do-well son, Hunter, speaking of crack addicts, and paid Hunter Biden more than 100 grand a year as a consultant from 2001 to 2005. How corrupt is that? Well, unimaginably corrupt, un-American, shocking, but that's what happened and of a lot of Americans suffered as a result. That legislation hurt people. 

In the subsequent decades, student loan debt tripled. Americans' average credit card debt went up by thousands of dollars, but Joe Biden didn't care because the point of the bill was not to help Americans. The point of the bill was to reward his biggest donors and it did. Is that what we're seeing here? Well, let's see, where is Joe Biden's core base of support as of August 2022? Well, no group in America supports Joe Biden more fervently still than college administrators, one of the fastest growing job categories in this country. How's that for depressing? There are hundreds of thousands of college administrators in the United States and most of them have master's degrees.  

As you can see from this chart, that group overwhelmingly donates to the Democratic Party. People employed in the education industry (And that's what it is. It's an industry) gave nearly $300 million to Democrats in 2020. They gave $30 million to Republicans. Talk about lopsided. So, these administrators are the very beneficiaries of the single greatest scam currently underway in the United States. We send tax dollars to colleges who don't need them in the form of government backed loans, but instead of lowering tuition for you, they hike tuition every year at a rate far faster than the rising inflation. Then they use those profits to hire more useless, unhappy anti-American administrators, all while failing to give your kids even a basic education in anything that's worth something and then, because all of that isn't insulting and destructive enough, the government rewards them and exempts these very places from paying taxes. 

In our tax code, universities are treated like charities, though they are very much not charities at all and if you pay the bill you know, but they don't pay taxes and that's why their endowments are bigger than the GDP of some countries. Harvard's endowment is over $41 billion. Yale's over 30. Stanford and Princeton over 25. The University of Texas, bigger than them all. So, it doesn't matter what they call themselves. These places are not colleges or universities. They are hedge funds with classrooms attached and if there's anyone in the United States who doesn't need more government money, it's the higher education lobby, but today, Joe Biden threw them more. He said, to give these colleges, these hedge funds, more of your money and you shouldn't be surprised because he just rewarded his private equity donors, and there are many of those, by preserving the carried interest loophole. That just happened earlier this month. 

Your taxes are going up. They're paying half the rate that you are. So today, Biden announced he's going to force taxpayers to cover $300 billion worth of student loans. Now, you may remember that the Inflation Reduction Act was supposed to reduce the deficit by 100 billion. Oops. Sorry, there goes that three x. Biden also announced that his voters don't have to repay their loans anytime soon. Certainly not before the midterms.  

  

You can kind of see the appeal of Joe Biden in this. So, you must remember Joe Biden. He's been around since the beginning of time, and he was this kind of cheerful working-class guy. ""Oh, I'm from Scranton"" Now he's just a husk. He has no idea what he's saying, but the image of Joe Biden still resonates in your head. He's for the middle class. Of course, it's the opposite of that. If you wanted to help the middle class, you would send $10,000 to every family with a head of household who lays concrete or every truck driver in the country, but that's not what he's doing. If he wanted to do that, he would force colleges with $30 billion endowments to cover this loan forgiveness. He would also talk about mortgage loans and credit card debt, which are much bigger problems for most people. Car debt.  

Instead, Joe Biden is talking about what his supporters, the NPR community cares about, and that's student debt, and he's making you pay for it. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than 70% of the loans that Joe Biden just canceled you're going to be now responsible for are held by borrowers in the top 60% of income distribution. Oh, and that makes sense because only about 38% of all Americans have a college degree. Maybe everyone in your neighborhood, but only 38% of the country and only 13% have graduate degrees.

And guess how much student loan debt is held by people with graduate degrees? Can you guess? About 56%. Oh, so it's nonprofit administrators who are benefiting from this. Certainly college administrators are benefiting. We just told you that, but there will be other beneficiaries, all of whom reliably support the Democratic Party. That would include Harvard law graduates and that's why professional buffoon and former Harvard law professor Larry Tribe is celebrating today's announcement.  

He wrote on Twitter his métier, ""Good news for thousands of my former students. I'm grateful on their behalf, Mr. President."" Oh, you slobbering suck up. Shut up, Larry Tribe, but imagine bragging that Harvard Law students are out from under the crushing debt. How out of it do you have to be to send something like that? So, it's a good day for Harvard Law grads. They're in trouble. They need your help. Thanks to Joe Biden, many of them now get to take at least ten grand off their outstanding  and you're paying the difference. 

What's weird, what's missing from Larry Tribe's analysis, is whether the president can actually do that legally. Like, who cares, I guess now, but if you're a law professor, you should probably care. It wasn't long ago that Nancy Pelosi, you have probably seen this clip, we've been running all day, but we're going to see it again. Nancy Pelosi pointed out that actually the president can't do this. Only Congress can do this. Here's Nancy Pelosi.  

It would have to be an act of Congress. Well, that was last year, but we've repainted the slogans on the side of the barn, and it turns out Joe Biden can do whatever the hell he wants because Susan Rice works for him. Get out of her way. Just as with the eviction moratorium, the Biden administration said we're just to ignore the law. Donors are too important. All of this is totally backward, legal or not. If you actually wanted to improve the United States of America, you would think deeply about how to help people who never went to college in the first place, and then, moving down the hierarchy, you would reward the people who worked hard to pay for college themselves. 

They deserve something. They followed the rules. You can ignore them and once you've made them whole, you would think about helping the millions of people who scrimped, sometimes with low paying jobs, to pay off their college loans. Again, who did it the right way. There's got to be a reward for them. What's the incentive to do the right thing if there isn't? Well, Biden was asked about that today. He ran away. Watch. 

  

Huh? We're trying hard. Maybe we're too literal here. What does that mean? We have no idea. He had no idea. So, they haven't answered the question. How does it make any sense to punish the people who did the right thing, who paid their loans off? And there are a lot of those because Americans are law abiding people. They want to do the right thing. It's the law. They don't need 87,000 new armed IRS agents to do the right thing. They're Americans. They want to do the right thing. That's the overwhelming majority of the country. So, what about them? What do they get in exchange for doing the right thing voluntarily? Well,  was actually asked this maybe two years ago. Here's her response. I don't care.  

I want to ask you one question. My daughter is getting out of school. I've saved all my money, she doesn't have any students loans, but am I going to get my money back?  

Of course not.  

So, you're going to pay for people who didn't save any money so that those of us who did the right thing get screwed.  

No, it's not that anybody got screwed. 

Of course, we did. My buddy had fun, bought a car, went on vacations. I saved my money. He made more than I did, but I worked a double shift, worked extra. My daughter worked since she was ten, so you're laughing at me. 

Oh, so there's one guy in America who still cares about fairness. Remember fairness. If you want a functioning society, things have to be fair. If people believe things are fair, they will voluntarily comply with the rules, but the second they realize things are stacked against them or inherently unfair, the people in charge don't care about fairness, they will do all they can to shirk their responsibilities and to ignore the rules. 

That's why no one in Greece pays taxes because they think the system is rigged. Presidents should not accelerate that degradation of public spirit. Again, if you wanted to improve the country by disbursing billions of tax dollars, you would help people like the guy you just saw who worked hard to pay his debts and then if you really wanted to go forward with debt forgiveness, then you could make an argument for that, who you award it to?  

Well, you would award to people who might conceivably improve the country you live in. Who would that be? Well, let's see. Dental and veterinary students, structural engineering majors, people who did something useful in college, but you would never in a million years even consider giving a tax subsidy to lawyers or gender studies majors or diversity administrators. Why? Because you don't want more of those people. We have way too many of them already. And then you would never send money to anyone who supported BLM riots or anyone who claimed on Twitter that America is a systemically racist country.  

Why would you send them money? Why would you send the fruits of America to people who hate America? What is that? It's suicidal. No sane person would do that. So, what you're watching, as always, is class warfare. They reward the top and the bottom, people who don't need it and people weren't trying, and then they crush the struggling middle, the law-abiding, the people who want to do the right thing, who have collective spirit. They hurt those people. 

Why would you forgive the college debt of someone who spent six years majoring in oppression studies at Long Beach State? You would only do that if you're engaging in the ugliest kind of partisan politics. Reward my voters. It's the question of paying people to watch Joy Reid. It's like subsidizing an NPR pledge drive. The message? They do not care about you at all, and they're no longer pretending.

Once you accused a man of racism, fascism, sexism, embezzlement, perjury, sex crimes, mental illness, treason (The last of which, by the way, is a death penalty offense, let us remind you) and then you impeach him twice on related grounds and after that, you send the FBI to his home to seize a handwritten welcome letter from Barack Obama, which turns out to be a state secret possession of which is a serious felony. 

After you do all of that and they have, you wouldn't think there'd be a lot left to accuse the guy of. You'd think they'd have run out of sins, but no, it turns out there's one left and it's the big one.  

The crime of all crimes, an offense so diabolical, so morally repugnant, so contrary to the laws of God and nature that once revealed to the public, Donald Trump is done forever. He will never again darken the door of American democracy. He will slink back in shame to his lair off the fifth tee to prepare for his well-deserved punishment. We won't see him again until sentencing. That's how bad this is. What, ladies and gentlemen, did Donald Trump do? We can now tell you. Donald Trump created the . He did that himself and on purpose, with malice aforethought.  

The vaccine is Donald Trump's doing. We learned that this week from Democrats in Congress. They announced that shocking news. An investigation by the Coronavirus Subcommittee found, as Politico put it, that the Trump administration pressured the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the first  on an accelerated timeline. Following this?  

An accelerated timeline. They didn't even fully test the stuff. That's not science. Donald Trump doesn't do science. So, they just handed this stuff out to people, citizens, recklessly. In the words of South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, Donald Trump ""assaulted"" our nation's public health institutions with this poison, the so-called vaccine, and in doing so ""undermined our nation's coronavirus response."" That's what Trump did and here's the worst part. No one knew Trump was doing it.  

They trusted Donald Trump. He was the president of the United States. People believed him when he said the vaccine worked, especially older people. They knew they were at risk and they wanted to believe that a shot would keep them safe. So, they took Donald Trump's word and then they took the vax, and then a lot of them got covered anyway. It's horrifying when you think about it. Here is one of Donald Trump's elderly victims. 

Look at that man. Donald Trump's vaccine did that to him. Four shots, a human pincushion, now a desiccated husk. Before he took Donald Trump's vaccine, that man was spry, filled with vigor, and then famous for his mental acuity. Look at him now and in case you think, ""Oh, maybe we're overstating the case. I mean, this is a bad video,"" we're going to take you now to a live shot of that same man to give you some sense of the long-term effects of Donald Trump's vaccine. Here he is speaking at this moment in the state of Maryland. Watch this.  

Marjorie Taylor Greene controls Social Security? It doesn't make sense. The compassionate person in you feels for that man because you know what happened to him. He took Donald Trump's vaccine, which Democrats alerted us this week, wasn't properly tested. Now, your first reaction would be, ""Wait a second, this seems like a revision of what I saw personally. Wasn't it Joe Biden who promoted the vaccine, who made it mandatory? Wasn't Joe Biden in charge when it became obvious the vaccine didn't work? And didn't Joe Biden's media tell us to get the shot months after Donald Trump left office?"" You may remember that possibly because you remember clips like this.This is from July of last year.  

Yeah, take the vax or you're fired. In retrospect, it's pretty obvious they were carrying water for Donald Trump in that video. Now, if you're still not convinced, you're probably a cynical person, probably have concluded the Democrats are panicked about being blamed for the single greatest public health disaster in history and they're trying to shift the blame to Donald Trump before the full truth about the vaccine comes out and it is coming out and the midterms are on the way. You may have concluded that, but we're not cynical on this show. In fact, we're relieved .  

Now that Donald Trump is responsible for the vaccine, we can finally talk about the vaccine. Until now, we haven't been able to. Until now, it's been like living in a John Cheever story where the entire country is an emotionally repressed wasp family. It's 1952 and Darien and Dad has just passed out drunk at the dinner table, but nobody's allowed to mention it. We all have to pretend it's not happening. ""Dad's fine. Be quiet."" Over time, that level of denial is very hard to sustain. It makes you crazy, but thank God it's over now. 

Now that we can blame Donald Trump for the vaccine, we can finally tell the truth about the vaccine without being fired or attacked or thrown off the Internet. We really should have thought of this earlier because it feels good, the freedom of this. So, let's take a moment to talk about Donald Trump's vaccine and why it seems to be, among other things, dramatically raising death rates among young people.  

According to data from New Zealand, the government there, for example, children who were vaccinated between the ages of 10 and 19, were more likely (not less likely) more likely to die within a month of vaccination than those who didn't take the vaccine in the same age group and it's not just the New Zealand government that has found this. This summer, a Dutch researcher called André Redert  published a paper entitled ""COVID-19 Vaccinations and all-cause mortality."" 

The research analyzed hundreds of cities and towns. What did it find? ""We could not observe a mortality reducing effect of vaccination in Dutch municipalities after vaccination booster campaigns. We did find a 4-sigma significant mortality enhancing effect during the two periods of high unexplained excess mortality."" 

Oh, so the data suggests, don't prove, but suggests the vaccine may be killing people. Unexplained mortality is also on the rise in many other countries—Australia, England, Wales. So why is Donald Trump's vaccine doing all of this in other countries? Well, we can't be sure, but as Alex Berenson reported on his Substack recently, the Canadian government is seeing a similar problem at huge scale. 

As of this summer, people who took Donald Trump's vaccine in the Canadian province of Manitoba are roughly 50% more likely than the unvaccinated to be hospitalized or die from COVID. Again, to pause, how bad is Donald Trump's vaccine? So bad that people who take it are more likely to die of COVID. Hmm. Now we have data from more Canadian provinces, but they seem to be hiding it now. On July 28, the province of British Columbia announced it would stop reporting the number of deaths that occurred in people who have taken the COVID booster. Wow. Why is that? Don't ask. You're not allowed to. Oh, we are now because it's a Trump crime.  

The charts are also missing somehow from the Internet archive, which is widely known, of course, as a front for Russian operatives working on behalf of who? Donald Trump, but we do have the most recent available data. What do those show? Well, they show that 70% of all deaths in that province occurred in people who are boosted, even though boosted individuals make up just half the province's population. Do the math on that for a minute. 

Well, your first reaction might be, ""Oh, well, vaccinated and boosted people tend to be older, so of course, they're dying at a greater rate. It has nothing to do with the shot,"" but then you look deeper. You read, for example, the Lancet article entitled ""Risk of Infection, Hospitalization and Death up to nine months after a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine"" and that piece shows that people over the age of 80 have worse outcomes and by worse, we mean more hospitalizations, more deaths when they're vaccinated than when they are unvaccinated.  

So, it turns out when Donald Trump told you, as he did hundreds of times, certainly you must remember this, that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it turned out to be exactly the opposite and we're seeing this in a lot of different places, in a lot of different data sets. In fact, as Kenji Yamamoto wrote in the Journal of Virology, ""The Lancet study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals."" 

That sounds like it's hurting people's immune system in a profound way. As the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology put it after an independent study, ""Vaccination introduces a profound impairment in type one interferon signaling which has diverse adverse consequences to human health."" That doesn't sound good. What consequences could they be talking about?  

Well, in July, the German government put out a Tweet stating that at least one out of every 5,000  causes ""serious side effects."" One in 5,000. Really? This is a shot that was taken by hundreds of millions of people, including in this country. What effects are they actually talking about? Well, those would include decreased sperm counts. The journal Andrology reported in June that there was a 22% average drop in total sperm count in samples taken 3 to 5 months after the second Pfizer dose of the vaccine, Donald Trump's vax. 

On top of that, there is heart inflammation, myocarditis, which is now suddenly famous in neighborhoods across the country because everyone seems to know someone else's son who has it. In December of last year, researchers at Oxford found that, ""myocarditis risk was increased during 1 to 28 days following a third dose of the vaccine. Associations were strongest in males younger than 40 years for all vaccine types,"" but you knew that because you're seeing it among people you know and no one's talking about it.  

We're not allowed to talk about it, but now we can because Trump did it. Researchers in Israel, meanwhile, found that vaccination increased the 42-day risk of myocarditis by a factor of three. It's a very serious heart condition, not a small finding. Now, you may have also noticed the rise in young athletes dying of heart attacks in recent months, something you're not allowed to notice, but you probably can't help yourself.  

For example, a 37-year-old cycling champion in Scotland called Rab Wardell just died of a heart attack two days after winning a national mountain biking championship. Can't say he was out of shape. Maybe it wasn't vax related. Have you seen that a lot before? Hmm and then there are those five doctors you may have read about in Toronto who died in the same month in July. Now, of that group of five dead physicians, there was a 27-year-old triathlete who died after a swimming competition and a 50-year-old Olympian who died after a run. So, these are not people who are sitting on the couch smoking weed and eating Doritos.  

Now, we can't know why all of this happened, but the point is we're allowed to notice now, and that's significant, especially since some places are still forcing children to take the vaccine and that would include most colleges in the United States. They just announced that . In the District of Columbia, which is falling apart, the mayor has decided, she declared this today, that unvaccinated students will not be allowed in school. 

They won't even get virtual learning unless they take a vaccine, Donald Trump's vaccine, that appears to be hurting a lot of people, but unless they take it, they will get no education whatsoever. Hmm. Who knew that Muriel Bowser, the resolutely partisan Democrat who runs Washington, D.C., was actually working for Donald Trump, but she appears to be. At least you know who to blame.

Every year since 1970s, the State Department has published a document called ""World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers."" You probably haven't read it, but it is interesting. It's a detailed accounting of global arms sales, what weapons were sold and where they wound up after they were. The U.S. government published this report in the interest of transparency and then continued to publish it through multiple politically charged scandals and conflicts that would include through Iran Contra, two separate wars in Iraq and all 20 years that we occupied Afghanistan. A report like this would be especially useful to have right now and would be critical to have as the Biden administration sends billions in high-tech military equipment every month to corrupt oligarchs in Eastern Europe. 

Where are all of those weapons systems going? We should know the answer to that, but we don't know because this year, for the very first time in half a century, the Biden administration has stopped releasing that information. They never explained why they stopped. They just stopped and no one pushed them. Now you'd think this would be a scandal. If there's one thing the news media exists to do, it's to fight for the release of relevant government records because in a democracy, you have a right to know what is being done in your name, but not anymore. That information is classified, Mr. Citizen, so you don't get to find out where those billions of dollars of weapons that you're paying for are going. Who's getting them? What are they doing with them? You don't get to know.  

You don't get to learn about anything about Ashley Biden showering with her father. You can get arrested for that. You don't get to know how many FBI assets were in the crowd on January 6 and what they were doing. As we just noted, you don't get to read the affidavit justifying the  on the home of Joe Biden's primary political opponent. In fact, you don't even get to know why you're not allowed to know because that information has been redacted too. What are you a Russian agent? Stop asking. Didn't used to be this way at all. It's unrecognizable. A lot has changed in a very short time.  

So. it turns out, looking back 18 months, the 2020 election was the most consequential election of our lifetimes. You assume Joe Biden was incapacitated and couldn't change much. Well, true, he is incapacitated, but the people behind him most definitely are not. They are more ideological and more aggressive than ever. Now it turns out among those people is our largest and most heavily armed federal law enforcement agency. That would be the FBI. The FBI is not allowed to insert itself into domestic politics. That would violate the U.S. Constitution. It is completely illegal, but for several years it has become increasingly clear that that is exactly what the FBI is doing, actively working on behalf of the Democratic Party, mocking the rule of law, subverting our democracy from within far more effectively than any foreign government ever could.  

If that sounds like an overheated claim, and it definitely does sound like an overheated claim, unfortunately, you should know it's entirely true. We know that for a fact. Here's how we know and we learned it yesterday. Weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI pressured social media companies to kill the story of Hunter Biden's laptop. Why? Because that was a story that might have prevented Joe Biden from becoming president. That happened and we know this not because The New York Times investigated it. They didn't bother. They didn't bring you a special report in yesterday's paper giving you the details. The New York Times would never do that, even if they knew it to be true and they may. No, we know this instead, because Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook blithely admitted it almost parenthetically during an interview with Joe Rogan. Watch this.  

Oh, so Zuckerberg, just to be clear, you just saw it, but let's just unwind what we saw. Zuckerberg was asked, ""Why did you censor the story about Hunter Biden's laptop?"" And he said ""some folks from the FBI came to us and indicated there was about to be a dump of Russian propaganda."" Now, there is still rewriting of history going on in which some are claiming, some on Facebook are claiming actually, that the visit from the FBI had nothing to do with the Hunter Biden laptop, but the answer you just saw was in response to a question about the laptop and the censorship of it and the answer was Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation.  

Neither of those terms has an agreed upon meaning. They don't actually mean anything. What's Russian propaganda? Is it true? That should be the only question that any news or information company, including Facebook, ever asked. Is it true? Truth is the defense. No. It's Russian propaganda. Again, a term without a meaning. So, we wanted to know more. We reached out to Mark Zuckerberg after that interview and he responded to us to his credit.  

Zuckerberg confirmed that the FBI didn't put any of these warnings about Russian disinformation propaganda in writing. Of course, they didn't. Nothing in writing and that makes sense. If you're the FBI, you wouldn't want to put that in writing because you were, of course, lying. At the moment, the  about a propaganda dump that obviously would include Hunter Biden's laptop, they had Hunter Biden's laptop in their possession. So, they knew perfectly well it was authentic because anyone who looks at it does. We have looked at it and it's instantly obvious this is real and of course, we now know conclusively it is real.  

So, that laptop was not censored because it was propaganda, whatever that means. By the way, the FBI should never be in the information control business anyway. It was censored because it might hurt Joe Biden and the FBI is the government agency that pushed for it to be censored. Has that ever happened in the United States, ever? That is the definition of police state behavior: a government agency independently decides it's going to determine the outcome of a supposedly democratic election. 

So, why is it nearly two years until we learn this? Well, it turns out Facebook is a very political place. The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, paid hundreds of millions of dollars to affect the outcome of the election. Famously, we've reported on that and then, of course, there were Democratic Party operatives working within Facebook. So, on October 14, the Facebook communications official and former Democratic Party operative called Andy Stone claimed that Facebook was censoring this story because of Facebook's ""standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation"" whatever that means, but that was their initial explanation.  

It wasn't until late October that Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of the company, publicly mentioned the FBI's involvement for the first time and here's what he said, ""We relied heavily on the FBI's intelligence and alerts, both through their public testimony and private briefings that they gave us."" He testified to that, but at the time, Mark Zuckerberg didn't mention anything but the FBI warning Facebook about, ""Russian propaganda specifically."" 

Why didn't he say anything? That's odd because in October 2020, right before the election, weeks before a presidential election, every media outlet in the country and then candidate Joe Biden himself were using the very same line, ""It's Russian misinformation, it's propaganda"" and not surprisingly or coincidentally, dozens of former intelligence officials were saying the same thing. We can't play this enough. Here it is.  

.  

So, those are the shills who will say whatever they're told to say. Of course, no sober person would take them seriously and we missed the bigger story, too. We will admit that. At the time we imagined that this lie, that the laptop was Russian misinformation, was being pushed almost exclusively by Democratic partisans, but that's not true. It was much worse and much more threatening to our democracy, in fact, utterly corrosive of our democracy than that. 

Again, our media attributed these claims to former Intel officials who wrote a letter about Russian disinformation, but no, it wasn't just former Intel officials spreading that lie. It was members of the U.S. government, federal bureaucrats, people who work for federal agencies, senior FBI leaders who are still at the FBI. They lied and they knew they were lying and they never took steps to validate this claim that it was Russian propaganda or Russian disinformation. On this show in October of 2020, we interviewed one of Hunter Biden's business partners, a man called Tony Bobulinski, and he verified the authenticity of that laptop.  

He had firsthand information. He had texts and emails that were on his phone and also on the laptop. So, we reached out to Tony Bobulinski last night and we asked him a very simple question. Did anyone from the FBI ever call you or your lawyer to find out since your name was all over the laptop, if those texts and emails were real? If they wanted to know if this was Russian disinformation, they would, of course, call you, but not one of them ever did. They knew it wasn't Russian disinformation. They knew it wasn't propaganda, and they knew it was completely real and they lied about it. Here's what Bobulinski told us in October of 2020. 

So, to note the obvious, that's not some cable news mouth breather who's giving you his stupid partisan opinion about Hunter Biden's laptop. That's Hunter Biden's former business partner, who can prove he was Hunter Biden's former business partner. No one disputes he was Hunter Biden's former business partner. His name, his emails or texts are all over the laptop and yet somehow the FBI, the agency that sent a dozen agents to investigate a rope in a NASCAR garage, the agency that used hundreds of agents to hunt down grandmothers from the election justice protest on January 6, that same agency couldn't spare a single agent to make a telephone call to Tony Bobulinski to ask questions about the laptop. You claim it's propaganda, it's misinformation. Why don't you call the guy who's on it and ask him? They didn't bother. This is what the FBI has become: an agency that seeks to exert control over the information that you read in the media. What is this? Well, it's terrifying and again, this isn't speculation.  

We just had it confirmed in public yesterday. These are people whose main goal is to ensure that they never lose power in Washington, interfering with our elections and not simply by hiding information, resorting to force because they know they can get away with it. Joe Biden's chief political opponent, right now—Biden says he's going to run again. Trump has indicated he's running—will be Donald Trump and so they're targeting them. Is anyone noticing this? John Paul Mac Isaac, the computer repair shop owner who first obtained the laptop, says an FBI agent threatened him so he wouldn't go public with the laptop. In case you've forgotten, watch.  

Yeah. So, in a free country, no one who obeys the law is afraid of law enforcement. That's true. No one should ever be afraid of the FBI except people who know full well they've committed federal crimes. Period, but in this country, let's be honest, everybody's afraid of the FBI because you know exactly what happens to you if you tweak the nose of the FBI or if you annoy Joe Biden. You get raided. You get hauled into the street in leg irons. 

You get banned on social media. As Jen Psaki said from the White House podium last year, ""We're flagging problematic posts for Facebook."" Oh so it's White House, same administration which oversees the FBI, telling social media companies who's allowed to speak? It happened to Alex Berenson. It happened to Donald Trump. Now we know what happened to The New York Post and the people running the , people who did that, are still there. This is a huge problem. This cannot be ignored any longer.

718	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-green-new-deal-means-poverty	2022-08-29 22:14:00	Tucker Carlson: The Green New Deal means poverty | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to Europe moving backward over energy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

As we've often noted on this show, because it's hard not to notice, we are living in one of those moments where so much is happening all at once and information about it all is so tightly controlled that huge history changing events can occur and in fact are occurring right now and nobody seems aware of them. It's pretty unsettling, actually. Here's one example. Europe is descending into poverty. Did you know that? Had someone told you that?  

So, the most advanced continent on the planet, the birthplace of Western civilization, our civilization, is getting much poorer very quickly. It's moving backward at high speed. Just a year ago, Europe was a modern place. For example, the overwhelming majority of Europeans heated their homes with natural gas, as modern people do.  

In Germany, the continent's richest country, only about 6% of households, most of them rural, heated with cordwood and you'd expect that, given that, again, Germany is a modern industrialized country with central heating and indoor plumbing and all the other trappings of a society that has moved beyond the medieval period. Last year, only about 6% of Germans used wood to heat their homes, but that has changed dramatically. Demand for firewood in Germany has risen so fast that there is none left to buy. You can't get it, so desperate Germans are now cutting their own wood, scouring the forests like their ancestors for sources of heat. Watch.  

   

So, they call it biomass, but it's wood. They're burning wood again, as they did during the feudal period. That's Germany. In Poland, families are standing in line for days to buy coal, not in 1910, right now, tonight, cars queued up outside coal mines hoping for fuel. ""This is beyond imagination,"" one 57-year-old Polish man told Reuters. ""People are sleeping in their cars. I remember the communist times, but it didn't cross my mind that we could return to something even worse."" 

Oh, but it's come. Something even worse has arrived. The French government has announced  this winter. Just the other day, France had so much energy that it exported it to other countries. It was a net exporter of energy. Now, there won't be enough heat in France for everyone in the country to stay warm. In the U.K., 70% of restaurants are preparing to close to go under. Why? Because when winter comes, they won't be able to afford to keep the heat and lights on, etc., etc. This is happening across Europe, in every country. 

So, the question is: why is it happening? And the answer is extremely simple. There is an  in Europe. Cheap energy is essential. It is the key to everything that a normal society strives for: prosperity, safety, a longer life expectancy for its citizens. Everything depends on cheap energy, but Europe no longer has it and as a result, things are falling apart very quickly.  

Energy costs in Europe are expected to increase by hundreds of percent in coming months. Germany's year ahead price of electricity, that's the benchmark for all of Europe, it's measured in euros per megawatt hour, that price just exceeded €1,000 for the first time in history. For perspective, just a week ago, last Monday, the cost was about €700 per megawatt hour and that was a record. In other words, the price rise is approaching 50% in a single week. In France, electricity went up 25% in one day. That was last Friday. Imagine that happening to you. Here's what Europe looks like tonight. 

.  

Seven times more expensive. So, it turns out if you don't have cheap natural gas, you can't run the continent. Now, if you've got a graduate degree and live in a city in the United States, you may be shocked to learn this, you may never have heard this before, you may have believed that fossil fuels were on their way out any day now. And you thought that because the Davos people and our own leaders assured us of that for decades. They told us that green energy was the future and the future is here. It's here. As recently as last month, the World Economic Forum claimed that Europe could save ""1 trillion in fossil fuel costs by switching to renewables."" But it turns out, and this may not shock you, they had no clue what they were talking about. They knew nothing about the subject, the subject they talked about endlessly.  

Green energy cannot replace fossil fuels. Not now, not anytime soon. Fossil fuels remain what they have always been: the key to civilization. That is true now. That has been true since Homo Erectus started the first cooking fire in a cave nearly a million years ago. So-called green energy is not close, is nowhere near replacing gas and oil and coal. It's measurable. We could have known this. Anyone with eighth-grade math skills could have figured out in about 10 minutes that we cannot replace fossil fuels with renewables or green energy and of course, they must have known that. When they told you otherwise, it was just posturing. It was childish and destructive fantasy talk that apparently fooled millions of their citizens and millions of hours.  

The Green New Deal means what it always meant. It means poverty and the people pushing the Green New Deal must have known that all along. They don't actually believe climate change is an imminent threat. If they actually believe climate change was an imminent threat, an existential emergency, the first thing they would have done, the very first would be to ban private jets. Oh, but no. To this day, Al Gore still flies on private jets. Barack Obama owns tens of millions of dollars of beachfront property. He knows the oceans aren't rising. Come on. So, they're all in on it. It's a scam, but they don't care because they know they personally will escape the consequences of their own policies.  

So, when the French president announces that his people are facing the end of abundance, he's not talking about himself. He's not facing the end of abundance. None of them are. Macron and all of them understand they will always be rich and always be protected. They know that for certain. 

What's changed, what's so very interesting, is that suddenly everyone else who's been paying attention can see that they were lying. They are frauds and the entire population of Europe now knows that. Donald Trump, to his credit, whatever you think of him, caught onto this early. Four years ago, Trump warned Europe about its energy future during a speech at the United Nations. The German delegation laughed at him. Remember this?  

  

Oh, they're laughing. We have green parties here in Europe. You have no idea what you're talking about, but they're not laughing anymore. The Europeans have discovered that the real threat to human civilization is not global warming. It never was global warming. The real threat to people is global cooling, otherwise known as winter. Far more people freeze to death every year than die of heat.  

In 2019, for example, four times as many people died of cold as of heat. That's according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. So, when temperatures in Europe begin to drop a few months from now, this is a huge problem and that will be obvious to everyone. It's not global warming, it's global cooling. That's what's going to kill your grandmother and when everyone understands that perfectly well, a lot of things are going to happen. The status quo will crumble. Factories will close. Unemployment will rise. Disposable income will disappear and you're seeing signs of that already. Personal savings rates are down dramatically.  

In this country, 60% of Americans can't cover an expected $400 expense, credit card debt increasing year over year by 13%. That's the biggest jump in 20 years. Total household debt set an all-time record of $15.8 trillion. That's in this country. It's also true similarly in Europe. So, how will spiraling energy costs affect all of this and what we the cascading effect? Well, when the cost of keeping your apartment warm jumps by hundreds of percent in a single year, you become a completely different person. You change your behavior radically. You're no longer tempted to buy a new $1,400 dollar iPhone or shop at Whole Foods or even pick up an extra cappuccino. The entire consumer economy grinds to a halt because there's no discretionary income. So, it is impossible to overstate the downstream effects on the world of an energy crisis. Everything changes.  

How are the central banks responding to this? Not well. They seem to be making things worse on purpose. Now, in the United States, we're told not to notice what the Fed does because the Fed is now diverse and therefore great. Amazing piece in the AP just the other day announcing that, ""leadership of the Federal Reserve has become its most diverse ever. There are more female black and gay officials contributing to the central bank's interest rate decisions than at any time in its 109 year history."" OK. In other words, ""Relax. We've got affirmative action. Everything's fine."" 

Great, but somehow it doesn't seem to be working. The same central banks that intentionally caused inflation—and they did—those same central banks are hiking rates to destroy demand. The problem is, this isn't a demand problem. This is a supply problem, and it stems primarily from the war in Ukraine. Because of that war, the West does not have enough energy to continue its economy or society. Europe responded to that war by imposing sanctions that they knew would inevitably cause energy shortages. They knew it when they did it. Here's the president of the European Commission back in May.  

Really? Are you going to be keeping your apartment at 49 degrees Fahrenheit? Will you be walking to work? No, of course not. You'll have whatever you want forever, but the rest of us, she informed us, ""simply have to do it,"" and it's not just energy that's being affected by these sanctions. In Brussels, Joe Biden warned that food shortages are inevitable. Remember this?  

Oh, we're all going have to buckle down for freedom. We have to shovel billions to Ukrainian oligarchs who clearly hate the United States because it's the right thing to do. We need to hurt Russia because it's our moral duty. So, did these sanctions actually hurt Russia? They caused food and energy shortages throughout the West. No, they didn't hurt Russia. Russia today has more than enough energy, more energy that it can use or sell. In fact, Russia has so much excess natural gas that it simply setting it on fire. That's right. Flaring it, as they say. A Russian plant near the border with Finland is burning $10 million worth of natural gas every day. It seems like a big story. So, how's the media covering this? Well, here's the BBC.  

""Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice."" Really, that's your concern? More global warming, when the immediate effect is to make it impossible for people in Europe to stay warm. You can reach a place in your society where the people in charge and their lapdogs in the media become so completely disconnected from the concerns of actual people, become so totally uninterested in the lives of citizens, the society becomes very volatile, and we are fast approaching that point.  

So, we could fix this problem. The solution to this catastrophe is very straightforward: End the war in Ukraine. Reestablish energy flows into Europe and save the global economy, including ours. Is Joe Biden doing that? And other reckless Western leaders like Boris Johnson doing that? No, they're doing the opposite. They're spending billions more from their dying economies to Ukrainian oligarchs and for no good reason. The UK just committed $2.8 billion to Ukraine in a country where 70% of pubs may close because they can't afford electricity. 

This is the governments preparing for power outages in the middle of winter, as the Guardian reported. ""Under the government's last reasonable, worst-case scenario, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power."" Well, of course, cold weather will combine with gas shortages because that's when people use gas, when the weather is cold. Wake up, geniuses. And it's not just happening in the UK. Again, it's happening everywhere. Spain has just approved more than €50 million for Ukraine and that's not including funding for military hardware.  

In other news, Spain's Congress just implemented temperature controls on commercial buildings. Air conditioning must be no cooler than 27 degrees Celsius. That's 80 Fahrenheit, by the way, in case you don't live there in August. After 10 p.m., shop windows in occupied public buildings won't be lit. How about Italy? Well, Italy has allocated more than €600 million for Ukrainian refugees and yet at the same time, air conditioning in Italian schools and public buildings has already been restricted in what the government labeled ""Operation Thermostat"" that began in May. 

Italy's Ukraine funding is a lot, but it's not quite as much as France. France has spent more than $2 billion in U.S. to Ukraine and at the same time France is fining shopkeepers for keeping their doors open and running their air conditioning so we can send more weapons to one of the most corrupt governments in the world. In France, illuminated signs are banned from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. 

   

For our part, the United States has sent more than $10 billion in military, that's 19 packages of weapons, to what Mitch McConnell tells us is the most important thing in the world. Congress has approved more than $30 billion in additional spending. So, how is all that spending working out? Are we winning the war in Ukraine? Have we bankrupted Vladimir Putin like Joe Biden claimed we would? 

The ruble just hit a seven-year high against the U.S. dollar in June. Take a look at this chart comparing the Russian ruble against the euro. Russia is doing well. Europe is not doing well at all. Now, Joe Biden is calling for an unconditional surrender from Vladimir Putin. Here's the weird thing. By any actual reality-based measure, Vladimir Putin is not losing the . He is winning the war in Ukraine and Joe Biden looks at that as we won't stop until you proffer an unconditional surrender.

This isn't bad policy. This is nuts. It makes no sense. In fact, it only makes sense if the goal is to completely destroy the West in order to make way for Chinese global dominance. What would be the other explanation for this behavior?

719	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-californias-leaders-know-nothing-energy	2022-08-30 22:18:00	TUCKER CARLSON: California's leaders know nothing about energy | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices his concerns over liberal environmental policies on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

On April 24 of last year, and you may have missed this, the state of California finally achieved what the Green Movement has dreamt about for decades. It happened. The State Energy Authority in California was able to generate 95% of its total power from entirely renewable sources. They said it couldn't be done. We said it couldn't be done, but just months into the Joe Biden administration, California did it. 

""It sends chills down my spine,"" announced Elliot Mainzer, who runs California's biggest power grid. ""It's amazing. We're making a real dent in the state's carbon emissions."" April 24th, 2021, ladies and gentlemen, remember that date. It's a moment that will live alongside Thomas Edison's invention of the incandescent light bulb, alongside Neil Armstrong's stroll on the surface of the moon. It is a day we saw a glimpse of humanity's future.  

That's what the news accounts told us, but actually, there were some caveats to this achievement. For starters, April is not the time to test the power grid. It's the most temperate months of the year when electricity use is at its lowest. Nor was the grid in question statewide. It didn't, for example, supply power to Los Angeles, which is by far the biggest city in California, and now that we're being honest, it wasn't entirely renewable. As the L.A. Times conceded in a far lower paragraph, despite its press release about renewables, the state of California was actually, ""also burning a bunch of natural gas.""  

Now, according to scientists, natural gas qualifies as a fossil fuel, and it's not technically renewable and then there was this amazing but thoroughly downplayed fact: the green energy miracle that sent chills down the spines of California power executives, the event they described as ""amazing"" lasted for a total of (can you guess?) 4 seconds. Not days or hours, seconds, 4 seconds. That's what California politicians were bragging about: 4 seconds of not actually renewable energy, but the celebration obscured an inconvenient fact.  

Just a few months earlier, in mid-August, California's green energy grid had collapsed completely. Half a million residents lost power in the middle of a heat wave. Grid operators warned it was about to get a lot worse. From late afternoon until evening, they predicted, at the times people returned to their homes and were hoping to use electricity, as some Americans do, the state would be short thousands of megawatts and that meant millions of Californians would be without any power whatsoever and that would be a catastrophe, an undeniable one. So, to fight it, the state implemented a strategy the developing world has come to know, well: rolling blackouts. 

""It's almost 3 p.m.,"" the mayor of Los Angeles tweeted on September 6, 2020. ""Time to turn off major appliances, set the thermostat to 78 degrees, or use a fan instead. Turn off excess lights and unplug any appliances you're not using. We need every Californian to help conserve energy,"" except, of course, for the mayor of Los Angeles who gets to be on Twitter whenever he wants, but really, the message was clear: We give up. We're no longer pretending to provide a first world standard of living to our citizens, the most heavily taxed in America. We are Tegucigalpa now. Please play along and for the most part, patient Californians did play along, but the problem did not improve. In fact, it got worse.  

The California Energy Commission has just issued a report predicting widespread power outages in the state of California for the next five years at least and of course, September will always be the worst month. As the vice chair of the commission put it, ""Securing energy reliability is a tremendous responsibility. The responsibility is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill with the tools we have in hand."" 

Oh, stop whining. Keep the power on, but no, we don't have enough tools. What happened to all the tools? Well, those tools would include the famous nuclear plant at San Onofre, but that plant was shuttered a decade ago after 40 years of protests by green activists, supposedly on behalf of something called the environment, something with which they are personally unfamiliar, but it didn't matter. The state shut it down. What happened next? What was the effect of shutting down San Onofre? 

Well, scientists estimate that closing San Onofre led to the release of 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Now, if you believe that carbon dioxide is a pollutant and they all do, that would qualify as a very bad thing. But it didn't stop California from plowing forward anyway and doing more of the same: polluting in the name of . Now the state has announced a plan to close the San Luis Obispo Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. That plant supplies energy to millions of other Californians. So as a result of these and many other closures of actual power plants, the state of California now imports a third of its energy from elsewhere and that would seem to be an embarrassing display from what is supposedly our richest state.  

So, say what you will about California politicians, like them or not, it's indisputable that on the question of energy, they have no idea what they're doing and we know this because their track record of incompetence is lengthy and unbroken. They are majestic in their ineptitude. So naturally, they want more power over power. There's just so much more to destroy. This week, the state's surgically enhanced governor, Gavin Newsom, announced a new way to overburden California's already collapsing energy grid. He's got an idea. He wants to ban gasoline-powered engines and force everyone to drive an electric vehicle, a vehicle that has to be plugged into outlets that in the state of California no longer work. We're not kidding, by the way. Watch this.  

  

So, here's a guy who's never had a job, who couldn't fix a broken lawnmower lecturing, you about energy and architecture and transformation. The same guy who's presided over a state that can no longer power your washing machine is telling you he's going to control what kind of car you drive. Now, just think broad for 1 second. If that guy can tell you what kind of car you're allowed to drive, what can't he tell you? Why can't he tell you what kind of job you can have, what kind of food you can eat, who you can sleep with? So, of course, the instinct behind all of this is totalitarian, which is to say total control over you and banning the gas engine is, among many other things, an attack on your autonomy.  

 can be, above all, controlled by the people who control the grid and that means the next time that California's energy regulator decides to shut off the power, you can't go anywhere. You can't leave California. Now, a few things you might notice about this. First, they're doing this because they're so concerned about carbon emissions and burning fossil fuels adds to carbon emissions and is destroying the planet. If you actually were worried about that, what's the first thing that you would ban? Well, private jet travel obviously, private jet travel emits a lot of carbon. In just 60 minutes, a , in fact, than the average American household emits in three months in one flight.  

So, private jet travel is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the nation of Denmark. (They) pollute at a rate about 15 times higher than commercial planes. So, you would think since most people who fly private are affluent by definition, and the global warming cult is the most popular with the affluent, that these same people would have given up private jet travel because it's just such an obvious offense against the climate, but no, just the opposite. Private jet travel has become more popular since the pandemic. Business jet travel is up more than 22% since 2019. More than 70% of all private jet flights take place in the United States. What are they doing? Well, they're faring politicians like Gavin Newsom, who does not fly commercial, and of course, celebrities like Taylor Swift, famously. Her jet emitted 8,300 tons of carbon this year so far. Oh, interesting.  

So if you're looking to reduce carbon emissions, you would think they'd worry a little less about your minivan and a little more about their G4. Oh, but they're not worried at all about their G4 and that's why Taylor Swift, Gavin Newsom and Nancy Pelosi and all the other people out there lecturing about climate will never give up their private planes because when you fly private, you're not only immune from COVID, like you don't have to wear a mask on a private plane. Are you kidding? You poor or something? Shut up, but you're also immune from the immutable laws of climate change.  

So, California has no interest in preventing people who are making the rules like Gavin Newsom, from traveling anywhere they want. They want to control the way that you travel. Now that's California. So, you are tempted to say, ""Well, okay, California's beautiful, but it's obviously run by lunatics who are turning it into a third-world country. So maybe this is just part of their slate of ideas to wreck the prettiest place on the planet,"" but no, it's not just California. It's not just happening there.  

It's also happening in more reasonable places like Virginia. Law in Virginia currently requires gasoline engines, gasoline cars, to be phased out by 2035, which is pretty soon. States of Massachusetts and Washington have similar laws. So does New York, so does Oregon. In all, 15 states have supported California's plan to force zero-emission vehicles, none of which are actually zero-emission, they're just electric and could therefore be controlled by the energy grid and the regulators who oversee it, and it's not just 15 states, it's the federal government. According to the Biden administration, everybody will be required to drive an electric car by 2035.  

Another cascade of unemployable morons, every one of whom has a long track record of failure. Not one of whom has ever done anything in the real world, all of whom giving you a moral lecture about how your car is destroying the planet when they're flying private. How long is the country going to put up with this? There's no reason to pay $4 or $5 for gas, even electric vehicles, says Ed Markey, who's lived at public expense his entire life and has no idea what anything costs. A typical electric vehicle costs more than 60 grand, but that's only part of the cost. Charging an electric vehicle in countries that have a lot of electric vehicles, a lot of them is now more expensive than filling your tank with gasoline.  

As Swedish journalist Peter Imanuelsen put it, ""Electricity prices in Norway are set to reach about $1 per kilowatt hour. At these prices, it would cost $100 to fully charge one Tesla."" And yet, all over the world, countries, politicians who may or may not have deals with the electric car companies are forcing people to buy products they don't want, and force is the word. This is not a transformation that is taking place voluntarily as it would in a democracy where people get to govern themselves and choose the way they live. No, this is being imposed by a small number of people on top again, the ever the revolution aimed downward as always.  

A bank in Australia has announced it will be ending loans for gas vehicles. You just can't buy one. You can't finance it. The EU Parliament has just voted to support a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars beginning in 2035 in all of Europe. Now Europe, as we told you last night, is a place where they're turning off traffic lights because they don't have enough energy to keep them on. So, how is this going to work? Well, the fact it's happening at all is amazing. Take three steps back. Banning gasoline engines, which we've had for more than 100 years, which have completely defined modern society and that if you're a normal person in this country and don't use the subway from the Upper West Side to Midtown every day, but actually drive like the overwhelming majority of Americans, this is the biggest change in your lifetime. Have you been consulted on it? Has there been a debate about it? No.  

All you hear is you must do this because it's good for the environment, but that's a lie. It's measurably a lie. Electric vehicles are terrible for the environment. Roger McGrath took the time to spell it out recently in Chronicles magazine. As he noted, supplying the materials necessary for the battery of an electric car alone, just the battery, requires, and we're quoting ""processing using fossil fuels, of course, of at least 50 tons of ores."" It takes a lot of energy to process ore. 

A single battery for an electric car needs at least, ""30 pounds of lithium, 60 pounds of cobalt, 130 pounds of nickel, 90 pounds of copper, 190 pounds of graphite and roughly 500 pounds of steel, aluminum, magnesium, plastic and other materials,"" all of which are derived from mining. Where's that mining going to take place? In thirdworld countries with no environmental regulations whatsoever. How is this good for the environment? Speak slowly so we can understand.

And yet, in California, under Gavin Newsom's new order, every vehicle would require those materials.  Here's the problem. We don't have that much lithium or cobalt in the United States. So, where are those elements going to come from, which are required for electric vehicles? Well, lithium mines in China. Did you know the answer to that already? Probably did and the Congo. Let's go exploit Africa so we can feel virtuous. As The New York Times reported last year and we're quoting, ""Production of raw materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel that are essential to (electronic vehicle) technologies are often ruinous to land, water, wildlife and people,"" and by the way, land, water, wildlife and people are exactly the four things that the environmental lobby has no interest at all in. They don't care about the land. They don't care about the water. They don't care about the wildlife and they don't care about the people. It's not about that at all. 

It's a religion. It's about making them feel like good people and increasing their control over you. Period. By the way, none of this even addresses the national security implications of this. Just as with solar panels and wind turbines, the materials required for electric vehicle batteries come from and you know the answer, China. China processes 40% of the world's raw lithium. China's market share for lithium ion batteries is about 80%. That's according to Bloomberg and even if we somehow avoid that problem by mining lithium volcanoes in, say, Nevada and polluting the environment there, then what? Well, then you have hundreds of millions of Americans dependent upon cars that the government can turn off in a second that are, by the way, running software that tracks your every movement. 

Now, in a high trust society where everyone thinks the government is on their side, a society that hasn't just hired 87,000 armed IRS agents to crush small business and anyone who's vote for them in a society like that, like maybe Sweden, 30 years ago, that would be totally fine because we trust that they're on our side, but in a country in which the president of the United States is giving a speech two days from now declaring half the population a criminal element, probably not a good idea to turn your vehicle over to those people. 

This is the vehicular equivalent of digital currency. Electronic vehicles are a disaster for the energy grid, a disaster for the environment and a disaster for your personal autonomy. If this happens, it will represent the single biggest change in the way you and your family live in generations and yet no one's even talking about it.

Imagine for a moment, something probably never done before, but imagine for just a second that you are . You have spent your entire life in politics. You've ascended to high office, but in fact, you have achieved very little. As political careers inevitably do, yours is ending in bitterness and failure. You sacrificed your entire life to personal ambition, but you have nothing to show for it. You have no close friends. Your family is in tatters.  

Of your two surviving children, one is a drug addict and the other, you're only living daughter, has been arrested repeatedly and has also wound up in rehab. She blames her sexual compulsions on the fact you took showers with her as a child. You've never been charged for doing that, but everyone around you knows that you did. At this point, your wife thinks so little of you that she demanded you keep working, despite the fact she knew perfectly well that you had dementia. In retrospect, your life has amounted to a very sad story and saddest of all, it's almost over. Weeks from now, you will turn 80. This is the point in the journey where a decent man turns inward. 

Old age is the pause that God gives us to reflect on what we've done and what we've left undone, and above all, to ponder where we might be going next. If you were Joe Biden, you would ponder that. How could you not? But Joe Biden is not doing that. In the final days of his 79th year, Joe Biden is not asking questions about the fate of his soul. He's making pronouncements about yours, the soul of the nation, as he puts it. That's the topic of his  tomorrow night. Don't expect to hear anything transcendent as he speaks. We haven't seen the transcript, but we can say with confidence that Biden will not say a word about the single greatest problem that our country faces, which is the utter lack of meaning in our national life.  

What exactly do we believe as Americans? What's the point of all of this? Fighting climate change? Yelling about diversity and equity and trans rights? It can't be the point. Those are fads. They're not ideals and if they're all we have, we're in trouble. There is a yawning void at the center of American identity. No wonder everybody's gone crazy, but don't expect Biden to address any of that tomorrow night. Biden is, above all, a partisan, a team player, right or wrong. So, naturally he will use this time to push for partisan advantage ahead of the coming midterm elections and that alone is not surprising.  

That's what most politicians would do, but Biden is different in this way. In his age, Biden has lost all sense of proportion and restraint. His fine motor skills are gone. He no longer persuades, he bludgeons. ""What we're seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of extreme MAGA philosophy,"" he announced in a speech last week. ""It's not just Trump, it's the entire philosophy. It's like semi-fascism,"" fascists. That's what the other side is, says Joe Biden, an American president comparing tens of millions of his own people to the moral monsters we shot and bombed and later hung from the gallows in World War II.  

The children and grandchildren of Americans who died fighting the Nazis are now themselves Nazis, says Joe Biden, because they vote Republican. It's hard to believe that any U.S. president would say something like that, even in private, but Joe Biden just did and then a few hours later at a high school gym, he said it again. 

And we're not going to let anyone or anything tear America apart. I'll close with this. We're at a serious moment in our nation's history. The MAGA Republicans don't just threaten our personal rights and economic security. They're a threat to our very democracy. We must be stronger, more determined and more committed to saving America than the MAGA Republicans are destroying America.  

They're destroying democracy, says the same politician who had the FBI raid the home of the man who is running against him in the next election. They're destroying democracy by voting for the wrong people. They're attempting self-government and that's an attack on democracy. It was all so crazy and over-the-top, so extreme that you couldn't believe the White House press office would even try to defend it, would have been better to announce that Biden must have had a stroke, apologize and then move on. Yet the White House seemed completely unashamed of what he said.  

Biden's history-making publicist, the single dumbest person ever to hold that job, explained that her boss had spoken intentionally and with precision. He ""called it what it is"" meaning Biden called Republicans what they are. They're Nazis, he said so, next question. Having established his political opponents are fascists, Biden said about describing what they do, but surely knew what they do. Nazis murder people. It's who they are. So, it shouldn't surprise you that on January 6, Republicans killed ""several police officers."" Biden said that yesterday. Watch this.  

Imagine, Joe, if you turn on the television in Washington, D.C., and saw a mob of a thousand people storming down the hallways of the parliament, breaking down the doors, trying to overturn an outcome of the election and killing several police officers in the meantime. 

Did you hear just that? On Insurrection Day last year, Donald Trump's Nazi QAnon Army, ""killed several police officers."" Really? We didn't know that. How many police officers were killed, Joe Biden? Can you be more specific? Can you tell us their names? You can't, of course, and he didn't because there aren't any. Not one. The only person we can say for sure who was killed on January 6 was an unarmed female Trump voter called Ashli Babbitt, who posed no physical threat to anyone. She was shot to death by a reckless police officer. That killing was never investigated because she was a Nazi and you don't need an excuse to kill Nazis. With Nazis, the season never closes. There's no bag limit. Shoot all you want. That's the message. When you're Nazi, there is no limit to what they can do to you and feel morally justified as they do.  

Now, there was a time not so long ago when Democratic leaders told us that beat cops were Nazis. Remember that? They were the Nazis. Joe Biden's own vice president raised bail money collected through something called the Minnesota Freedom Fund in order to free people accused of committing violence against the police. One of the so-called protesters that Kamala Harris helped spring from jail was a felon called Shawn Michael Tillman. He was out for three weeks before authorities say he shot a man to death at a train station. 

Now, shortly after Kamala Harris boosted the Minnesota Freedom Fund, Joe Biden rewarded her by choosing her as his vice-presidential running mate. So, at the time, Biden was much less concerned with violence against law enforcement. His party was encouraging it. Cops were getting ambushed all over the country. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2020, a man called Ronnie Kato threatened to execute police officers and then made good on his threat. He shot two cops. He killed one of them.  

In the Bronx that year, a man called Robert Williams approached two police officers in a marked police car. He pulled out a gun and for no stated reason opened fire. 12 hours later, Williams arrived at the 41st police precinct and started to shoot at more cops. He only stopped when he ran out of ammunition. This is a trend and it continues to this day.  

Ambush-style attacks on the police increased in 2021 and they're up again this year. In fact, they're up 50% so far in 2022. How has Joe Biden responded to all of this? Did he alert the Justice Department to shut it down? No, he did the opposite. He invited leaders of BLM to the White House. That would be the same BLM that just a few years earlier publicly called for the murder of police officers in Minnesota. 

Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon. 

""Pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon. Kill the police."" That was fine with Joe Biden. So, his position on cop killing, we can say with certainty, has changed in recent years, but then so have his views on a lot of things, including national unity. So, here's a video that we have saved for more than a year and a half. It was recorded just after the election justice protests of January 6. At the time, Biden said he wanted to bring the country together. Do you remember this? Here it is.  

Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting in our nation. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature and so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh.  

""Stop the shouting. Lower the temperature. Unite our nation."" That's exactly right. Whatever happened to that Joe Biden? We'd vote for that Joe Biden, probably. We'd certainly like him back, but we can't now. America has changed too much. Why? Because the Biden program didn't work. It turns out the country needed more than equity. We needed competence. We needed someone wise to run the Federal Reserve. We needed engineers who actually understand how energy grids work and don't just posture about them. We needed a Pentagon that could win wars and a State Department that at least occasionally considered the interests of the United States. We need federal law enforcement that cares above all about justice. We needed Intel agencies that spy on our enemies, not on our citizens, but unfortunately, we didn't get any of that.  

So, inevitably things started to fray. Not all of these trends are Joe Biden's fault. He had a lot of help, or decades, but a lot of this is Joe Biden's fault, and he can't admit it, just as he can't face the prospect of his own internal future as his 80th birthday approaches, so he externalizes it. He yells at you, not himself. You're the problem. You're the reason things are broken, your racism, your transphobia, your minivan. It's your fault. You stood in the way of progress. You are a Nazi. We hereby declare war on you.  

That's exactly what you're seeing. That's happening and you wonder as Joe Biden attempts this, if he can pull it off. Middle class America is the problem? That's not an easy case to make. There are too many facts in the way of it. For example, last Thursday, the same day that Joe Biden announced that Republicans were fascists, that same day was perhaps not by chance. The very same day that Joe Rogan aired his interview with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  

In that conversation, Zuckerberg admitted that he censored the views of Hunter Biden's laptop, any news of it whatsoever because the FBI told him to. The FBI told Zuckerberg this was Russian propaganda, even when they knew for a fact that it was not because they had the laptop. In other words, the FBI interfered with the presidential election. That seems like a big story. In fact, it seems like a turning point, but Joe Biden ignored it completely.  

In a speech that day, Biden lashed out at anyone who might dare complain about the FBI. ""It's sickening to see the new attacks on the FBI,"" he said, suggesting that what seemed like legitimate criticism was, in fact, a threat of violence. Speech is violence, but Biden was not alone in delivering that message.  

That very same day, the Justice Department's designated mouthpiece in NBC News, a man called Frank Figliuzzi, defended the FBI on social media to the same effect, and so did many others. So, if you step back, it started to look coordinated and you begin to wonder, could it be that Joe Biden is not simply a lone elderly Democratic politician? Could it be that Joe Biden is a mouthpiece for much larger forces?  

It's hard not to conclude that because no single American president could eliminate this many core civil liberties all by himself in a year and a half. All of a sudden, permanent Washington can raid the home of a former president.  

""He had nuclear secrets."" 

""No, he didn't.""  

""Whatever. Who cares? He's bad.""  

And then round up his personal attorneys and then steal their privileged communications. That's never been allowed. It is now. No single president did that. No single president could turn trespassing any public building into a felony and then arrest hundreds of people for it and send to solitary confinement in the DC jail. No single president could do that. No single president could redefine an entire opposition party as Nazis and then proceed as if that were perfectly normal. That couldn't happen. No president could do that. 

A president would need help to do that and Biden has had it. This didn't arrive out of the blue. We've been building toward this moment for a very long time. Last year, the Biden administration decided to have thousands of law-abiding Republicans fired from their jobs, their lives destroyed. How did they do that? Well, they mandated an experimental vaccine that didn't actually work, a drug the UK government now admits can be dangerous and shouldn't be used on women who are pregnant or breastfeeding that drug and then they watched who disobeyed their instructions. 

I'm announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week. We're going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers. We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin.  

Oh, so that was a fast way to find out who was disobedient, but just in case there was any question, at the very same time, Biden demanded that the entire American population wear paper masks on their faces not to protect them or to keep them healthy. That didn't work, but as a kind of uniform, the Democratic Party's equivalent of the Mao pin and anyone who didn't couldn't be trusted that look.  

I hope everybody's realized by now these masks make a difference and the last thing, the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything's fine. Take off your mask. Forget it. It still matters.  

The mask makes a difference. That was from March of last year, at which point we knew the mask did not, in fact, make a difference except to cut off oxygen to your brain, but the mask made quite a political difference. It separated the obedient from the disobedient immediately. 

You knew exactly whose team everyone was on by looking at their faces and that, of course, was the point and once we allowed that, the progression continued and it's been stark. Wear a mask or you're dangerous. Take the shot or you're a criminal and at this point, vote for  or you're a Nazi. That's where we are now. So, as Biden explained on Tuesday, this is a big change. Once you've been declared a Nazi, you don't have rights. You can't, for example, be trusted with firearms.  

But we're not stopping here. I'm determined to ban assault weapons in this country. Determined. I did it once before and I'll do it again.  

We could rebut that. Yeah, they did before. It didn't work. That's not the point. Look at the rage. Look at the rage. That was this week. Remember a year ago? ""Stop the shouting. Lower the temperature. Unite our nation."" That was last year. Not anymore, Nazis. They're taking off the velvet glove and we're about to feel the steel beneath it.

721	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-leaders-bidens-revolution	2022-09-01 22:46:00	Tucker Carlson: These are the leaders of Biden's revolution | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson said President Biden is targeting Republican voters instead of unifying the country as he promised on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you're watching this right now, you are missing a rare primetime . Biden doesn't give a lot of those for obvious reasons, but tonight's topic is worthy of the occasion. America, ladies and gentlemen, is under attack and not from our usual enemies. The threat we face tonight is existential, but it's not coming from barefoot religious extremists living in caves.  

It's not the Chinese government. It's not even Vladimir Putin himself, the most diabolically evil man in history. No, ladies and gentlemen, this threat is worse than all of that and it's homegrown. As they say in the horror movies, it's coming from inside the house. The single greatest threat to America today is Republican voters, all 75 million of them. They are Nazis and destroyers of democracy. They must be stopped. That is the message of Joe Biden's speech. Just moments ago, he referred to  who are apparently marshaling at Red Lobster near you, ready to take over this country. Now, to underscore how deeply Joe Biden means all of this, tonight's address in Philadelphia is not being categorized as a campaign event ahead of the midterm elections, which is what it looks like. No. Instead, this speech has the full sponsorship of the White House.  

In other words, what Joe Biden is saying right now is the official position of the entire executive branch of the U.S. government. That would include the Justice Department, the various Intel agencies and the world's most powerful standing military. Think about that. Does it make you nervous? You don't have to be a Trump voter to see a speech like this as a turning point in American history. For hundreds of years, the U.S. has had a political system comprised of two competing parties. If you were to declare one of those parties criminal and illegitimate, what would you be left with?  

Well, you will be left with a one-party state and that is what Joe Biden is calling for tonight, a one-party state. It's shocking. You may have trouble believing it's even happening and yet it is live on television right now, and yet and here's what we're here to tell you, believe it or not, there is an upside to this catastrophe. Even as you watch your beloved country take a turn you never imagined possible, there is reason for hope. American liberals may have obvious dictatorial ambitions. There's no question they do. Only would-be dictators fear free speech and an armed population. But just because liberals long for a one-party state doesn't mean they're going to get one. They won't. In the end, they don't have the skills to pull that off. Liberals are too incompetent to overthrow democracy, and that's obvious from history.  

Every successful authoritarian revolution has had two things in common: a coherent worldview and a competent military force. Lenin, for example, Lenin had the writings of Karl Marx to provide an ideological justification for his revolution and he had the military genius of Leon Trotsky to pull it off. Together, these two things were enough to topple the czar and take control of the world's biggest country. For all his power. Joe Biden does not have these two things: Marx and Trotsky.  

No, Joe Biden has Taylor Lorenz and Mark Milley. Lorenz is the ideological anchor of the Biden White House. She’s its muse, it's Che Guevara. They are inspired by her revolutionary fervor, but Taylor Lorenz does not write weighty books. Twitter is her canvas and having surveyed her oeuvre, we can tell you that Lorenz's main idea appears to be that anyone who doesn't wear an N95 mask in the shower is a racist. That's the sum total of her ideology. 

Now, there are probably several dozen people in Cambridge who agree with that, but it is hardly the basis of a popular movement. It's not Marxism, it's whining. So that's the problem for Biden. And then there's Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley is Joe Biden's Leon Trotsky, but without the brilliance or the cool mustache, Mark Milley is a buffoon. He couldn't even manage to successfully withdraw forces from a country that wanted them to leave. Mark Milley's only victories take place at lunch. Pizza is afraid of him. No one else is. So, these are the people who are trying to bring us a one-party state.  

For the next several minutes, we'd like to show you the face of Joe Biden's revolution. It is heartening. The next time you feel afraid for the future of this country, the next time you think these people actually want to hurt me because obviously they do, remember who we're talking about here and you'll feel better. We're going to start tonight with Joe Biden's minister of information, a person called Karine Jean-Pierre. Karine Jean-Pierre may be the most self-discrediting spokesman in the history of revolutionary politics. She makes Baghdad Bob from the Saddam years look dignified. She's literally beyond belief. Here she was on Monday. 

It's not like someone just walks over the border. Karine Jean-Pierre laughs at that idea and waves her hand. So, there are two options to explain what's going on here. Either: Karine Jean-Pierre doesn't have a television set and has no idea what's happening in America right now. That's entirely possible. Or we think this is more likely. She has seen the tape but just doesn't recognize what it is. She cannot discern people just walking over the border when she sees pictures of people just . That's possible. She is that stupid. Want another example? Well, here she is, apparently with total sincerity, assessing a recent speech by Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida.  

Whoa. She looks concerned and frankly, so are we. Whatever you think of Ron DeSantis, if he's calling for Dr. Fauci to be physically assaulted, that cannot stand. That is bad. That's violence, but of course, the question is and it's always the question with Karine Jean-Pierre is: did that actually happen? Thankfully, we have the tape. Here it is.  

There it is. ""Someone needs to grab that little elf and chuck him across the Potomac."" Karine Jean-Pierre was horrified by this. Elf chucking? That's not even legal. Not since the early days of the Howard Stern Show has this nation put up with elf chucking and by the way, who is Ron DeSantis that he can physically throw a federal employee all the way across the Potomac River, which is very wide in parts and Karine Jean-Pierre knows that because she lives there? What is he Hercules or something? This man is dangerous. Chucking an elf across the Potomac and not only that, DeSantis just outed Tony Fauci as an elf. Elf, that's the word he used, not an approved word. That's a threat to national security. It is indeed disinformation, probably Russian. Everyone knows that Tony Fauci is very tall, that's science. That, ladies and gentlemen, is Karine Jean-Pierre. 

So, of all the jobs you could hire Karine Jean-Pierre for, a professional hand waver would be probably the first. If you need someone to wave a hand to look confused, she's at the top of your list, but if you need someone who can speak English in a fluent way and communicate ideas at the rest of us are able to understand what might be at the very bottom of your list, but they hired her anyway and the result is amazing and as we said earlier, heartening. These are the leaders of the revolution. 

Today, for example, Karine Jean-Pierre defined the term extremist for us. You never hear that ever defined, but she defined it today from the podium. An extremist is anyone whose views differ from and we're quoting ""the majority of Americans."" So, if your views are different from the majority, you're an extremist. Here's the best part. Karine Jean-Pierre works for a guy who's got a 38% approval rating. So, the question before the class today: is 38% less or more than the majority? Math is not Karine Jean-Pierre's strong suit and of course, it's not her boss's strong suit either. Cognition is not his strong suit. This is the man who took orders from men in Easter Bunny costumes. This is the man who chose as his vice president, someone who feels need to say mankind and womankind as if they're completely separate categories. Watch this.  

OK, so not only is it going to benefit mankind, you got to include ladies here, womankind will benefit as well. Transkind? That goes without saying. Transkind always benefits when Joe Biden is president. So, you have to wonder how different things might look if they had people with an IQ of over, say, 85 in positions of authority in the Biden White House. That would be really, really scary, but they don't. They don't at all and if they had people serving them in the media who were smarter, they could probably get away with this kind of thing. They could convince people it's totally normal to use words like womankind. That would be terrifying if our media, if MSNBC were able to convince you that womankind was a thing, but thank heaven, the media, as annoying as they may be, lack self-awareness to the point that we don't have to worry at all and to prove it, we have a dispatch from one of Joe Biden's most fervent supporters, someone who will definitely have a position in the coming revolution and that would be Max Boot.  

Max Boot of the Washington Post, professional warmonger turned liberal, professional warmonger. He just wrote a piece about how the real America is actually the most liberal America. Just get a quote from the piece and let you assess and keep in mind, this is part of the Biden brain trust. We're quoting. ""I've been spending time in some of the most liberal enclaves in America. First Martha's Vineyard, where former President Barack Obama has a house."" (Bit of a bragger, Max Boot) and then going back to the quote: ""Provincetown, Mass, an LGBTQ mecca where pride flags are ubiquitous.""  

What did Max Boot do in Provincetown? We're not going to pry. We're merely quoting from the piece and here it is. ""I even took my stepkids to a drag show."" So, if there's one sentence that kind of sums up the NPR revolution we're living through and we're going to say it again, ""I took my stepkids to a drag show."" Unfortunately, the stepkids were not interviewed about their perceptions of the drag show, but I took my stepkids to a drag show has got to be the greatest boast of all time. Can you say that? Have you taken your stepkids to a drag show? Probably not, but you know what Max Boot discovered from taking his step kids to drag show? And we're quoting ""Provincetown is the real America, so is Martha's Vineyard."" In fact, he said, we're still growing because we can't stop ourselves and of course, he can't stop himself and we're quoting ""they might be more representative of 2020 to America than the Rust Belt diners where reporters love to take the pulse of Trumplandia."" 

They're not taking their step kids to drag shows at the Rust Belt diners, I'll tell you that, but they will when we're done with them. They're probably not going to get there. Max Boot is going to be too distracted. Well, there are drag shows every weekend. You can take your stepkids to drag shows all over the country. So, he's not going to have time to effect this revolution. It was pretty therapeutic reading all of this. All you have to do is pay close attention to them, listen to what they say, read what they write and a calm comes over you. They're so dumb, they probably can't hurt you. We can't stop ourselves. Here is another example.  

That's the brain trust, ladies and gentleman. Why only semi-fascist, why not full fascist? And what's the difference, Joe Scarborough? Talk to us more about criminal behavior. I find it really reassuring, but the point, of course, is that journalism is when you repeat what the people in power say verbatim, and then you congratulate them for their insight. 

So, how does the rest of the world see this? And we play these clips all the time and, you know, they're annoying, but if you were taking a cold, calculated look at the people in charge of the United States, if you were a foreign adversary and you're thinking, what are we up against? What do you make of this? Imagine being in the Taliban two years ago, you were a Taliban commander and you happened to flip on MSNBC and you think to yourself, ""This is America's news media, really? I mean, my native language is Urdu and even I can tell these people are freaking stupid, but their secretary of state must be impressive, right? Who is the secretary of state? Let's check on YouTube and here's what you find."" 

Imagine being the Taliban with their turbans and their A-k's and Tony Blinken wagging his finger at them. ""Oh, you must release the hostages or else."" Or else what, pal? Well, it turns out nothing. Taliban gets to keep our tanks and our helicopters, and Tony Blinken goes back to performing Hoochie Coochie Man. Did he take his stepkids to the drag show this weekend? Probably. They all did. We should tell you that all of these people on MSNBC and at the State Department officially are not work for Joe Biden. So, the dumbness may flow downhill like certain other fluid matters. 

Joe Biden doesn't even appear to realize that his military, his Pentagon, which he oversees, lost the withdrawal from Afghanistan. In fact, it was just this week the Joe Biden claim very loudly that Americans would need personal F-15s if they wanted to overpower the U.S. government. Oh, there's no way you can beat us. You're not sophisticated enough. You're not illiterate sandal wearing militia in the poorest country in the world. There's no way and he made that argument with such confidence you have to wonder if anyone told him what happened in Kabul, let's look back, oh last year. He also doesn't appear to realize that he's accusing unarmed January 6 protesters of nearly toppling American democracy for good. Really?  

If you're afraid of Ashli Babbitt, so afraid you have to shoot her in the neck and murder her, you probably don't feel very secure. So, these are not people who believe they're strong, is the truth and watching this, it's kind of fascinating, actually and on some level, it's reassuring because, again, they're weak and afraid. Our plus-sized defense secretary promises to crack down on Joe Biden's political opponents. Oh, extremism, White supremacy. Then he flies around the world in a space suit and then it gets COVID anyway. Now, to show you how strong he is and to strike terror in the hearts of our adversaries, he's issuing powerful new regulations requiring senior leaders of the military to stop using gendered pronouns. Well, that'll show them. We've got diversity. Back off. So, you can no longer use the terms he or she or male or female.  

According to the Washington Free Beacon, which got the military's order, the U.S. Pacific Air Force, responsible for containing China, believe that eliminating gender pronouns will improve the military's ""lethality."" Diversity is lethality. Now, of course, on one level, it's terrifying because, no, this is a sign of buffoonery and weakness in the rest of the world is laughing at us and making calculations accordingly, but probably good news for you as the subject of Joe Biden's coming crackdown, because when they come to arrest you for your thought crimes, they're going to have no idea what you look like. The warrant won't say. It'll identify you as ""they/them"" or maybe ""Xie"" and ""Xer.’ You can imagine the confusion at that point.  

It's easy to get out of it. You simply identify with a straight face as pansexual, two-spirit and indigenous, and at that point they will slink away in shame. You're safe. Diversity was your shield, but the best news of all, for all of us in this country, is that Lori Lightfoot inevitably will occupy some elevated position in Joe Biden's coming revolution. How do we know? Because she's the single worst mayor in the country. She's stupid, she's mean, she's openly racist. So, of course, she is due for a big promotion in the Biden regime. Now, you might remember that when the previous administration started enforcing federal immigration law, Lori Lightfoot cut off ICE's access to city databases. ""Chicago will always be a welcoming city and a champion for the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities."" Communities who didn't actually live here at the time. They live in other countries because they're foreign nationals. They're not Americans, but Lori Lightfoot took a position anyway and she took it in the most affirmative possible way.  

To behave differently, she insisted at the time, and we're quoting would be ""cruel"" and you know what the word is? You know it's coming, don't you? ""Racist."" Well, this week, the governor of Texas decided to test Lori Lightfoot's commitment to anti-racism. He began transporting illegal aliens from the border in Texas all the way to Chicago and why wouldn't you do that? Lori Lightfoot has said emphatically she wants them in her city. She's not a racist. You're the racist. So, these migrants showed up. How did Lori Lightfoot respond? Well, Lori Lightfoot's administration declared that this plan is. Do you know the answer? Can you guess? Pick up the pen. Write it down. No cheating. Racist.  

So, it's racist not to want illegal aliens in your city and its racist when people send them. So, take three steps back. What's happening here? This is really a recruitment experience. No one in the history of politics has created singlehandedly more right-wingers than Lori Lightfoot. 

Imagine her in your new position in the Biden administration screaming on NPR every morning, Biden’s state broadcaster, to tell you whether she's deciding whether you can use your electric car today or not. Can we drive our electric car today? I don't know. Let's tune in to Minister Lightfoot. She'll tell us. Everyone knows that's coming and if there's anything that will provoke a counter-revolution, it's that we're going to be fine. Lori Lightfoot may have genocidal impulses. She definitely does, but like the rest of our leaders, she is too stupid to pull them off.

722	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-republicans-focus-issues-matter-americans-win	2022-09-02 22:29:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Republicans must focus on issues that matter to Americans to win | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on GOP strategy in the upcoming midterm elections on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

So, everybody's focused on this fall's midterms for good reason, but maybe bigger elections have already happened, more meaningful . These were local races that you probably haven't heard about because nobody pays attention. Here's what they were. Last week, the Republican Party flipped five majority-left school districts in big counties in Florida. That would be Miami-Dade, Sarasota, Duval, Martin, Clay counties.  

Miami-Dade alone is one of the biggest school districts in the entire country. It's got more than 300,000 students in it. So, this change has major implications for the education and the future of millions of young people. It's not just happening in Florida. A Texas school board that flipped to the Republican Party earlier this year is already working to change things. They just voted to ban race hatred and gender cult ideology in schools. So, there may be a lesson here. Let's say you're a Republican running for Congress in November. You might be wondering, ""How did these Republicans win at the local level?"" 

It wasn't just because it's a red wave year, because actually it's not really a red wave year so far, despite what you may have heard. In other races so far, special elections,  have been underperforming, amazingly. For example, in a special election last week in New York's 19th Congressional District, Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro. Now in a red wave year, you would have thought the opposite would happen. This was a very tight district. This district went for Joe Biden by only a point and a half in the last election. That's not exactly a huge margin for the Democrats, but Democrats won anyway, despite the fact Joe Biden's approval numbers have dropped dramatically since then. And it's not just in that district. Democratic candidates across the country have been outperforming Joe Biden's 2020 numbers in at least three other House special elections, elections in Nebraska, Minnesota and in the 23rd District of New York. 

So, why is the question. How could this be happening? Well, the Democratic Party has a really simple explanation: abortion. Everything's about abortion. Democratic voters are really mad about Roe v. Wade being repealed and they're voting in bigger numbers, but there isn't actually any evidence at all to support that that's true. Instead, there is evidence that the Republican Party may be at fault by alienating its own voters and not getting them to the polls. 

Ryan Girdusky has done a lot of work on this. He runs the 1776 Project PAC. He supported those for the school board candidates one last week. Girdusky recently wrote on his sub stack that Republicans are underperforming this year because turnout in rural counties is only about 30%, 30% of what it was in 2018, the midterm that year.  

Cities and suburbs, meanwhile, which are Democratic strongholds, had double that level of turnout. So, why are Republicans winning in school board races in Florida, but losing in big races in rural areas that they should be winning? Well, the answer might lie with the candidates and what they're talking about in those districts. 

For example, in February, Marc Molinaro, the guy who just lost in the race he should have won in New York, told the county office building to illuminate the building in red and blue. Now, those are not the county colors. They're Ukraine's colors. Right, as if his voters care. That's the message that Molinaro, as executive director of Dutchess County, New York, sent to voters: Poughkeepsie stands with Ukraine. 

Right. Everyone is sympathetic to Ukraine, but is that really the main issue? No, it's a joke. The same candidate also sent fundraising emails to voters throughout upstate New York calling for more aggression against Russia. ""Biden is weak on Putin,"" Molinaro wrote. Right. So, does sounding like Lindsey Graham actually work? Our borders are racist, but Ukraine's borders are sacrosanct. It doesn't work. Here's what he said.  

Okay, so just to be clear to Republican candidates, that was Lindsey Graham. Your job is to make fun of Lindsey Graham and to disavow Lindsey Graham. Your job is not to emulate Lindsey Graham and steal his talking points and if you do emulate Lindsey Graham and steal those talking points, you will lose and the losing candidates did just that. So, compare what they were saying to what, for example, Joe Kent was saying in Washington state when he won his primary there as a challenger. Watch this. 

Well, exactly. It's nothing against the Ukrainians. Again, everyone feels sorry for the Ukrainians, but Americans have a right to feel sad about what's happening in their country and to expect their politicians to work on fixing it. So, if more Republicans in November say what you just heard Joe Kent say, they will win if they talk about the issues that people actually care about in this country, issues that are relevant to their lives, they will win. That's how they won those school board seats in Florida. They weren't talking about Ukraine. They were talking about the issues that matter to the voters in Florida: family safety, happiness, the right of parents to decide what their kids learn in school. That message wins. Obviously, that's why Glenn Youngkin became governor of Virginia. 

So, that was Glenn Youngkin's message. ""You're a parent. Schools exist for your children and they're your children. They don't belong to the teacher's union and we're going to listen to you."" Now, Terry McAuliffe was running against Glenn Youngkin. He had had the advantage of a lot of money. He'd been governor of the state before. Here was his message and we're quoting, ""I don't think parents should be telling schools what they can teach."" Oh, turns out most people disagree and he was destroyed. His political career hit the brick wall it had long deserved. 

So, it turns out the Republicans who focus on the things that matter, families protecting families, will win. Along with the 1776 project, Ron DeSantis was one of the biggest supporters of those school board candidates last week. This year, DeSantis signed a law banning teachers’ unions members from talking about sex with your kindergartners because it's creepy and should be illegal. DeSantis also fired a prosecutor who refused to enforce the law.  

So, enforce the law. That's a winning message, too. It's not just about one corrupt prosecutor in the state of Florida. It's about ending the lawlessness that makes it impossible for Americans to live in their own cities. Blake Masters caught on to that message. That's how he won his primary in Arizona.  

Well, that's not hard. What's the point of having a country if your own government ignores the laws that your representatives passed? How is that democracy? No, it's chaos and lawlessness and ultimately it's autocracy. So, national Republicans are not that dumb. They could have figured that out, but they're saying just the opposite. It's almost like they want to lose. They're calling for gun confiscation, gun confiscation, guns from law abiding citizens, which would make you as reliant as possible on police forces that are underfunded. How underfunded? Have you checked the response times in your city recently?  

In the city of New Orleans, according to researcher Jeff Asher, the police response time is now over 2 hours, long enough for you to get killed. The city is talking about canceling Mardi Gras because they have no cops. In Seattle, the city council just reported, ""average immediate response time is up in nearly every precinct when compared with the last four years of data."" Ok.

In Austin, Texas, the police chief recently admitted that response times to the city's most serious emergencies are ""dramatically slower."" 

So, that's a huge problem and it puts the onus of self-protection on the individual, on the family. You have to protect your own family. You don't have a choice at this point. It's always been your right. Now it's your obligation. Are Republicans recognizing this? Well, here's John Cornyn, who represents Texas calling for gun confiscation so that you can't protect yourself when the cops don't show up.  

It won't save a single child and he knows that. What it will do is take firearms away from the law-abiding while they remain in the hands of the law-breaking. It will make the country more dangerous. That's a Republican United States senator, an incumbent who unfortunately is not up for election this year, but God willing, will be punished for what he did, but the point is, the  in Washington seems to have missed all of this.  

Look at the elections taking place already this year, and that's the clearest possible sign to the people who run the Republican Party to stop talking about Ukraine, stop taking people's guns away. Start talking about things that they care about: the economy, education, family safety, justice, following the law, our border. Those are the things that matter, and if you don't acknowledge that, you're going to lose.

723	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-murder-eliza-fletcher-fall-memphis-law-order	2022-09-06 21:52:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The murder of Eliza Fletcher and the fall of Memphis, law and order | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to Eliza Fletcher's killing and what the fall of Memphis says about the nation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The most important thing to keep in mind in a period of intense change is that things are, in fact, changing. Things weren't always this way so memory, history, is your best defense against manipulation. When you remember the way things were, you can fight to preserve them.  

When you no longer remember what was always this way, then you're at their mercy. So, with that in mind, it's worth remembering that 100 years ago, Memphis was one of the richest, best organized cities in the country. It had a booming economy. It had beautiful municipal parks, a lot of them, more than 100. It had one of the most modern sanitation systems in the world, something we take for granted now. When yellow fever was real, no one took it for granted.  

Memphis was such a big deal that it in fact was the informal capital of an entire American region, the Mississippi Delta, but not anymore. In fact, by last year, if you went to Memphis, it was hard to believe that any of that had ever been true at any point, because by that point and now, Memphis had become a husk and a highly threatening one. 

In 2021, according to federal statistics, Memphis, Tennessee, was the most dangerous city in the United States. Last year, it recorded a total of 342 murders. Now, how many is that? Well, by comparison, San Antonio, Texas, which has more than twice the population, recorded fewer than half as many murders. So, by any measure at all, Memphis was absolutely falling apart, but  decided to make a life there anyway.  

After graduating from college, Fletcher moved back to Memphis. Both sides of the family had lived there for more than 100 years. She married a man she'd met in church. He grew up there too and they had two little boys. She began teaching pre-kindergarten at a local girls' school. Here's a video that she made for her students at the beginning of the COVID lockdowns. It's only 15 seconds long, but you can tell immediately what sort of person Eliza Fletcher was. 

""Hey, girls, it's Mrs. Fletcher. I miss you so much."" So, every year on their wedding anniversary, Eliza Fletcher's husband wrote her a love note on Instagram. Reading them now will make you cry, but you can see why he felt that way. Her warmth and her decency shine through. 

Meanwhile, in Memphis, seven miles across the city, lived a man called Cleotha Abston. Like Eliza Fletcher, Abston also grew up in the city of Memphis, but he could not have been a more different sort of person. Judging from his long public record, Cleotha Abston devoted his life to preying on people weaker than he was. 

Cleotha Abston was a predator. He was an evil man. At a young age, Abston was arrested for, among many, many other things, stealing, aggravated assault weapons charges, carjacking and rape. In 2000, he was convicted of kidnapping a local attorney at gunpoint downtown and forcing him into the trunk of his own car.  like that are now common in Memphis. Last year, the city reported more than 100 kidnappings, but like most lifelong criminals, Cleotha Abston was never fully punished for what he did. 

He was released years before the end of his prison sentence. Nor was he in any way sense reformed by his experience behind bars. Abston was well known in his apartment complex as of last week for his sexual aggression and his perversity. He terrified his neighbors, but no one from any part of the justice system seems to have intervened. 

Early last Friday morning, Eliza Fletcher and Cleotha Abston met for the first and last time.. As her husband and two young children slept at home, Eliza Fletcher went for an early morning run through her neighborhood. Cleotha Abston followed her, stalking her every move from a black SUV. According to the indictment, as Fletcher jogged by, Abston leapt out, beat her bloody, smashed her cell phone, then dragged her into his vehicle. Within an hour, . She'd been sexually assaulted and murdered. Police arrested Abston soon after based on surveillance video, but he refused to say what had happened to Eliza Fletcher, so her family waited in agony, but he didn't care. He never spoke.  

Yesterday, authorities finally . She'd been thrown like garbage behind an abandoned building in a key part of town. The whole story could not be more shocking or more horrible, but here's what may be the scariest part. Some people didn't seem particularly shocked or horrified by it. 

In the hours after Eliza Fletcher's disappearance, Biden voters on social media seemed to dismiss the crime on racial grounds. ""Why are we paying so much attention to the kidnapping of an attractive, privileged White woman? That's racist."" Others seem to blame Fletcher for the atrocity committed against her. ""Why was she jogging at that hour, anyway? In Memphis? Come on."" 

The point they're making was clear: ""Everyone knows the rules. Eliza Fletcher violated those rules. You can't go outside his certain hours in certain places in America, obviously, and if you do, if you violate the rules, you run the risk of being raped and murdered. That's how things work in this country. So, adapt. Accept it. Move on."".  

To some extent, if we are being honest, all of us feel that way. Whether we articulated it or not, we know what the rules are. We know what we can and cannot do in modern America. Nothing is ever spelled out. Nothing can be spelled out at risk of punishment, but everyone knows what the parameters are. Cities like Memphis or Baltimore or Detroit or Montgomery or Gary, Indiana or Wilmington, Delaware, or a dozen other formerly prosperous, orderly, little cities across the country were destroyed forever by the rioting that accompanied our last progressive social revolution more than 50 years ago.  

Politicized criminals started breaking things, torching buildings, stealing and immediately anyone with a decent job just left. They pulled their kids out of school, sold the house or not, didn't matter, and they split for somewhere else and mostly they have never come back. That is true not simply in Memphis, but in places all over the country.  

So, it seems a little weird to a lot of people when someone like Eliza Fletcher, someone who could live anywhere, voluntarily moves back to a place like Memphis, not to some suburb of Memphis, but to the city of Memphis. That seems weird to people. but it's not weird. It's not at all when you think about it. Eliza Fletcher was from Memphis. She grew up there, and she had a right to come back. This was her country, too, just as it's your country too.  

An American citizen should be able to live or walk anywhere in America without being raped or murdered for it, period. That is the baseline requirement for civilization. It's called order. But increasingly, that is not what we have. What we have is a country where you just can't go some places. You're not wanted there and it's too dangerous for you to go. Most people accept this by default, but we should never accept this under any circumstances. To accept something is to concede that it is more or less normal.  

Once we acknowledge something as normal, whether it's children being castrated in the name of trans rights or women being murdered by rapists who should have been in prison but weren't because equity, once we accept that as normal, we are stuck with it forever. It is the new status quo. It will never change except to get worse.  

The good people who lived in  a century ago would never believe what has happened to the city they built. They would weep if they saw it. That will be the experience of every American before long. Our entire country will be Memphis if we don't put a stop to this insanity right now with as much force as is required.

Queen Elizabeth II died today in Scotland, as you likely know, at the age of 96. She was the longest serving monarch in British history. She was born in one world and died in another. It's not easy to maintain your dignity while living in the public eye. Most of us could not pull it off for an afternoon. Queen Elizabeth did it for more than 70 years.  

""I want to ask you all,"" she wrote shortly before her coronation in 1953, ""whatever your religion may be, to pray for me on that day, to pray that God may give me wisdom and strength to carry out the solemn promises I shall be making and that I may faithfully serve Him and you all the days of my life."" 

For the most part, she did just that, and that was not a small achievement given the period she lived in. The week that Elizabeth was coronated, Edmund Hillary, a British subject from New Zealand, a beekeeper, became the first man in history to summit Mount Everest. The achievement seemed symbolic at the time – Britain on top of the world. But in fact, Britain was already over, whether the British knew it or not. To this day, Britain claims to have won both of the 20th century's world wars, but together, they destroyed that nation forever.  

After victory came humiliation. The empire evaporated, and along with it, Britain's self-confidence and ultimately its self-respect. It's hard to believe now, but Britain wasn't always a regional banking center/refugee camp. It was a real place with a history and a language and a culture and a genuinely remarkable people, a country in the North Atlantic, the size of Alabama, that somehow took over the world and ruled it with decency unmatched by any empire in human history.  

The British Empire was not perfect, but it was far more humane than any other ever. It's gone now, barely even remembered. Queen Elizabeth II was the last living link to a truly Great Britain. Today on social media, the usual ghouls celebrated her death. ""May her pain be excruciating,"" a Carnegie Mellon professor called Uju Anya wrote on Twitter of the queen. ""May she die in agony."" 

Various know-nothings in the media, including a columnist at The Atlantic and a couple of employees of NBC News, seconded that thought. ""The British Empire was evil,"" they wrote, apparently totally unaware of what came after it. And speaking of: what did come after the British Empire? How, for example, did Africa fare after the British left? Let's see. Uganda got Idi Amin, who was a cannibal. Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and then became the poorest country on the planet under the racist lunatic Robert Mugabe. As of tonight, South Africa is still being run into the ground by an incompetent kleptocratic called Cyril Ramaphosa. 

So, it's hard to see any of that as an improvement because it's not an improvement. Sorry, Atlantic Magazine. And now, of course, the entire continent of Africa has a new master: the Chinese government. China is the latest colonial power to dominate Africa. Its subjects will be pining for the British soon, assuming they are not already. In an ideal world, they would not be empires, no empires, only sovereign nations, but we don't have that world and we never have had that world going back to at least the Assyrians 1,400 years before Christ. In the real world, the one that we live in, strong countries dominate weak countries and that trend shows no sign of changing. The very least you can say about the English is that they took their colonial responsibilities seriously. They didn't just take things, they added. 

When the U.S. government withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years, we left behind airstrips, shipping containers and guns. When the British pulled out of India, they left behind an entire civilization, a language, a legal system, schools, churches and public buildings, all of which are still in use today. Here's the train station the English built in Bombay, for example. There's nothing like that in Washington, DC right now, much less in Kabul or Baghdad. Today, India is far more powerful than the UK, the nation that once ruled it and yet, after 75 years of independence, has that country produced a single building as beautiful as the Bombay train station that the British colonialists built? No, sadly, it has not. Not one.  

So, despite what they may be claiming on Twitter tonight, the British Empire was more than just genocide. In fact, the British did not commit genocide, except arguably against the Dutch during the Boer War. The British did give the world the Magna Carta and habeas corpus and free speech. They helped end the transatlantic slave trade, as well as the ritual murder of widows in India. The British Empire spread Protestant Christianity to the entire world. It published some of the greatest literature ever written and produced the finest manufactured goods ever made anywhere at any time, including now. 

It was an impressive place run by impressive people. We will see many empires going forward, but we will never see one so benign. That's true and because it's true, the people who would like to run the world in a far harsher way would like to make certain that you don't know it. And so they destroy the evidence, the evidence that ever existed. Here they are tearing down a statue of a British philanthropist in the UK two years ago.  

Destroy the statue, erase the memory. That's why they're doing it. Slander the ruler, discredit the entire period she lived in. And that's exactly why they're attacking Queen Elizabeth tonight—not because she was a bad person, she wasn't a bad person, but because she lived during a better time.

725	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-disinformation-latino-support-republicans	2022-09-09 22:13:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Behind the 'disinformation' about Latino support for Republicans | Fox News	"WARNING-Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson looks at Hispanic voters moving over to the Republican Party and rising violent crime on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Way back in the summer of 2016, a phenomenon appeared in several political polls that nobody in the American media could explain. Donald Trump seemed to be performing exceptionally well among in Florida. It was bizarre, so bizarre that everyone knew it could not be happening. It was scientifically impossible. If there's one thing that every reporter in America understood, it was that Donald Trump hated Hispanics like the devil hates holy water.  

Some believed Trump was planning a national ban on picante sauce. That's how deep and implacable his hatred was and yet, according to what journalists refer to as ""the data"", actual Hispanics seem to like Donald Trump. Cognitive dissonance is the term that describes what happened next. How could the numbers show something that couldn't be happening? So, the Miami Herald looked into it and their conclusion was fairly straightforward: Hispanic voters in Florida were mentally ill and also evil.  

As one Miami Herald columnist put it, ""Donald Trump's Cuban-American followers suffer from ""Cuban Supremacy Syndrome."" It's an old national ailment of the soul."" So, that was the diagnosis, something called Cuban Supremacy Syndrome, a serious but previously unknown medical condition like ADHD or long COVID. Someone better call a doctor. This could be fatall. But before the medical establishment could intervene to save Hispanic voters from themselves, this ailment spread like the virus it was, first from Florida, then to Texas and then across the country.  

By 2020, it was endemic. In the presidential election that year, Donald Trump, the guy who wanted to build a wall, became the first Republican in history to win Zapata County, Texas. Zapata County, Texas is approximately 94% Hispanic (94%) and he won. For the Democratic Party, this was an emergency made worse by the fact that there were no Cubans in Zapata County, Texas. It's pretty much all Mexican-American, so Cuban Supremacy Syndrome could not be the cause of it. And that's what a man called Eduardo Gamarra came to the rescue. 

Now, Gamarra is a blue-eyed college professor from Florida who has somehow convinced news organizations that he is the world's authority on what recently arrived poor people from Central America really think and he had a new diagnosis. Gamarra, NBC News reported, found a ""casual link between misinformation and disinformation and how Spanish speakers have voted in recent elections."" 

Of course, it was obvious Putin did it, just like Putin caused inflation and monkeypox and that war in Europe. According to Professor Gamarra, Hispanic voters were just too stupid to realize what was going on. They had no idea they were being fooled. They're just too dumb to Democrats. This explanation made perfect sense, of course, and they bought it. A survey last month from WPA intelligence found that more than half of CNN and MSNBC viewers now believe that ""disinformation is compelling Hispanic voters to vote Republican."" Here's NBC News. 

Did you hear that? Democratic strategists are sounding the alarm that Latinos spend so much time staring glassy-eyed at their phones that they now have questions about the fairness of the last election. How to fix this? Obviously, we're going to need a lot more censorship to keep this disinformation away from all those gullible Latinos. Someone get Mark Zuckerberg on the phone immediately. It's hilarious. 

The bad news about the Democratic Party, obviously, is that it has become authoritarian. The good news is it remains ridiculous. 

These are people who believe their own improbable propaganda. It sets up the real explanation. So, what is the answer? Why exactly are Hispanic voters moving to the right? They definitely are. The latest Fox News polling shows that 72% of Hispanic voters are not satisfied with the direction the Democrats are taking in the United States. Why? Why is that? What problem dohave with the Democratic Party? 

Well, the answer might be as obvious as it seems. They just don't like what we've got now. It is entirely possible that, like all normal people, Hispanic voters have come to despise the entitled urban liberals who run everything, and why wouldn't they despise them? Those people are absurd. Not a single word they utter is sincere ever and everything they touch turns to filth. We can give you countless examples of this, but we're going to pull one from today's news. 

Washington, D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau  has long promised to love and protect illegal aliens in Washington, D.C and thanks to her and many like her local government, the District of Columbia is now a ""sanctuary city."" That's how much they love illegal aliens, Brianne Nadeau  especially. She loves them and yet the moment actual illegal aliens showed up in Washington, D.C., sent by the governor of Texas, Brianne Nadeau became completely hysterical about it. Watch this. 

They've turned us into a border town. Really? Why is that bad? What's wrong with border towns? Weren't you just telling us, Brianne Nadeau, how great border towns are, so much diversity, so much strength.

But as it turns out, and this probably won't shock you, Brianne Nadeau didn't mean any of it. Brianne Nadeau doesn't want illegal aliens in her neighborhood any more than the overwhelmingly Hispanic voters of Zapata County, Texas, want them in theirs. So, what would that make Brianne Nadeau? Well, a disgusting little hypocrite. You knew that already. A lot of Hispanic voters are learning it now. So, there's that: the basic repulsiveness of Democratic Party leaders – by the way, nearly all of whom are openly hostile to the historic Christianity of Latin America that a lot of immigrants still believe in. But then there's also crime.  

 is the big one. It seems likely that more than any other issue, crime, the increase in crime in the United States, is moving Hispanic voters to the right. They see, as we all see, liberals aggressively encouraging crime. Crime destroys their neighborhoods. Crime destroys the lives of the weakest and these voters, like all voters watched Nancy Pelosi call MS-13 children of God at the same moment that MS-13 members were hacking Salvadoran immigrants to death with machetes. Remember when Pelosi said that? Here it is.  

So, they watch someone who clearly doesn't actually believe in God, invoke God repeatedly to defend something that's completely indefensible. Just a year before Pelosi's heartfelt tribute to MS-13 an MS-13 gang member stabbed a man outside Washington more than 100 times and then beheaded him and ripped out his heart. That was a child of God? No, Trump was right. That was an animal. Hispanic voters can see that. Most of them did not go to Yale Law School to their great credit.  

Just days ago, a man called Jose Solano  Landaeta beheaded a mother on the street in Silicon Valley. Her two young children watched as he murdered her and who was this man? We reached out to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office officials to learn more about him. We asked, was he here in the country illegally? And here's the response that we got. ""I'm sorry, I'm not able to share that information."" 

Why is that? Well, we can guess why, because, of course, there's a very high chance that this man was in the country illegally and not by accident. Democrats have suspended border enforcement to win the love of Hispanic voters. What they apparently did not realize because they're not super bright, is that Hispanic voters don't want violent lunatics in their neighborhoods either. They're not into beheading people. Who knew?

There's one other factor that may be moving this large and centrally important group of voters to the right. People whose families have immigrated from the third world may be more sensitive than most to the importance of the rule of law. The rule of law is the one thing that America has always had that the rest of world has not. That's why people come here and most immigrants consider it important still. Liberals do not consider it important. They're working to end it. Equal protection under the law is disappearing.  

At every level of American life, Liberals apply an obvious double standard and that double standard is based on race. That would be matters of education and employment, obviously, but also matters of law enforcement and criminal justice. Liberals put up with certain behavior from some people that they would never accept in other people. That is the definition of unfairness, but you see it every single day. Remember the arrest of that Dominican bodega owner in New York, the guy who was violently assaulted by a man whose girlfriend tried to rob the store? The bodega owner tried to defend himself, and he stabbed his attacker, as most people would.  

Authorities in New York charged that man with murder and sentenced to jail and everyone could tell this was a double standard. Would an elderly Black bodega owner had been arrested for stabbing a Dominican attacker? Obviously not. No one said it, but everyone saw it and everyone understood the unfairness of that, including Hispanic voters. Why would they like it? If they wanted to live in a deeply unfair society, they would have stayed in the countries their ancestors came from, but they came here because it's a fair society. That's the main appeal of America, not a robust economy, but the fact that we're all equal under the law.  

That's the one thing other countries don't have and we do or did. So, there's a double standard and everyone sees it and it's not just the level of bodega owners, it goes to the very top of the Democratic Party, to its top candidates. In South Carolina, for example, Democrats have nominated a Senate candidate, U.S. Senate, called Krystle Matthews. Krystle Matthews was caught on tape recently by James O'Keefe's group, Project Veritas, openly advocating for punishing people because they're the wrong skin color. Not exaggerating. Here's the tape.  

Got to hurt White people or they won't respect you. She said that. That video is real and yet somehow no one seems to have noticed. Krystle Matthews is not on the front page of The New York Times this morning. There was no Justice Department investigation into her. That's weird and everyone knows it's weird, but it's hardly the only shocking news story that's not being covered as a news story. Also missing from mainstream coverage is this video from Memphis of young criminal promising to murder White people because of their skin color.  

So, that video was recorded just a day after the rampage, the murder rampage in the same city Memphis, committed by a felon called Ezekiel Kelly. Ezekiel Kelly, like so many people who've committed murder recently, was let out of jail early. but no one in charge in the Democratic Party in Memphis even bothered by that. In fact, while he was killing people, a state representative in Tennessee, a Democrat called Antonio Parkinson, complained that the real problem was police might hurt Ezekiel Kelly. That was his main concern. ""This is unbelievable. Ezekiel Kelly will probably be killed tonight at the hands of police. We are losing our children,"" he wrote.  

Really? That's your concern? So, in all three of these stories, we've just reminded you of the bodega owner in New York, Krystle Matthews in South Carolina, the anti-White violence in Memphis, no one's noticing. Joe Biden's DOJ is standing back and doing nothing. In other words, they're allowing violent race hate to flourish in the United States at the same time they are telling you White supremacy is the biggest threat we face. This is terrifying on many levels, but above all, once again, it is an attack not on any specific ethnic group, but on a principle that protects all of us and that's the principle of equal justice under the law.  

If you move to the United States from Latin America hoping to live under a fair justice system, this might bother you and a lot of people are bothered. They didn't want to live in Honduras. That's why they moved here and yet no one in Washington on either side, the Democrats who are making this possible, the Republicans who are still yammering on about criminal justice reform seem to understand this. But you know who does understand? The Hispanic immigrants. They understand it very well. They see that it's not safe anywhere. Anywhere, not just in the so-called bad neighborhoods, but in the so-called nice neighborhoods, the ones they live in or want to live in. This video is from Sunday. It was taken in a Chicago suburb called Lakeview. Three men attack a woman on the sidewalk in front of her home. Watch this.  

You see that? That's not some scary neighborhood a roll-em-up neighborhood. That's the neighborhood you live in, or you want to live in. That's the neighborhood you picture when you think middle America. It's a nice, leafy neighborhood. That could be your daughter attacked on the sidewalk in front of your house. That's happening and it's going to get a lot worse if we don't pull back now, but they're not pulling back. The Democratic Party is doubling down. In January, police in the state of Illinois will be banned from removing trespassers from your property. The Democrat-controlled legislature just passed that law. Effectively, they have legalized home invasions and there will likely be many more of those because starting next year, the Safety Act just passed in Illinois will let violent felons out of jail with no bail – actual violent felons, people who committed crimes like second degree murder and arson and kidnaping.  

What will happen then? Well, I think we know because it's been tried in other places like New York City, where people are regularly shot, beaten and robbed in public, People who could not be held behind bars because Democrats decided that was mean. They're worried about the criminals and not worried about you. And once again, to restate, if you siloed Hispanic voters into this one specific group whose concerns are totally different from everyone else's you're missing the thread. That's not true. Hispanic voters like every other voter, every voter of every race, they don't like crime and violence, but it's everywhere. These clips are all from the last month. 

What country is this? It didn't used to be America. This is not organic. We didn't used to live like this. Liberals did this. They did this on purpose. They created more crime. It didn't just happen, and the numbers couldn't be clearer on that. Any Republican running for office this cycle, which is to say the month after next, who wasn't running on this, is an idiot because everyone knows it's happening of all colors.  

Just today local media in New York reported that a 21-year-old tourist was kidnaped and raped on a subway platform by a stranger. Are you shocked by that? You shouldn't be. That's what happens when you stop enforcing the law. That's what happens when you put the interests of criminals above those of citizens. Everyone can see what's happening, no matter what color they are. Democrats should not be surprised when they are punished for this.

Yesterday marked the . That was, as you know, the single deadliest terror attack in all recorded history. If you're over 30, you did not need to be reminded. You remember it vividly. 9/11 changed America completely and changed it forever. Nothing has been the same here since, especially the relationship between Americans and their government.  

A decade ago, the New York Times admitted this. The Times marked the anniversary of 9/11 by publishing a piece on the rise of domestic surveillance abuses, which exploded after the 9/11 attacks. The Patriot Act, according to the New York Times, ""quickly became a sort of shorthand for government abuse and overreaching,"" which ""inflicted collateral damage on political dissent, religious liberty and the freedom of association."" That is still true, in fact, truer than it's ever been, and it is still a tragedy.  

What's fascinating is that The New York Times has stopped acknowledging it. In fact, remarkably, there was not a single mention of the 9/11 anniversary on the front page of yesterday's paper, the paper that purports to represent New York, the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks. Now, why would the New York Times ignore 9/11? Well, good question, because The New York Times and the tiny leadership class it panders to and in fact represents now wholeheartedly endorses the nationwide crackdown on civil liberties that 9/11 made possible and why wouldn't they endorse it? They're benefiting from it. It's how they keep power. So, for them, in retrospect, 9/11 was less a tragedy than it was an opportunity and if you don't believe that, watch how Joe Biden, the president of the United States, commemorated that anniversary yesterday.

It's not about the past. It's about the future. This was in a speech that was supposed to mark the anniversary of the deaths of thousands of Americans at the hands of foreign adversaries. So, when Joe Biden speaks about the future, you should listen. The future of what? Don't focus on the dead. Focus on what I want to do. OK, but what is it that Joe Biden wants to do? Fight Islamic terrorism? No. Protect democracy. But what exactly is this democracy that Joe Biden speaks of? Why won't he define it ever? And how exactly is that democracy imperiled? These are pivotal questions and for answers, we're going to turn to the source. That would be Chuck Todd of NBC News when practice is a slightly more articulate version of Biden publicist Karine Jean-Pierre.  

If you want to know what the Biden administration is really thinking, listen to the guy with the comb over in the anchor chair at NBC. Here is his exchange with Kamala Harris, the sitting vice president yesterday.  

So, you're slack-jawed watching something like this. Did I just see that? And I'm quoting ""I began by asking the vice president about how over two decades our focus has had to shift from foreign terror to the threat within."" The threat within? What does that mean? What the hell are you talking about, you freaking lunatic? There is no group of Americans anywhere in the United States half as dangerous as the 9/11 hijackers. To suggest otherwise is literally insane. Drawing a parallel between the election justice  and the fall of the Twin Towers – true lunacy, but Kamala Harris didn't even pause, almost like the whole question was a setup. She just nodded. This unspecified internal threat, she confirmed, is in fact, just like Al-Qaeda, ""very dangerous and very harmful."" 

You may be wondering at this point, what is this threat since we've just declared a new war on terror, but against whom? Who is the threat? Well, of course, it's you and anyone else in the way of the Biden administration, and especially as the vice president just said and you saw it, anyone who questions the legitimacy of the last election, but wait a second, you ask, didn't  herself call the 2016 presidential election illegitimate? Your memory is not failing. Yes, she did and so did every leader of the Democratic Party and they will say the same to this day and yet she is telling us, the sitting vice president, that anyone who questions the 2020 election should be in jail. Watch.  

So again, that's the sitting vice president who they tell us over and over—and you just heard her say it—received more votes than any vice president in history and if you don't believe that (and there are reasons not to believe that) if you don't believe that, you're like Mohamed Atta, your beliefs are acts of terror. You're comparable to a mass murderer and you need to be pursued by law enforcement. They're saying that. She just said the greatest threat to our country is that Republicans might be elected to statewide office in 11 states. That's comparable to 9/11. Is no one noticing this? The Biden administration's message, and of course, as it always is, completely consistent across the board on 9/11, on the anniversary of 911, was that any American who disapproves of Joe Biden's performance is a terrorist. Here's the DHS Secretary Mayorkas:

Is no one paying attention to this? Does no one see this happening? That's the DHS secretary saying that opinions he doesn't agree with expressed online, which most of us thought were constitutionally protected, in fact, we thought that was the whole reason we lived here. That's why this is a different nation from, say, Iran, but the fact that people have different political opinions, including about the last election, Stacey Abrams has spent the last five years saying she's the rightful governor of Georgia, we think she's a lunatic. We also believe that view is constitutionally protected. There's the DHS secretary saying those people are Al-Qaeda. This is terrifying and it's not just words. They're acting and they're acting at scale. It was just a few weeks ago, on Thursday, September 1, two months before the midterm elections, not an incidental fact that Joe Biden declared his political opponents enemies of the state. You remember it. Here's a clip:

So, the upside of having a senile president is that no one takes him very seriously and so it's possible for the rest of us to see something like that, a declaration of war on an entire political party in a two-party system, which would leave this, if we were to follow his urging, a one-party state. It's very easy to dismiss that as the ramblings of a man who has no idea what he's saying and a lot of people did and yet the very next day, the morning after Joe Biden delivered that speech at 8:30 a.m, a woman called Lisa Gallagher was sick in bed at her home in suburban New Jersey.  

Her daughter came upstairs and told her that the FBI was waiting outside. Now, Lisa Gallagher is not a criminal, never has been. She is an active Trump supporter, particularly on Facebook. She did Trump (flag on her lawn). She's a patriotic American. She describes herself as a rule follower. She's never once been in trouble with the law at any level, and she had nothing whatsoever to do with January 6 and yet, outside her door with three FBI agents with guns. ""We got an anonymous tip you were at the Capitol on January 6."" That's what they said. Gallagher was terrified. ""I thought they were going to take me out of here in handcuffs,"" she told the show this morning.  

Ultimately, her husband came home and the two of them showed the FBI agents her daily calendars from January of 2021 and finally convinced the agents that she was not at the Capitol that day. Imagine armed FBI agents showing up at your house because you supported Trump on Facebook and demanding records of your whereabouts on a date nearly two years ago and of course, the FBI already knew that Lisa Gallagher was not there because they have sophisticated facial recognition software, so they were never planning to arrest her. The point (and this is a theme in every authoritarian regime), the point was to use government agents to intimidate enemies of the regime on the basis of an anonymous tip. ""I have never been so frightened in my life,"" Lisa Gallagher said.  

The rest of us should feel the same way. Snitches? Anonymous snitches? The secret police showing up at your door when you're in bed? This is Soviet and there's no other word for it. But it's not just Lisa Gallagher. The same thing is happening to dozens, maybe scores of other supporters of the former president.  

Amy Kremer, for example, is a former Tea Party member and a candidate for the House of Representatives. She also obtained special permits for the National Park Service, which authorized Donald Trump's rally on January 6, 2021. To be perfectly clear, Amy Kremer never went to the Capitol on that day. She never encouraged anyone else to go, either. But for the crime of organizing a lawful political event, an election justice rally protected by the Constitution, Amy Kremer is now being terrorized by Merrick Garland's DOJ.  

On Wednesday morning, FBI agents showed up at her home, first at the home of her ex-husband, carrying a subpoena for her daughter Kylie. Kremer received a call from Kylie's stepmother saying, ""The FBI is here for her."" The FBI subpoenaed demands, all communications from Amy Kremer and Kylie, including their social media posts (what) from October 1st, 2020 to the present day.  

Now, why would the FBI, Joe Biden's FBI need Amy Kremer’s daughter's Instagram posts? Because this isn't about the events leading up to January 6. Obviously, it's about mining all of her personal information. This is harassment on political grounds. It's illegal. It's unconstitutional. It shocks the conscience of everyone who sees it, but the number of people who see it is very small because it is not covered by any media and it's not just happening to Amy Kremer. This show has obtained a subpoena from Merrick Garland's DOJ issued in the past week and what it demands is both unlawful and without precedent in American history. The subpoena claims to be investigating, ""any claim that the vice president and/or president of the Senate had the authority to reject or choose not to count presidential electors."" 

Now keep in mind that any claim you make as an American citizen about electors, any claim you make about American politics, period, is protected explicitly under the First Amendment. That's our core freedom. It's why we live here. It's why we're proud to be Americans. It's why so many American servicemen died protecting our country. Those are the freedoms that they fought to preserve. That's why nobody prosecuted leading Democrats in 2016 when they sought to reject electors for Donald Trump. Right. It's why none of those people, including Kamala Harris, is now in jail.

But right now, according to the subpoena that we have obtained, Merrick Garland's DOJ is demanding all communication from the following people on this topic and let's be clear before we read their names, that it is not clear what the investigation is actually about and that's the most terrifying part. 

What is this? On what grounds are you demanding my private communications with people? They never say but included in this precedent-breaking sweep of political opponents of the Biden White House would be former White House adviser Bernie Kerik, who was the former police commissioner of New York City; Boris Epshteyn, who is the current attorney for Donald Trump (At no time in American history has it been okay to grab the personal communications of someone's lawyer because those are privileged. Not anymore.) Matt Morgan; Justin Clark; Kenneth Chesebro and Mike Roman; RNC official Joshua Findlay; Trump Attorneys John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Joe DiGenova, James Troupis, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Victoria Toensing, Cleta Mitchell, and Bruce Marks. We could go on and on and on and on. 

The DOJ is now going after former White House official Stephen Miller, a frequent guest on this show, with a subpoena. Why? Well, it could be because Stephen Miller went on this network and said, ""If we win these cases in the courts, then we can direct the alternate state of electors are certified."" 

In other words, he didn't call for the insurrection, much less violence or a coup. He called for alternate electors to be seated if the court ordered them to be seated. In other words, he was following the constitutionally prescribed process post-election. He's doing what is supposed to do. He was following the rules, but under Joe Biden, that apparently is now a crime. By the way, every one of these people has to hire lawyers to defend him or herself and a lot of them at this point, after two years of harassment by Joe Biden, can't afford it.  

In addition, we should say, we've obtained the subpoena, this subpoena goes on to demand the communications from dozens of other Republicans and people who have spoken to them, including State Representative Jake Hoffman in Arizona, Republican National Committee member Kathleen Berden in Michigan, former U.S. Representative Lou Barletta in the state of Pennsylvania and Republican State Party Secretary James DeGraffenreid in Nevada, among dozens and dozens of others.  

So, what is this about? It can't possibly be about January 6, the fake insurrection, the only insurrection in history with no guns, the insurrection in which the only person shot to death was a Trump supporter. No, the point of this is to suppress political dissent, to hobble an entire political party and to keep any of these people from ever participating in American politics again and by the way, the cost to each one of these individuals or to any person at whose house the FBI shows up is enormous. Ask anybody you saw the FBI showed up with guns at their home what that's like. By accusing these people of insurrection for asking questions about electors by comparing them to Confederate soldiers, Merrick Garland's DOJ plans to disenfranchise them if not jail them. Really? 

So, prohibit people from participating in American politics in the name of democracy? Too ironic to be real? Oh, it's real. It Just happened in New Mexico. A state judge in New Mexico just removed an elected county commissioner from office, overturning the will of the voters. Why? Because he had dared to exercise his constitutional rights by participating in the election justice protest on January 6. So, this is a full-blown political purge. That's not a talking point. It is not in any sense a conspiracy theory. It's completely real and it began shortly after January 6 when Republicans, as usual, just as they were after the death of George Floyd, were so blown back, so intimidated by the aggression of the rhetoric from the other side that they let it happen.

And because they let it happen, as with the BLM riots, its effects are accelerating now. So, if you're accused of supporting Joe Biden's political opponents, you could be visited by armed agents from Joe Biden's FBI. As you reported last year in our documentary, which was mocked, turned out to be prescient, it has happened to people living as far away as remote Homer, Alaska.  

So, why is this happening? Because no one pushed back against it. Why did the lunatics get to defund the police, something that no normal person supported, the overwhelming majority of Americans never supported them, but they did it anyway. How did they get to do that? Because there is no opposition, no one pushed back. George Floyd died. They started screaming, calling everyone a racist and everyone just obeyed their most ludicrous demands.  

January 6 is exactly the same thing. ""It was an insurrection. It was a racist insurrection."" No, it wasn't. What are you talking about? No one said that. No one pushed back at all. So, it got completely out of control, and at this point, it's not just a threat to the Republican Party. On one level, a lot of conservatives say, ""Well, who cares? Mitch McConnell is inconvenienced? No one cares."" 

That's not what it's about. It's a threat to the American system. This kind of behavior, politicized federal law enforcement, is a threat to democracy. It's a threat to the system we live under. It's a threat to everything we have that's valuable. We cannot allow this, but no one's even mentioning it.

Imagine dystopia. You hear that word frequently. What does it mean? Picture it in your mind's eye. Dystopia is a world where the police will not protect you. They refuse. And at the same time, you are not allowed to protect yourself. So, who does that leave in charge? Who runs a world like that? Well, young men with guns. They're in charge— the cruelest and most violent element of any society, the people with the least to lose, the shortest time horizons, the shallow reservoirs of impulse control. People like that have all the power.  

You have no power and that means that everything you have is theirs. That's the end of civilization. It exists in pockets around the world, Mogadishu, famously, but if you think it's confined to Mogadishu, you haven't been to Chicago lately. This past Friday, just before noon, a 30-year-old man called Ryan King walked out of a gym in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood. Bucktown is a former Polish enclave just west of Lincoln Park. That's one of the nicest parts of the city. Real estate websites describe Bucktown as young and hip, a place where recent college graduates who can pay above average rents might live. It's where your kids might live with their friends as they start their first jobs. That's how most people think of Bucktown, people who haven't been there recently. 

But local news accounts suggest a very different reality. ""Shots fired during Bucktown robbery. Man shot during robbery attempt in Bucktown. Bucktown couple shares account of armed robbery"" and so on and on, many stories like this. Ryan King probably wasn't thinking of armed robbery as he walked out of the gym on Friday. It was broad daylight. It was a weekday, but then a car pulled up right next to him. Three young men jumped out and stuck a gun in his face. Here's an account from a local FOX station in Chicago. 

Again, broad daylight, middle of the day, nice neighborhood in one of America's biggest cities. So, what happened next? Well, according to reporting by CWB Chicago, just minutes after Ryan King was threatened with death for daring to walk outside in his own neighborhood, Chicago police spotted the gunman's vehicle, but there was nothing they could do about it. Their supervisor ordered them not to pursue it, so the criminals just drove off and, of course, they committed more violent crimes. 

In the hours after Ryan King was attacked, 16 more armed robberies were reported in the area. Police believe at least two organized armed gangs are operating with impunity around Bucktown, which means the gangs are in charge now. That's what the collapse of civilization looks like. But it's now normal in Chicago. According to data from the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper last year, police made arrests in just 12% of reported . That's the lowest level recorded in Chicago history and that is what it means when politicians hand control of a city to criminals. ""Here. you run it."" 

In Chicago right now, taxpayers are more likely to be the victims of crime than criminals are to be punished for it. So, the question is, why would anyone in Chicago pay taxes? You'd have to be a masochist to do that and pretty soon only the masochists will be. 

So, how did this happen? It's no mystery. There are many threads, but George Soros is a big one. Soros paid for this to happen. Soros backed a prosecutor called Kim Foxx, who turns Chicago over to the most vicious people who live there—not the decent, good people in all neighborhoods—the most vicious, antisocial people, the ones who truly don't care about others, who are willing to kill people for their shoes or their car, the worst people, and they run things now. This is from our FOX station, Chicago.  

 So we ask you, Kim Foxx, how much longer do our families need to suffer in pain and sorrow with no justice for our loved ones being served?  

  

You think Kim Foxx cares? You think she's watching? You think those scenes like that penetrate at all? The shell of self-esteem that surrounds her? No, of course not. She doesn't care at all. It's why she did it in the first place. Someone should take action immediately on that, but she's not the only person who did this. The federal government also played a role and you probably didn't know what was happening. Over the eight years of the Barack Obama administration, the Department of Justice forced more than a dozen police departments around the country to introduce something called ""consent decrees."" Chicago was one of them. The Obama administration began an investigation into the Chicago Police Department and they got a consent decree. 

Now, all of these decrees took the same form, they pronounced police departments guilty of racism if those departments disproportionately interact with African-Americans, regardless of whether those interactions were legally justified. In other words, the law is entirely irrelevant to the consent decree and so is reality itself. Here's a line from the DOJ consent decree imposed under Obama against Chicago. ""Raw statistics show that CPD (Chicago Police Department) uses force almost ten times more often against Blacks than against Whites."" OK, that's one data point. It's not the whole story. It doesn't begin to tell the whole story. There was no analysis whatsoever about whether the use of force in these specific cases was justified, none. So, this is not science. They may have graphs. It's not science. It's some kind of crazed race ideology. It's the equity agenda and in effect and this, of course, was the intended effect, these consent decrees have been a disaster for the people of these cities. 

Even in New Orleans (whose mayor as we've told you many times has driven that city, that beautiful city which is worth saving, right into the sewer), even the Democratic mayor of New Orleans said recently, and we're quoting ""the consent decrees handcuff our officers."" That's an understatement. At this point, New Orleans is essentially out of police officers. The median police response time in New Orleans to 911 calls is over two hours. Imagine armed people in your home. You call the police, two hours. A lot can happen in two hours. That's the total collapse of civilization. 

There's no reason to have a government if the response time is two hours. Buy your own guns, establish your own order. That's all going to be very soon. On a recent Friday night in that city, New Orleans, one third year officer called Scott Fanning just quit mid-shift. Here's how he described it. ""That night I quit. There were over 40 calls holding when I logged into my computer, but there were only 35 patrol officers logged in for all eight districts in the city. Some nights there has literally been one person"" in a big, dangerous city. 

But it's not just New Orleans. All over the country, police officers are quitting and they're not being replaced.  

Oh, did you hear that? So, the forces of compassion, of caring, the people who have much more evolved consciences than you do, the people put coexist in bumper stickers on their Subarus. Those people defunded the animal cruelty unit in Los Angeles so dogs can get tortured to death and nobody cares and people, too and the cops who remain on those forces, by and large, don't want to work there, because who would want to work there for any amount of money? 

Terrorizing the police with threats of prosecution if they do their jobs. That's what the Democratic Party has done, and the effect has been what it was intended to be, depopulating police departments. Crime surged. So, in the end, they didn't tell you this, but they succeeded in getting rid of the police.

And now politicians are just admitting it out loud in a lot of places. They've decided just legalize crime. Here's the mayor of Orland Park, Illinois, Keith Pekau, describing the state's new ""SAFE-T"" Act. Watch this.:

So, how is this working exactly? Is it such a Low-T country that no one's going to do anything about this? Politicians in Illinois just legalized  against you, and no one's done anything about it. A lot of these people are going to be reelected in November. Really? How does that work? Where is the constituency for violent crime in this country, is there really one? Is there anyone who is for it other than like Kamala Harris, Ron Klain, and the ideologues who run this administration? Most people are not for it. Even most Democrats are not for it. The SAFE-T act of Illinois stands for ""Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today."" 

So, the reason they're doing this is because they didn't like the demographic breakdown of the people who were getting arrested for crimes. Period. ""This can't be happening."" Therefore, they're just going to redefine it away. It was ideologically inconvenient for them. So, the solution is to just legalize murder and kidnappings and trespassing and at the same time, you are not allowed to notice that an awful lot of these cases appear to be (it's hard to know and you never want to think it), but they appear to be motivated by racial animus. They do. That's just true. Again, no one wants to think that, but there are so many videos of it. Consider the horrific attack, really an attempted murder on a student at West Brook High School in Beaumont, Texas, really recently beaten and nearly killed in a bathroom at school. What did he do wrong exactly? We don't know. We can only guess.

That just can't be allowed in a civilized country. We cannot allow that or anything like it to happen in our country. This is more important than anything else that's happening because that's someone's child, but everyone just stands by in our country and lets it happen and in that video in the men's room, everyone stood by and just filmed it, snickered. The attacker, of course, is a repeat offender. He'd already been busted, went to jail. They put him back in school and that'll happen again. You'll never know his name. He's a juvenile attacker, so he has a right to go to school. What about the other kids in school? They have no rights. So, that means the bathroom at that school in Beaumont, Texas, which is in the United States, is a pretty civilized place, you can't go there anymore. That's equity. 

Having trouble eating out, too? Restaurants are suddenly out of control. Anyone noticing this? Here's footage of a robbery at a restaurant in Los Angeles from May. Unbelievable.  

Then there's this. This is from Providence. This broke out recently, this scene at a place called Mi Sueño Restaurant, completely out of control. Who has to deal with this? Well, people who have no choice but to eat at middlebrow restaurants and don't have their own But the rich don't have to deal with it because they know exactly what's going on. 

 In many cases, they vote for the politicians who do this and then they get people to protect them armed with guns. You're not allowed to have that because they have high-capacity magazines. In New Orleans, a real estate developer called Sidney Torres created his own police force. He pays his dispatchers 20 grand a month. We're not attacking him. He probably had no choice. In Greenwich Village, Manhattan, residents and businesses are paying $18,000 for two officers to patrol every month. They're doing it. Why? Because they want to spend the money? No, they pay taxes in order to be protected, but they have no choice because police have abandoned New York City too. 

  

So, these crimes are so appalling. They're attacks not just on individuals, but against civilization and humanity itself, that they at this point really do require an immense and organized nonviolent civil disobedience campaign. So, just pick one of those videos at random. Who's the prosecutor with that person out, refused to charge them in the first place? Who's the politician who decided that attacker had more rights than the old lady he was beating up? 

Why aren’t 15,000 people blocking that person's office or chain themselves to the front door of it demanding an answer again? Why isn't there massive, nonviolent civil disobedience that can change this? Barking about it on cable news clearly isn't working. We've been doing it for five years. By the way it's not ""we give you examples from L.A., Chicago, New York, and you think to yourself, ‘Well, yeah, those are big cities. I left. I opted out. I went somewhere nice and beautiful, somewhere like Asheville, North Carolina, up in the mountains, a famously beautiful place’."" You think you can get away from this in Asheville, North Carolina, the once beautiful mountain town? Oh, no, you can't, because it's there, too.  

In 2013, Asheville elected a new mayor, a lawyer called Esther Manheimer,. She had the now mandatory, complicated eyeglasses that all the girl bosses now wear. Manheimer, was never especially interested in running the city of Asheville. That was very obvious. She didn't talk much about Asheville. She talked about (Can you guess? Can you guess?) climate change and equity and by the way, anyone who talks about climate change and equity is immediately disqualified from getting your vote. That should be the rule right there. That's a baseline. Climate change and equity? No, sorry, you're a lunatic.  

So, by the way, under Manheimer’s leadership Asheville promised $2.1 million in reparations to Black residents. Really? How does that work and how did it all work out? Well, here are the bottom-line numbers. From 2016 to 2020, violent crime in Asheville and up by 31%. Asheville is a beautiful place. It should have no crime, but it has a lot now. ""Climate change! Equity!"" Really? Now we have a lot of carjackings in Asheville. Overall, car thefts went up nearly 20% just last year across the country and they went up in Asheville. So, did this happened by accident. If all the politicians are talking about climate change and equity and life for you gets worse every single year, maybe they're doing it on purpose. Here's footage from Wisconsin, Philadelphia and Detroit.  

So why is this continuing? It's been going on for more than two years since George Floyd died in Minneapolis, Memorial Day 2020. Why is it continuing? Why has no one stopped it? 

Because there's no one to stop it. Dad is gone. There is no one in charge with a normal testosterone level who's willing to just say, ""Mo, you're not allowed to do this. I'm sorry. You can't do that. That's against the law. This is a country of laws. Nothing personal, we don't care what you look like. That's not allowed and if you do, we're going to spank you hard so you don't do it again.""  

In other words, no one has shown up with clear and reasonable rules and enforced them consistently. When that happens, everybody calms down. That's true in the family, and it's true in the nation. And if you don't have that, you have chaos. Armed robbers suddenly have a right to be on your property. Murderers get out without bail. What are we looking at? We’re looking at a war on the population, and it's time for real change. This is completely intolerable.

728	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-language-totalitarianism	2022-09-14 22:11:00	TUCKER CARLSON: This is the language of totalitarianism | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson analyzes how members of both parties have questioned the outcome of presidential elections on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Man, things are moving fast. So much is going on, as we often say, that it's very easy to lose track of the big things, the things that matter, the things that will define history and the lives of our children and grandchildren, but Joe Biden's now famous blood red speech of September 1 certainly qualifies as one of the big things.  

In that speech, Biden announced that not only is his program the best for this country (That's conventional. presidents always say that.) Biden told us that going forward, his program is the only program allowed in this country. Competing programs are not allowed anymore. They're illegitimate. In fact, they're dangerous, Biden said. They're a threat to the republic itself.  

With an  just months away, Joe Biden declared that his political opponents are enemies of the state. They're terrorists in fact. Comparable, as his vice president later explained to NBC News, to al-Qaeda on 9/11. Now, Biden and Harris said this. They didn't say it in private, grousing bitterly to aides in the Oval Office looking at their declining poll numbers. They said it in public on television and they didn't even flinch as they did.  

So, you have to think about the implications of this. The United States has a two-party political system, has for our whole lifetimes. If the leader of one party who happens to be the president redefines the other party not as a political party, but as a criminal organization, what is he doing? Well, of course, he is demanding a one-party state, and that's what Biden is doing and he's using federal law enforcement to make it happen. 

So, the question is, how is he getting away with it? And he's getting away with it by changing the terms. You can't just say openly, ""I want a one-party state with me at the head."" No, you have to make the other side unacceptable. So, when Biden talks about Trump voters, he doesn't talk about voters or Americans. He describes an insurgency. He implies an armed rebellion, not unlike the Confederate Army. Trump voters, Biden tells us, aren't just wrong. They tried to overthrow the U.S. government and you can't debate people like that. You have to crush them.  

Democratic leaders across the board appear to believe this. Tim Ryan, who is running for the Senate as a Democrat from Ohio, just yesterday told ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC, ""We've got to kill and confront that movement."" Not defeat it, kill it. That's how dangerous populist Republicans are, according to the Biden White House. 

This is the language of totalitarianism. It's very obvious and in a functioning system that wanted to remain democratic, people in power would push back against it. The media, business, any responsible person would say, ""No, you can't do that. That's too much power. We can't vest all the power in one political party. That's the road to something awful.""

But no one's pushing back. In fact, daily, the media reinforce the message. Daily, the media remind us that anyone who has questions about the outcome of the last election isn't a disgruntled voter. That person is a criminal. That person has embraced the big lie. You see it in every news story ""the big lie."" People like that are irrational and dangerous and they will be punished and rightly so and now they are being punished.  

Yesterday afternoon, FBI agents apprehended a man called Mike Lindell at a Hardee's drive thru in Minnesota and they seized his personal cell phone the one he does business on. Mike Lindell is not a wanted criminal. He's not even a public official. Mike Lindell, as you likely know, sells pillows, especially on this channel. So why would the FBI, armed FBI agents be apprehending Mike Lindell? Because he questioned the outcome of the last election. He participated in the big lie. He’s a threat to the system. That is the consensus view in Washington now. 

This is a very big change. In a free society, by definition, all questions are allowed. You can't have a democracy unless you are allowed to discuss its mechanics. Free speech is a prerequisite for a democratic system, obviously and until very recently, everyone in America unquestioningly understood that. Dissent was not a crime. It was a patriotic act and people committed it at scale, especially Democrats. 

For years after the 2000 election, Democrats claim that George W. Bush was not the legitimate president. Some still say it. They may believe it and then in 2016, the entire Democratic Party rejected the outcome of the presidential election. A foreign power got Donald Trump elected. Democrats said that and they continued to say it every single day of Donald Trump's term. They impeached him over it. They hamstrung the executive branch of the U.S. government with an investigation into Russian influence that in the end turned up nothing.  

What would you call that? You would call that election denial. You call that the big lie, but no one was punished for it. No judge removed Adam Schiff from office for doubting the election results. The FBI didn't raid CNN's biggest advertisers. Everyone just moved on. You may have hated the Russia hoax, and we certainly did, but there was never any question that all American citizens have an absolute, constitutionally protected right to question election outcomes and by the way, you weren't even allowed, maybe even encouraged to question the mechanics of voting. Why wouldn't you question them? Voting is the means by which huge amounts of money and power are transferred from one party to another.  

There is an awful lot at stake at the richest, most powerful country in the world. So, of course, Americans have an absolute right to see proof, not suggestions, but proof that the system is on the level and when they are denied that right, maybe it's a sign the system isn't on the level. Once again, that used to be obvious. Well, certainly obvious to Democrats. 

Here's a clip you may not have seen before. This is the current vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, speaking not so long ago, June 2018, about the integrity of electronic voting machines.  was a senator then. Watch this.:

Oh. Kamala Harris publicly raising questions about the integrity of voting machines. Well, you know what didn't happen next. The FBI did not trap Kamala Harris at a Hardee's to seize her cell phone. No one in the media called her an insurrectionist and honestly, whatever you think of Kamala Harris, why would they? If you actually cared about democracy and the trust in the system that is a prerequisite for democracy, you would encourage all questions from U.S. citizens about how your democracy was administered. You would never censor those questions ever. You would never punish the people who ask those questions, ever. Even news organizations once understood this not so long ago. 

During the Trump years, CNN published a video entitled ""We Watched Hackers Break into Voting Machines."" Oh, that was allowed then. CBS ran a report entitled ""How Electronic Voting Machines Could Hack Your Vote."" Oh, really? Did the FBI come after you at Hardee's? No, they didn't. That's what news organizations used to do: ask obvious questions, make sure everything works. If there's corruption, we'll sniff it out. We're going to reassure you that your vote counts. You have to be reassured or else the system collapses. You can't just tell people to shut up, ban them from Twitter and arrest them. And once again, even Democrats understood that. 

In 2019, a couple of them, Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner of Virginia, wrote to the makers of election systems complaining about potential security vulnerabilities. ""There has been a lack of meaningful innovation in the election vendor industry, and our democracy is paying the price."" Is that true? Honestly, we have no idea. We're not endorsing that view then or now. We're merely saying it is not a crime to ask. In fact, it is a prerequisite if you want to have a healthy system that people are allowed to ask and the people who are asked are required to show proof, to reassure them. Of course. But now Democrats and the media who serve them are pretending that no one ever asks questions like this until 2020 ever. It never happened before. Watch. 

Oh, the rule of law. So, the rule of law, the new law is ""shut up."" Right. They were telling you it was a ""free and fair election"" about which no debate was allowed the day Joe Biden was certified the winner, the day. Right. Before they could know, in other words. So that's Joe Biden's new position. Here's the same and we checked it, this is the same Joe Biden, a little dimmer, but still the same guy today back in 2019. 

Oh, faced with an election denier who violates the rule of law and our sacred norms in public on camera.  doesn't scold her. He doesn't call for the FBI to trap her at Hardee's and seize her personal communications device. He jokingly offers to reward her. We're so on the same page we could run together. but he didn't run with that election denier. He ran with this one.  

That clip is from three years ago. This is how insane the conversation we're having is right now. No one seems to remember that. It was just Sunday. It's Wednesday. This Sunday, like three days ago that that same person, Kamala Harris, did a taped interview with NBC News and Chuck Todd, the comb over guy, to explain that Republicans who have the same questions about the last election that she had about the election before, that should not be allowed to hold office. It's a threat to the republic that they are running for office. In other words, democracy is a threat to democracy. This is the currency of the Democratic Party and has been for years. Lose the election, immediately question the election. Stacey Abrams anyone? 

We can show you dozens and dozens and dozens of clips like this, not from small time people, from Kamala Harris, from Hillary Clinton, from Karine Jean-Pierre. You get the point. This is crazy, but under Joe Biden, the Department of Justice appears to be doing everything it can to criminalize questions about the last election. Complain about election fraud, the FBI might show up. The DOJ's much broader effort, it's not simply about a contested election in Mesa County, Arizona. Their effort is based on what they claim was a scheme to install alternate electors who would vote for Donald Trump in 2020 instead of Joe Biden. This is the core of their case. This is DOJ's apparent justification for crushing citizens and crushing dissent, seizing the cell phones of dozens of Trump allies, including his personal attorney, which was never allowed, but they just did it.  

As CNN recently reported, the DOJ is investigating Donald Trump's ""fraudulent electors plot."" That's the new name for it. The fraudulent electors plot, well that sounds bad. That sounds like a threat to democracy. What exactly is a fraudulent elector?  

Well, it turns out that what CNN is telling you is a fraudulent elector is actually called an alternate elector and that is not a new phenomenon. They've been around for generations. On election night in 1960, for example, Richard Nixon was running against Jack Kennedy. The state of Hawaii appeared to be going narrowly for Nixon, and that's when the state sent several slates of alter electors to Congress. Nixon's electors cast three votes in an official ceremony. At the same time. Kennedy's three electors met in secret. They signed their own unofficial electoral certificates and sent those to Washington. 

Then, after a recount determined that Kennedy had won the state, Kennedy's electors sent a third set of certificates. That's the set that the governor of Hawaii ultimately certified and John Kennedy became president. So, the question is, were Kennedy's alternate electors raided by the feds at Hardee's for seeing their first set of certificates, even though their candidate was losing? Were their communications subpoenaed? Were their lives disturbed? Were they bankrupted with legal fees? No.  

In fact, a state judge called Ronald Jamieson endorsed what the Kennedy electors had done. He said that by sending an alternative elevation certificate, even when they were losing in the vote count, Kennedy's electors, all of them Democrats, had taken an important step, one that preserved their win after the recount. That's how the system works. That's how the system works. So, after the 2020 election, Trump electors in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Nevada use virtually the same language as Kennedy's Hawaii's electors had used in 1960, but this time, these were not alternate electors. They were criminals. This is part of a criminal plot to overthrow the U.S. government. They were insurrectionists. They were trying to interfere with the work of the real electors and that too is a novel crime because as of five years ago, interfering with the work of real electors was not just fine. In fact, it was your patriotic duty.  

Remember this? No one remembers anything, but we have Google on this show. So, we recall that as Politico reported at the time, after Donald Trump's win in 2016, Democratic electors were, ""lobbying their Republican counterparts in other states to reject their oaths and in some cases, state law to vote against Trump."" Democrats embraced this effort at the time. They even voted, and again, this wasn't in the 1860s. This was like 20 minutes ago. They voted to reject Trump's electors. Watch.  

Now, to be clear, we're not endorsing that. We weren't for it at the time. We probably mocked it as it happened. You can pull the tape. It's on the Internet, but that was not an insurrection. That was not an insurrection, period. That was not an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government and neither was January 6. and anyone who says otherwise is a liar with motives that that person doesn't care to describe out loud because they're dark motives.  

If you're going to have a functioning country, a free society, a democracy, you have to have equal justice under the law and in that case, no Democrat had his or her home raided by the FBI for doing this. None of them were removed from elected office by judges. It's too much and they're so aggressive about it and the threat of federal law enforcement is so omnipresent that they've effectively silenced all opposition and the few who are speaking out about it are a real threat to the people in charge, not simply because they are trying to relitigate the last election – that's over. But because they're brave enough to say what they really think. That's the point. They're brave enough to stand up for their constitutional right to free speech and in that category we would add Kari Lake. She's the Republican nominee for governor of Arizona and she makes a very good point in this clip. Watch. 

Yeah, exactly. It's about free speech. At this point, we may never know and certainly partisans on both sides will probably never know to their full satisfaction all the details from the last election, but what matters now is that we preserve the basic freedom in this country, which is the freedom of speech and keep in mind, in that clip, Kari Lake was not referring to something small, something big. She was referring to an election with record numbers of mail in ballots, all with laughably lax security requirements.  

By the way, you may have noticed that just today, Joe Biden or yesterday wanted to vote in his home state of Delaware. Did he vote by mail? Nope. He used hundreds of thousands of dollars in public money to fly Air Force One to Delaware to vote in person. So apparently Joe Biden doesn't trust mail in voting and why would he? And why would any of us be satisfied with the fact the Democratic partisan Mark Zuckerberg was allowed to spend nearly half a billion dollars to control the mechanics of voting in many places? So, why wouldn't Kari Lake have questions about that? Why wouldn't all of us have questions about that, including on us Democrats? Well, we would. Anyone who cares about this country would have questions because asking questions is not a crime. It's a duty.

Ron DeSantis sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Finally, a happy story for once. Outbursts of irrepressible joy erupted throughout the exclusive island community of , last night. For hundreds of years, Martha's Vineyard has suffered from the soul crushing effects of its own Whiteness. Island residents understood there was only one cure. They badly needed diversity. In fact, they often said so, but despite their very best efforts over many years, diversity never came to Martha's Vineyard. It was tragic.  

Imagine an 18th century British frigate adrift on the high seas with no lines, sailors slowly going mad, convulsing, dying, excruciating deaths from scurvy. That was Martha's Vineyard, except it wasn't lime juice they lacked. They had plenty of that because you can't make a gin and tonic without it. What Martha's Vineyard lacked was diversity, which is to say strength. Martha's Vineyard was a very weak place. As of yesterday morning, that island was 89% White, monochromatic and utterly homogenous. Nearly everybody there was a rich Democrat. 80% voted for Joe Biden. The median home price was over $1,000,000. And then in a single blessed moment, everything changed. Relief arrived for an unlikely source.  

Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, having made his own state a paradise, decided to help other states desperately in need. So yesterday, the center sent 50 illegal aliens, most of them from Venezuela, to the Martha's Vineyard Airport. They traveled from San Antonio to the Florida Panhandle and filing to their new home on Martha's Vineyard. CBS Boston reports that after landing, the group wandered about three and a half miles from the airport into town, thereby instantly improving it. You can imagine the unrestrained jubilation on Martha's Vineyard tonight, long-suffering islanders finally rescued from their own oppressive Whiteness. In fact, let's go there now to check in on the celebrations. 

Well, that's not expected. Obviously, there has been a mistake. No, our producers are telling us there are no technical problems. That is, in fact, a live shot from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, right now, but where were the weeping, joyful crowds? Where was the champagne and the ticker tape? We expected Times Square and V-J Day. What we got was a cemetery at midnight. What? But maybe it's not so confusing. Maybe things aren't as they seem. Our first clue is Barack Obama. Barack Obama is a part-time resident of Martha's Vineyard. Obama is also, of course, as you know, the country's greatest proponent of diversity. For years, Obama earnestly told us that immigrants were better than Americans. They were holy. They make our country strong.  

So, that was basically the whole presidency right there for eight years. Obama hectoring us about diversity, but he didn't just talk about it. He spent his two years in office making certain that places like Des Moines, Iowa and Portland, Maine became much less White than they previously had been because, as he so often told us, Whiteness is bad. It's a disease. So, we recall being a little confused when we read that Barack Obama had spent $12 million to buy an eight-bathroom oceanfront property on Martha's Vineyard, which is one of the Whitest places on Earth. Really, Martha's Vineyard? Why not Baltimore or Gary, Indiana? Is there really no real estate left in Detroit for the Obama family compound? There's got to be. What's going on here? We didn't know.

And then in 2019, Michelle Obama explained it to us. Listen to this.  

So, there she was, reminding White folks who badly needed reminding that the Obamas are ""no different from the immigrant families moving in"" because White people hate them, too. They're still running, as she just said. So that explained it to us. The Obamas were, in fact, despised immigrants. So, when they moved to a $12 million seaside compound on Martha's Vineyard, the point is not to live in luxury with other rich people. No, obviously. The point is to diversify Martha's Vineyard, to strike a blow for justice. That makes sense to us and we felt better.

But then last night happened and we started to rethink our assumptions about the Obamas, about a lot of things, because a planeload of highly diverse immigrants arrived on Martha's Vineyard to join the Obamas, but the Obamas didn't welcome them. There was not a word from Barack or Michelle Obama. Barack wasn't waiting at the airport to greet the diversifiers with flowers. He didn't issue a statement of congratulations. He didn't invite a single Venezuelan to his home. How come? 

Could it be that Barack Obama isn't really actually in real life in favor of diversity at all? Could it be that Barack Obama strongly prefers blond SoulCycle moms and Lululemon to sweaty Third World campesinos and dirty work pants? Could it be? We can't say. But we can tell you that if you want to find out what people really think, go ahead and ignore what they say and watch how they live and by that measure, the one that matters, Barack and Michelle Obama are every bit as bigoted as any board member in any restricted country club in the Deep South, assuming those still exist. ""Those people? They're not dating my daughter. I could tell you that."" 

So, the words we learned this week that Barack Obama really is a racist and not in the way you've always assumed. Obama may hate White people. He certainly seems to, but he also demands to live around them and only them. But the Obamas, to be fair, are not alone in this. His friends at the news networks in Washington, New York and Los Angeles feel exactly the same way because they're exactly the same sort of people. CNN, for example, spent the day interviewing people connected in some way to Martha's Vineyard. Turns out that precisely none of them were excited about the planeload of Venezuelans. One of them, the state rep for the island, even blamed this show for the sudden blessed surge in diversity. Watch this.  

Wow. So, see if you can follow the argument here. When penniless illegal aliens show up in Brownsville, Texas, one of the poorest cities in the United States, they are noble strivers. They're looking for a better life in this country, and we applaud them. ""Good luck in Brownsville, newly arrived immigrants,"" but when these very same people jump the moat and get a free flight to Martha's Vineyard, it's something else entirely. It is, as the state rep just told you, ""playing political games with people's lives"" because it's dangerous. These immigrants could wander into a clambake by accident or worse, much worse.  

Earlier today, CNN anchor John Berman (who just got fired, by the way, this morning. This morning!) John Berman interviewed noted filmmaker Ken Burns. Burns is famous, but sad, exactly the kind of middle-aged prestige hound who spends an awful lot of time looming around Martha's Vineyard looking for other famous people. Burns has a new film out that blames the United States, of all countries on Earth, for the Holocaust.  

Now that the World War II generation has passed, Ken Burns can do that. There's no chance angry veterans will show up at his house and beat him with their canes for besmirching the memory of their closest friends who died in the early twenties fighting the Nazis. So, Ken Burns can say whatever he wants, and he will believe him. So, this morning, Burns played the role of Holocaust expert on CNN and you know what Ken Burns has discovered? Ken Burns has discovered that  sending illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard is pretty much exactly what Hitler did, pretty much exactly. Watch this.  

Do you hear that, ladies and gentlemen? It's literally – – just like the Holocaust. Edgartown is Dachau. Oak Bluffs is Treblinka. The horrors! This is genocide and it may be, but of course, everything is relative. Martha's Vineyard may be a modern-day death camp, but compared to where illegal aliens usually go, it doesn't look that bad. Let's compare just for fun. On your screen, you will see images recently shot in America's border towns, which are now completely overrun under Joe Biden's immigration policy. You will know this if you look carefully chaos, violence and filth.  

Now we will take you to Martha's Vineyard. It's hellish, perhaps, but in a very different way—families eating together on balconies overlooking the water, women doing their shopping in a quaint little town on bicycles, couples strolling along the boardwalk, sailboats. It doesn't look that bad. Oh, but that's exactly the problem the media told us today. Martha's Vineyard may seem like one of the richest places on the planet, but somehow –  – there aren't enough social services there. It's bereft of social services, unlike Brownsville.  

CBS News put it ""Martha's Vineyard is not an urban metropolitan area with a robust social services infrastructure. There's no Justice Department immigration court where the migrants can attend asylum hearings. There's no ICE field office for migrants can check in"" now, but you see, Martha's Vineyard is in ""an urban area"" with a ""robust social services infrastructure"" that other people get to deal with and honestly, that's true and it's kind of the whole idea. 

That's why DeSantis sent the illegal aliens to Martha's Vineyard. People who make and advocate for certain policies should at some point have to live with those policies, but until now, they haven't had to. Bill Gates goes to Martha's Vineyard. So does Oprah, James Taylor, Spike Lee, Amy Schumer, and many more and all of them. Every one is a much better person than you are because they support diversity and now for the first time, they're going to have some diversity.

But it's just the beginning. Martha's Vineyard will need many, many more illegal aliens, tens of housands more, until the island is no longer majority White. Only then can it be a good place. Yet, at the same time, the people who currently go to Martha's Vineyard are going to have to keep going there. They can't run away to somewhere else. That would be immoral. It would be, as Michelle Obama has told us, ""White flight."" Now massive demographic change will obviously make Martha's Vineyard a very different sort of place, but that's okay. Change is good. Anyone who fears change is racist. We know that for sure because they told us that for years.

""Where,"" you may ask, ""will all these new people live on such a small island?"" Simple. First, they can occupy Barack Obama's compound. There is no reason Obama needs that much space. Nobody needs that much space. You could probably fit a dozen immigrant families in Barack Obama's pool house and another five or six in the pantry. Keep going. Build a soccer field on the lawn, an outdoor goat barbecue by the back door and bingo, you've got affordable housing, but it won't be enough.  

The vineyard is going to need to construct shantytowns for all these new people, but we can't call them shantytowns. Obviously, that's demeaning. So, we're going to call them townships after Obama's favorite country and they're going to give them dignified names that suggest some kind of victory over adversity: Mandela, Cesar Chavezville, Kamala-apolis. 

Now, inside each one we will put a plaque with that famous Emma Lazarus poem, just so that everybody knows that these are not ordinary favelas. These are moral victories. As the signs say in Martha's Vineyard to this day, ""No human is illegal. Love is love."" That's just science.

But speaking of science, what will the environmental impact of all this new development be? That's a massive concern of Martha's Vineyard and for good reason, but in this case, it's not a concern. None of these new townships will have running water or electricity. So, by definition, they will be carbon-neutral. It'll be part of the Green Revolution.  

Local law enforcement services won't be strained either because they won't be needed. None of these new arrivals will be bound by local laws. Why would they be? They ignored federal law to get here. There's no reason that they should have to observe the vineyard's ordinances against, say, drunk driving or defecating in public and just in case, there are still vineyarders who think they have the right to protect what they own, think again, people. We refer you to the case of the fascist McCloskey family in St. Louis who once tried that, tried to defend what's theirs, and they got indicted for it, so that's not allowed. But we can't fully trust you. Somebody's going to have to go door to door to make sure that not one person on Martha's Vineyard keeps a gun at home because self-defense can be tempting even for Democratic voters. 

There's a lot of change for the Vineyard and they're going to start work soon. The summer season begins on Memorial Day. So, when Amy Schumer shows up to her place in June, she better be ready to find an illegal alien family using her bath towels. Yes, she will and let's hope she doesn't complain about it, because as Joe Biden often reminds us, illegal immigration is a gift.  

Hear that? Hear that? Illegal immigration is not a burden. It's a gift, dumbo. So, Martha's Vineyard received an enormous gift last night. Think of it like a perpetual Christmas, but noisier. And you can't beat the timing. As Karine Jean-Pierre just reminded us today at the White House, it's Hispanic Heritage Month. Perfect, so roll with it, Martha's Vineyard. Things are about to change a lot for you, but that's OK.

Radical, destructive change is the essence of anti-racism, and as you've told us so many times, you support anti-racism, lest we need to remind you and, in any case, pretty soon you'll have no memory of the way things were before. Martha's Vineyard will feel and look just like El Paso and that will all seem normal to you. ""What's El Paso like?"" you wonder. Haven't been there lately? OK. Well, here's some recent pictures.  

Oh, wow. Look, El Paso has Venezuelans, too, and that's why tonight it's redolent of diversity, brimming with the gift of illegal immigration. That'll be Edgartown, Massachusetts soon but we can't stop there. Why would we? If we're really going to make Martha's Vineyard look like the world, the people who vacation on Martha's Vineyard have created for the rest of us, we're going to need to import graffiti artists, armed robbers and subway rapists and the drug addicted homeless community, many, many of those and their tents.  

Why should they be living outside your house when they could be camped on Barack Obama's $12 million lawn? That seems fair. Why isn't it fair? Well, unfortunately, don't expect Obama to see it the same way. He is a racist as we've established, and so apparently are his fellow liberals. They are outraged by the idea of illegal aliens near their island vacation homes. Before long, they'll be tweeting in solidarity with the Vineyard's White community. ""Hashtag, I stand with Martha's Vineyard."" Little Island emojis in their bios. Hilarious. That could actually happen, by the way, because in the end, liberals really do stand with Martha's Vineyard against everyone else and honestly, on some level, we can kind of understand why.  

If we're being honest, we don't want to see Martha's Vineyard trashed. We're Americans and Martha's Vineyard is a beautiful place. It's a sin to destroy beautiful things always. Unfortunately, and this really is the point, Martha's Vineyard is one of a dwindling number of beautiful places left in our country. Martha's Vineyard is what most of America once was not all that long ago—small, socially cohesive, orderly, safe with traditional human-centered architecture and big stretches of nature, unspoiled by industrial wind farms and dollar stores. 

The people who live in Martha's Vineyard now didn't build any of that. The people who did build it are long gone, along with the attitudes and values that made it possible. The people who live there now just came for the nostalgia and all that's left really are the buildings and the beaches, but still you'd hate to see them wrecked. 

On the other hand, at this point, we may have no choice. No sane country would allow millions of foreign nationals to walk across its borders illegally and then immediately give them government benefits in exchange for mocking our rule of law. No one would ever do that. It is suicide. Over time, it will destroy the United States. Everyone can see that, no matter what they say, but the people who vacation on Martha's Vineyard don't care. They are making this possible. They support it. They vote for it. They fund it, and they can do all of that because they are so insulated from the effects of Joe Biden's lunatic immigration policies that none of it matters to them. The country collapses? Big deal. They live on an island. but to the rest of us, it is a big deal. This is our country. We were born here. We planned to die here. We have nowhere else to go, and we don't want to live in a slum. Maybe  will finally understand.

Ron DeSantis sent migrants to Martha's Vineyard on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Martha's Vineyard is an idyllic spot in the Atlantic Ocean off Massachusetts, but for decades now, people in  have been pining for diversity. Well, diversity finally arrived, sent on a jet plane by Ron DeSantis and the second diversity arrived, the locals, the ones who pined for diversity, called the army and had diversity shipped to a military base where apparently diversity belongs. People were not too upset at Martha's Vineyard as diversity was led away to a military base. Watch. 

Those are cheers in Martha's Vineyard this morning, just before migrants boarded buses to go on to joint base Cape Cod.""

 So, it may seem like they're bigots. I mean, what's the other conclusion? But no, according to CNN, they're just grateful. They were clapping in gratitude for Ron DeSantis and what he did, the gift that he gave them. Here's an . 

We didn't believe this was real, but it is and we're quoting:""'They enriched us’: Migrants' 44-hour visit leaves indelible mark on Martha's Vineyard."" 44 hours! Wow, that didn't take long to leave an indelible mark. Less than two days in the same zip code with Venezuelans and their lives are changed forever. Does this remind you of the kid in your class who adopted a Spanish accent after a spring break in Cabo or the guy who converted to Islam because he once switched planes in Dubai? It seems a little premature, right?  

So, we decided to look into it. Is  really congratulating itself for surviving its ever so brief encounter with Hispanics? Yes, it is. One nonprofit on the island called the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation posted this message on its website. Again, this is real: 

""Our immigrant visitors have left the island. They have expressed enormous gratitude for the outpouring of support and generosity shown by the island community, which was heartfelt and overflowing."" 

These people called the Army in to have the Hispanics shipped to a military base, but the Hispanics are very grateful to be shipped to a military base by the Army. They're grateful for the attention. The foundation also praised island residents for raising $40,000 in a fundraiser for the migrants. Oh, but not really for the migrants, because none of the money is going to actual migrants. Of course, it's not. 

""The Vineyard community stepped up in an unprecedented way."" Really? On whose behalf? Oh, its own. The money went to them. They raised money for themselves, not for the Venezuelans. Hilarious!

But if you want to know, in any community across the United States where the locust of self-congratulatory posturing is, where the most insufferable people in any given town that, of course, would be the local Episcopal Church and in Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard that is St Andrew's Episcopal and needless to say, as their inclination, they self-congratulated big-time. 

""We have been so overwhelmed with everyone's kind words and thought and financial support for our brothers and sisters from Venezuela.""  So, we thought we'd check in with our brothers and sisters in Venezuela, but unfortunately, they're locked up on a military base, so they could not be reached for comment tonight.

731	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-shreds-biden-border-crisis-all-fault	2022-09-20 22:19:00	Tucker Carlson shreds Biden over the border crisis: 'It's all his fault' | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson voices his concerns over the crisis at the southern border as Pakistanis are paying to cross illegally on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We'll admit it up front. We can't get off this Martha's Vineyard story because there's just so much there. So last week, you'll recall, our Venezuelan visitors to this country, our brothers and sisters as they're now known on CNN, took what amounted to the shortest vacation ever recorded to Martha's Vineyard. They were on that island for just hours, less than two full days. It was hardly enough time to pick up a Fair Trade coffee at Mocha Mott's in Vineyard Haven or go kiteboarding on South Beach.  

In fact, we have literally been talking about their trip longer than it lasted. It was that brief. On the other hand, so was the moon landing, so was the Wright Brothers first flight at Kitty Hawk. Duration is no measure of effect. Those brief hours our Venezuelan brothers and sisters spent on Martha's Vineyard changed history and left what they're calling an ""indelible mark"" on the people who live there. ""They enriched us,"" said one resident. ""We were happy to help them on their journey."" 

Unfortunately, as it turned out, that journey ended abruptly at a military base on Cape Cod, where our Venezuelan brothers and sisters are now being held against their will, prisoners in a country they thought was their own. There are no Mocha Motts where they are now. Kiteboarding is completely out of the question. It's just a bitter dream at this point. Now, the people of Martha's Vineyard knew this was going to happen and yet none of them thought to tell their Venezuelan brothers and sisters before it happened. 

""I kept telling them it was like a dormitory,"" said Jackie Stallings, who lives on the island as soldiers arrived to deport her Venezuelan siblings. ""I didn't want to say, 'You're going to a military base.'"" 

Well, of course not. It's a dormitory, just like your dad sent your elderly dog to a farm because he'll be happier there. But the Venezuelans are not happier in military lockup. They loved Martha's Vineyard. As they told MSNBC, they considered it a paradise.  

So finally, one reporter over at NBC News tells the truth about what is actually a pretty sad story. Our Venezuelan brothers and sisters came to this country for a better life and unlike so many, they actually found it. They arrived in one of the prettiest and most affluent destinations on the planet, an idyllic island with unlimited resources, many thousands of empty beds and, best of all, a population that claimed to love them. ""No person is illegal,"" read the lawn signs. But it was all a lie. 50 Brown people was too many for the people of Martha's Vineyard. They called in the army to have them removed like trash, as one island resident said. 

So, actually, judging by the behavior and not simply by their lawn signs, which is the best way to judge people, the people of Martha's Vineyard are not especially compassionate. In fact, they're small-minded and cheap and pretty nasty as any waiter or babysitter who works on the island can tell you. So, once again, the ones you claim to be the best people are actually the worst people. Remember when Jimmy Swaggart got busted with hookers and porn? It's very much like that. The truth turns out to be the opposite of what they told you it was. It's highly embarrassing, but here's the weird thing, on Martha's Vineyard they're not embarrassed at all.  

Jimmy Swaggart famously apologized for his sins because he had shame, but the people of Martha's Vineyard have no shame and so they're not apologizing. In fact, against all evidence, they're now bragging about how wonderful they are. Yesterday, Kerry Picket of The Washington Times caught up with Martha's Vineyard's senior senator. That would be Mrs. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Listen to Elizabeth Warren's version of the Martha's Vineyard story.  

Well, if nothing else, it's interesting to see history, history that we've watched unfold, a story in which the facts are not at all in dispute, get rewritten in real time and you wonder how many other stories have been rewritten, but we can see this one being rewritten. In Elizabeth Warren's telling, actually the people of Martha's Vineyard are the heroes and  is the villain because he deceived them. 

Now, we just heard — and it's again factually not at dispute — that island residents deceived their Venezuelan siblings by telling them they were just going to a dorm. They're not being locked up on a military base like terrorists. So actually, the people of Martha's Vineyard, the residents there, are the ones who did the tricking. They tricked the Venezuelans into going to a military base, but that wasn't deception. 

No, according to Elizabeth Warren, it was an act of love, but at some point, whatever, the people of Martha's Vineyard got what they wanted. Everything is back to normal there. The people who live there are relieved. They're not going to be 50 needing minorities in their midst to spoil the usual festivities and that would include the Food and Wine Festival.  

So, just so you know, you taste the wine and then eat the oyster and then you taste the wine again in the way they mesh in your mouth. Those flavors, the complexity of them, it's like an explosion on your palate and that's why thousands of people come to Martha's Vineyard every year for that festival. But guess who doesn't come? Venezuelans, unless they're serving the oysters and pouring the wine. So really, we could go on at great length about this because it's just such a great story and reveal so much, but it's much bigger than the now established fact that Martha's Vineyard is populated by nasty liberals who don't tip and don't actually want colored people in their midst. That's true. We know that now.

But the bigger story and the one that affects the rest of us, the other 340 million people who live here, is that what we saw in Martha's Vineyard is, in fact, just a taste of what is absolutely the official policy of the Democratic Party and it is this: If your town votes the right way, then you get military protection. The military shows up immediately. 50 people not hurting anybody and the army comes to remove them. Can you imagine? Talk about a 911 call. That's pretty great. All you need to do is vote 80% for Joe Biden and you can do that and throw some donations this way too. But what about everybody else? Well, everyone else is SOL, and that would include all of us.  

Over the past 11 months, American authorities have encountered more than 2 million illegals along the southern border, the highest number ever recorded by the U.S. government. At least another 1 million were allowed into this country as so-called economic migrants, meaning they want better jobs because who doesn't want a better job? Hundreds of thousands more. We don't know the number, but clearly hundreds of thousands just sneaked in.  

That's according to the official data. Now, how many of those are headed to military bases for deportation and how many cases to the U.S. military arrive to solve what is so clearly a disaster? Zero, because it wasn't Martha's Vineyard. Now, we've been making a documentary on this, a documentary on the  called ""Battle for the Borders"" coming out later this year and in the course of reporting it out, we obtained this footage showing how some of these illegal aliens entered this country. These pictures were shot on July 23 this year.  

So, when people on Martha's Vineyard think of illegal immigration, they really think groundskeepers and waiters and people who work at the back end of the kitchen, people who clean up or prepare the food. That's what illegal immigration is to them. They're not really thinking, none of us are really thinking, that people might be showing up from Pakistan. Really? Pakistan?  They didn't walk. 

By the way, isn't Pakistan the place where ISIS has just called for jihadis to enter the United States and kill Americans? Why are these guys walking on a road in Texas? Now, during their interview with the police, both of the men you just saw admitted they were here illegally. They said they each paid thousands of dollars to be smuggled into the United States. This is very common now. It's not the immigration you remember. Who are these people? Do they mean us harm? It's not simply a matter of competing for jobs with American citizens. It's potentially a grave threat, and a lot of people like this are coming across the border right now. Here's Fox's Bill Melugin:

So, we're just getting word right now that the White House, many White House officials are telling ""journalists"" that they are very annoyed by Bill Milligan's reporting. It's ""alarmist."" In other words, unlike reporters of The Washington Post and The New York Times, Bill Melugin doesn't think that he works for Joe Biden. He's taking pictures of what's actually happening and that's wrong.  

What's interesting, given what is happening, which is that we are being invaded by people who have no right to be here for reasons that we don't really understand, is that none of the people who are complaining about Ron DeSantis sending 50 Venezuelans to Martha's Vineyard have said a word about what else is happening on the border and a lot is happening. It's an ongoing humanitarian disaster, a tragedy for the people being trafficked and they are being trafficked, but it's also an ongoing disaster for us who live here. It's our country. As Melugin reported, human traffickers are loading more than a dozen people into the backs of cars right now, which is a disaster. Watch this.  

So, it's a human wave and that's not an attack on the people coming over here. They are being rewarded by the Biden administration in exchange for breaking our laws, for mocking our Constitution. They're being rewarded with public benefits. So, why wouldn't they come? But the volume of this is without precedent in American history, and you have to ask yourself, what does this mean for the country? It's obviously destabilizing, but what does it mean long-term for the country?  

Well, just to give you some perspective on the numbers here. As Neil Monroe at Breitbart has reported, in a given year, roughly three migrants arriving for every four Americans who were born in this country. Three migrants for every four Americans born. Oh. Remember, the great replacement theory was a conspiracy theory? It sounds more like a statistical fact. Actually, was there a vote on this? Did we get to vote on this? Do people want this? Democracy, remember that? That's where people vote and get to decide what kind of government they get and what sort of policies the government enacts. No, no. No one voted on this. Nobody wants this. It's happening anyway against the will of the entire country. So, what did Biden say about this? Well, here's what he said today: 

Well, that's just completely insane, of course. They're coming through Mexico and we control the Mexican economy. We could turn off the Mexican economy in one minute if we wanted to. Of course, we're by far their biggest trading partner, and so we have an enormous amount of leverage over the Mexican government and if we said to the Mexican government, ""not one more crosses through your country into ours,"" that'd be the end of it, because no one wants to tango with the Federales.  

No one takes American law enforcement seriously because they know they're just going to direct you to the local welfare office. Nobody messes with the Mexican Federales, period, and everyone knows that. But we're not doing that. What Biden said that is true is that as of this fiscal year, migrants from places other than the Northern Triangle countries in Mexico, specifically Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela do make up nearly 40% of the total apprehensions at the border as of last month. That's a 175% jump from last year.  

What Biden didn't say, of course, is that it's all his fault. He's solely responsible for this. He stopped deporting asylum seekers. He's allowing asylum seekers with fraudulent claims to remain in this country and of course, the message has gone out to the world. Just show up and you'll be fine. 

So, let's say you wanted to harm the United States. What would you do? Well, what did Fidel Castro do in 1980 with the Muriel boat lift? He opened his prisons and mental hospitals and sent them to Miami, thereby changing Miami forever.  

Venezuela is doing something very similar. Venezuela's opening its prisons and sending them here. Breitbart reports tonight that DHS is warning border officials to be on the lookout for Venezuelan convicts entering the country. DHS indicates that ""the Venezuelan government is purposely freeing inmates, including some convicted of murder, rape and extortion."" It's unbelievable.  

Again, we've seen this before, and it's a catastrophe again. During the Carter administration, Fidel Castro's government, the Cuban government, did the very same thing. 125,000 people came to Florida. A Sun-Sentinel article from 1985 estimated that out of the 125,000 migrants who came at the time, 16,000 to 20,000 were criminals. The Miami district director for immigration called it an invasion.  

""The boatlift should never been allowed to happen. At any other time it would have been an act of war"" and Bill Clinton, who was governor of Arkansas at the time, said exactly the same thing, but a lot has changed since 1985. No one in the federal government will admit what this is, which is an invasion and of course, the media are totally for it because, . So, law enforcement authorities, rather than doing anything with the people invading our country, are talking about prosecuting Ron DeSantis. 

That's appalling and shocking. For any law enforcement official, a guy who carries a gun and has a right to shoot you, to be parroting Biden administration political talking points in front of a camera – that man should be ashamed. That is completely over-the-top that he would say something like this. This is all crazy. We're being invaded and now they're talking about prosecuting Ron DeSantis because he sent 50 people to Martha's Vineyard who were immediately deported so they wouldn't get in the way of the Food and Wine Festival. True craziness!

If you're used to thinking of  as our slightly dorky Arctic cousin, literally the last nation on earth where the mullet is considered a legitimate haircut, the country where American fads go to die and of course you are used to thinking all of that about Canada because it's long been true, it's time to think again.  

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Canada, of all places, is a leading indicator. As the woke revolution spreads across the West, Canada is at the vanguard of it. Under Justin Trudeau, Canada has done everything to the maximum possible extent. It has criminalized political speech. It has banned self-defense. It's used the power of the state to squelch Christianity, all of it. So, if you want to know what's going to happen next in the United States, it's time to look north. Canada is the ghost of our Christmas future. 

So, with that in mind, it's worth taking a look at what is happening right now in Canada's schools, because you are certain to see all of it in your  very soon. This week, video surfaced on the Internet from a place called Trafalgar High School in Oakville, Ontario. That's right across the lake from Niagara Falls. These videos show a teacher called Stephen Hanna, who apparently has been employed at Trafalgar High for several years. Recently, Hanna decided to dress like a woman or more precisely, as a grotesque caricature of a woman, not a real woman, but a kind of new, manically inflated Marilyn Monroe lookalike.  

As part of his costume, Hanna strapped on a pair of gigantic prosthetic breasts, each the size of a 10 pound watermelon. We're not exaggerating here. They're visible from at least 100 yards away, if not from space. We'll show you the picture. We are right now on the screen, but here's the thing. Hanna isn't doing this in private, in his home and restaurants and clubs. If he were, we would not be mentioning on the show because it would not be our business. Have fun, Stephen Hanna. No, Stephen Hanna is doing it in class in front of children.  

As the Canadian journalist Jonathan Kay put it, Hanna ""has been dressing (like this) for a while, but only recently have students within the school gone public with this fact."" So, they've been enduring this for a while. Kay also notes that Hanna's costume is based on the style of Japanese Internet pornography, which translates roughly into English as ""exploding milk porn."" 

So, what's going on here? Well, you know exactly what's going on here. Let's stop pretending. Women may not see it right away because generally their lives are not defined by their sex drives, but if you're a man, you get it instantly. What is this about? It's about sex. Stephen Hanna is enlisting other people's children in his sexual fantasies. That's why he's doing this in class. Having an audience of children gives Stephen Hanna a sexual charge. He's getting off on this. There's no question about it. This is the guy in the van trying to give your sixth grader candy. This is the flasher in the park. This guy is a pervert. He should not be within 500 yards of children. Period. He's a threat to children.  

Now, there have always been threats to children. In every society, there are people like this and every society deals with them swiftly and very harshly, but no longer in the West. Now, people like this are not punished. They are celebrated and then protected. Trafalgar High School, which is public, it's funded by Canadian taxpayers, is vigorously defending his behavior and threatening anyone who notices, so is the Halton District School Board, which oversees the school. 

They just sent us the statement and we're quoting ""The school board recognizes the rights of the parents, staff, students, guardians, community members to equitable treatment without discrimination based upon gender identity and gender expression. Gender identity and gender expression are protected grounds under the Ontario Human Rights Code."" Oh, the Human Rights Code. Really? Where are the rights of the kids? There are none.  

In other words, if you complain, if you're a parent who complains about Stephen Hanna enlisting your children in his sexual fantasies, you are the criminal. You are breaking Canadian law. For the most part, the Canadian media, the most supine media that speaks English, are siding with Stephen Hanna, the sicko. Other than the noble exceptions of Jonathan Kay, who we just quoted, and a small feminist blog called ""Reduxx,"" nobody is covering what Stephen Hanna, is doing to kids sexually.  

The rest are effectively defending it. Toronto Sun, for example, went with this headline: ""School board prepares for backlash over trans high school teacher."" Oh, backlash? Trans high school teacher? He's protected. No, he's a freaking weirdo wagging fake breasts in the face of your children because it titillates him and if you complain about that, you're the problem.  

So, the problem is parents, not the pervert in the classroom. It's hard to believe this is happening, but we're sad to tell you it's not just happening in Canada. You see versions of it everywhere, including in this country and to be clear what this is: children being used as props in the sexual fantasies of adults. Children being used as props in the sexual fantasies of adults! Are you okay with that? Is any normal person okay with that? It's completely wrong. It's utterly outside the bounds of what's acceptable. It's not a close call and yet suddenly teachers, licensed teachers, are bragging about it on social media. 

I have had multiple students come out to be not just with their sexuality, but also with their gender identity. It's one of the reasons I think it's so important to be out and loud and proud.  

I teach my elementary school students about gender identity. Some people are girls, some are boys, some are both, some are neither.  

I tell this kid, ""We do have a flag in the class that you can pledge allegiance to,"" and he looks around, he goes, ""Oh, that one.""  

So again, if you were walking through the park with your kids and a stranger came up and started talking to them, say to your fifth grader, your five-year-old, even your 14-year-old about sex, what would you do?"" Well, you would call the police, of course. That's not allowed. It's a crime because they're children, but teachers are allowed to do it and then to brag about it and it's not stopping with classroom instruction. All over the country, adults are forcing children to attend drag shows. Watch. 

So, just to be clear, as if it's not clear and somehow we're in such a haze that it isn't clear to a lot of people, these are sexual fantasies playing out in public and on one hand, we've also agreed, that's fine, go do your thing, but you are not allowed to bring children into your sexual fantasies because that's a species of child molestation. You can be fully clothed when it happens. It doesn't make it any less abusive or any less immoral. They're children. Keep children away from your sex life, sicko. There was never any question about that, but now there is, and it's a bit of a tip off that the same people conducting it are now trying to tell you that you can't use the word pedophile. I wonder why. Watch this. 

I want to talk about minor-attracted persons because they are probably the most vilified population of folks in our culture. You may have noticed that I'm using the term ""minor-attracted persons,"" sometimes abbreviated to MAPS instead of the more commonly used term ""pedophile."" 

MAP advocacy groups like Before You Act, have advocated for use of the term ""MAP."" They've advocated for it primarily because it's less stigmatizing than other terms like ""pedophile."" A lot of people, when they hear the term ""pedophile,"" they automatically assume that it means a sex offender and that isn't true and it leads to a lot of misconceptions about attractions toward minors.  

That last clip was from the Protasia Foundation, which you think federal law enforcement are taking a very close look at and it's donors. Child molestation is a crime for a reason. It destroys people. You can't use children as sexual objects. Now, the person you heard from, Allyn Walker, worked at Old Dominion University in Virginia. She was fired after the video came out, but shortly after, Johns Hopkins hired her as a postdoc. 

So, she got promoted. She was rewarded for making excuses for child molestation. Hmm and it's not just academics. You see, book publishers are aggressively trying to sexualize children. You take a look at young adult books recently. Most are just stupid. Some are flat out pornographic. In Fairfax, Virginia last year, a mother informed her school board that two books in the school's library, one called ""Gender Queer,"" another called ""Lawn Boy,"" written for seventh graders, contained material that you don't need to be a prude to think, ""Wow, this is not, something is going on here."" 

According to ABC News, the book ""Gender Queer"" ""...contains explicit illustrations of oral sex and masturbation. The novel ‘Lawn Boy’ contains graphic depictions of sex between men and children."" So, why are they pushing this on kids? Well, of course, to prime them for sexual exploitation and anyone who said ""that's a puritanical take on this, you're being hysterical,"" get real. Get real! What's the point of pushing pornography on children except to sexualize them and take advantage of them? And they're telling us it's not really child molestation. By the way, everyone in charge seems to be fully behind this. Oh, it's so dark and then, of course, there's the medical angle. 

At Boston Children's Hospital, they're cutting the breasts off of healthy children. According to a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, Boston's Children's Hospital did, we're quoting 177 ""gender affirming"" double mastectomy surgeries in recent years, roughly half of them run girls 15 to 18. Similar ""gender affirming"" treatments, specifically chemical castration, were offered for many years in Britain, (We're not the first to do this) at their infamous Tavistock ""child identity clinic."" 

Now, Britain's government just announced it is closing Tavistock? Why? Because they've been sued by more than a thousand families who allege that ""children and young adolescents were rushed into treatment"" and therefore ""suffered life changing and in some cases, irreversible effects."" They should have known that. The data have been out for a long time, but people with a sexual agenda (not a political agenda, a sexual agenda) have pushed so hard to make this legal and then fashionable that we've ignored it, but the numbers have been there in 2011. 

Researchers in Sweden released the results of a study that lasted three decades. That study found that people who underwent ""gender affirming surgery"" were 19 times more likely to kill themselves than people who hadn't, the general population. So, instead of covering all this (, really? Sexualizing children, mutilating their genitals because you get off on it) our media is not covering this at all. They're encouraging it and they're hiding the reality behind euphemisms. You're referring to castration as ""gender affirming care,"" castration of children. 

Gender affirming mental and medical care for minors.  

Often provide gender affirming care to  people.  

and gender, gender affirming care.  

Seeking to ban gender affirming medical care for transgender youth. 

Efforts to restrict access to gender affirming care.  

lifesaving, gender affirming care for transgender people.  

. Really? Can you slow down a little bit and tell me what exactly that entails? Can you be a lot more specific? Can you bring pictures in? Show me what it looks like. Can you do that? What exactly are teachers talking to my kids about? What's a human sexuality lecture look like in my sixth graders class? Why don't you tell me?  

Speak slowly so I can take notes. The reality of all this behind the euphemism is horrifying. It's sexualizing children and they go completely hysterical when you point that out, because it's true and the real question is, why is anyone else putting up with this? In a healthy country with an intact social fabric, neighborhood dads would mete out instant justice to anyone who even thought about sexualizing their kids and if you doubt that, go ahead and try it in Bulgaria or South Africa or the Solomon Islands. Good luck. Let us know how that ends, if you can still speak. People won't put up with it because the instinct to protect your children is the deepest of all human instincts and it has to be. Of course, it has to be, but it's been all but eliminated in the West.  

Parents in this country and in Canada are far more passive. Why? Because they haven't recognized this phenomenon for what it is. They believe it's some kind of political movement somehow related to the liberation struggle for trans rights and therefore something you're not allowed to complain about or you're a bigot and all the moms think you're bad, but it's not a liberation struggle. There is no liberation struggle. 

The battle for trans rights is long over. Trans people have rights. They can trust any way they like and not only is that entirely legal, most Americans have no interest whatsoever in interfering with it at all. This is a fundamentally live and let live country, and it always has been. That's the deal we've always had. and the overwhelming majority of the American population still favors that. Republican, Democrat, everybody's for that, but that's not what this is at all. These are not people who want to leave you alone or your kids alone. These are weirdos getting creepy with other people's children. That's exactly what it is said. Say it. That's what it is. Now, naturally, Joe Biden, who showered with his own daughter who said her sex life was destroyed by it, is now the lead spokesman for this lunacy. 

Oh, yeah. Tell us more about how to keep your children safe and healthy, Joe Biden, Mr. Shower-with-his-daughter-guy. Are you joking? These are sex crimes and the people committing them should be punished. Now try and say that out loud anywhere but on Fox News. You can't. Why can't you? Because it's true. That's why. You can't see the true things. You can claim the earth is flat and no one gets exercise, but when you start saying things like ""all lives matter"" or ""sexualizing my children is a crime and if you keep it up, I'm going to hurt you because I'm the dad,"" say that, Oh, you're done. Libs of TikTok is being banned from the Internet. Why? Because it showed documentary evidence of what was happening. Some people describe what was happening as grooming. We're not exactly sure what that means, but if it's sexually abusing children, yeah, that is what's happening, but the term ""groomer"" is now hate speech, says NBC News.  

Yeah. They're being mean to doctors who castrate children and cut the breasts off girls. Yeah. This is not only happening. It is being celebrated and aggressively defended by virtually everyone with power. Take three steps back. We used to say, ""Oh, our society doesn't care about children."" That's not what this is. What you're seeing is a society that hates children. You would have to hate children in order to sexualize them because sexualizing children screws them up for life. Ask anyone to whom it's happened, period. No one should put up with it. 

No parent should put up with this for one second, no matter what the law says. Your duty, your moral duty is to defend your children. This is an attack on your children and you should fight back.

733	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-hospitals-mutilating-children-look-back-shame-horror	2022-09-21 22:57:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Hospitals are mutilating children, and one day we'll look back in shame, horror | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson shreds hospitals for performing surgeries on transgender children on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

For thousands of years, clinical trials have been the center of medicine and the idea is very simple. Before you operate on someone or inject people with some new drug, you run trials first to make certain that what you're doing will help the patient more than it hurts the patient. This is not a new idea. 

James Lind did it back in the 18th century with his famous scurvy trials. In fact, medical testing has been going on since at least biblical times because why wouldn't it? Daniel of Judah compared a vegetarian diet with the diet of the royal Babylonians over a 10-day period, so he had a control group, independent observers, the whole thing. It's not complicated, but it is essential. Throughout history, very few have questioned this practice because it makes obvious sense, but now they are.  

Modern medicine seems to be abandoning the clinical trial. The FDA, for example, just authorized a COVID booster without even bothering to test it on people. They just gave it to a handful of mice and said we're ready to go. Why take the time to see if it actually works? Who cares if the drug lowers sperm counts or causes miscarriages or produces grotesque blood clots in otherwise healthy people? 

The pharmaceutical companies can't be sued, so they're safe. They no longer have to care even about oversight. They sponsor the media companies that cover them. Big tech censors anyone who asks questions about what they do. Payment providers swoop in to shut down the businesses of anyone who dares to criticize Pfizer. That's happening. 

The net effect is sad. Never has American medicine been more transparently a racket than it is right now. With the most basic ethical guidelines gone, completely ignored, you should not be surprised to learn that some hospitals have decided to monetize the mental anguish of children. Consider the University of California at San Francisco Hospital. Supposedly, it's one of the best in the world. UCSF, despite its august reputation, is not even trying to behave responsibly with children who been convinced by TikTok they should change their sex. 

A new trend comes along propelled by social media. It didn't exist before at scale. Now it does. Rather than pausing and asking,What is this and how can we help the children? They blow right past it. UCSF Hospital's current guidance for treating so-called  is this. We got this right from their website, ""As youth are transitioning at increasingly younger ages, genital surgery is being performed on a case-by-case basis more frequently in minors."" 

Genital surgery on children – his is a very big step. It's irreversible. So, you wonder, what is the medical basis for this? Well, a few sentences later, UCSF hospital admits that there is no medical basis. Instead, ""In the absence of solid evidence, providers often must rely on the expert opinions of innovators and thought leaders in the field."" 

So, UCSF is conducting genital surgeries on minors based on ""thought leaders in the field."" What does that mean? Well, it means the Human Rights Campaign is in favor of it. It means activists are pushing it. It means there's no scientific data to justify it. This is horrifying. Why is this happening and how widespread is it? No one seems to be interested. Virtually alone in our media, Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire decided to find out the answers to those questions and in that search, he obtained this video. It's from 2018. The video shows a physician called Shayne Taylor from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which, like UCSF, has a global reputation for excellence. In this video, Taylor explains that  on children. Why? Because those surgeries make Vanderbilt money.  

Oh, it makes money. So, this huge new trend appears, again, driven not by medical research, but by social media, convincing children they can change their sex and Vanderbilt, rather than pausing and asking once again, ""How do we help these children? What is this?"" Decides, oh, there's money there. We're all in Now, it's hard to believe that everyone at Vanderbilt Hospital could possibly be for this because it's completely irresponsible and wrong. So, what would happen if a physician at Vanderbilt, a conscientious objector, disagreed with mutilating children for profit? That's a key question.

Another doctor called Ellen Clayton explained what would happen. Again, this video we're about to show you has also been around since 2018, but no one in the media cared to look at it until Matt Walsh found it this week.  

So, if you object to this, leave; you can't work at Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt clearly thought this through. Not everyone's going to be for this, so let's just make it really, really clear. If you're not fully on board with sexually mutilating children for non-medical reasons, on the basis of no medical evidence, then you just leave. 

But that wasn't enough. They anticipated that this is so horrifying that some doctors might still step out of line. They might tell 16-year-olds that they have a psychological disorder or ""this will pass or maybe stop watching so much TikTok"" and ""no, we're not going to mutilate your genitals or cut your breasts off, at least until you're an adult,"" but if they said that, that would of course, hurt the business model, so Vanderbilt recruited activists, trans activists, to bully physicians into submission.  

Oh, trans buddies – right. Enforcers, in other words. It's like having the Mafia standing over your shoulder while you're on the witness stand. Doctors should be, in fact have to be, allowed to give politically unbiased counsel to their patients without being intimidated, but the whole point of a trans buddy system is to prevent that. In one video from Vanderbilt, the trans buddies say they're on the lookout for doctors who don't use the right pronouns because that's ""unsafe."" Get in line or we’ll crush you.  

Matt Walsh brought all of this to the surface just the other day and in response to it, rather than defend it or explain it, Vanderbilt University Medical Center took its entire website offline and no doubt at some point they'll be claiming it's unsafe for them, that the people who are shocked by what they're doing are actually the criminals here and that they're getting threatening phone calls. They're going to call the DOJ and anyone who comments on it is going to get a visit from the FBI. But the truth is, people who are horrified by this are not the bad actors. Vanderbilt is the bad actor. Vanderbilt has just admitted on camera to castrating children as young as 13-years-old. This is from Vanderbilt's psychiatry's YouTube page from 2020:

Has anyone at Vanderbilt Medical Center ever had a 14-year-old? And what sort of person would give a 14-year-old—Do you know what they're like? Have you lived with one before? Would chemically castrate a 14-year-old because he or she saw something on TikTok that suggested it's a good idea. This is lunacy, but the same YouTube page also confirms that Vanderbilt will happily perform double mastectomies on adolescent girls after they've drugged them because, you know, it's pretty lucrative, actually. Here's plastic surgeon Julian Winocour and Physician’s Assistant Shalyn Vanderbloemen:  

So again, this is a hospital filled with physicians and ethicists and other adults who ought to be stepping in to protect children from their worst impulses, from the latest fad, from their parents' neuroses, but they're not doing that because it's just too profitable to destroy the lives of kids. So, who should be the backstop against this? Who are the people who oversee this who really should be exercising adult wisdom here and restraint? Well, that would be, by definition, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center's board of directors, and we're going to name them now in the hope that these people will do something to stop these crimes before the lives of more children are destroyed.  

The board members would include: Edith Carell Johnson; John F. Stein; Jeffrey R. Balser; Lucinda M. Baier; Daniel Diermeier; Sara J. Finley; John R. Ingram; Michael M. E. Johns; Samuel E. Lynch; Alexander C. Taylor; and Makeba Williams. 

Let's hope these people—this is the board that oversees all of this —let's hope these people act immediately to stop this crime. But to be clear, it's not just Vanderbilt. We called UCLA Hospital today and they told us they'd be happy to mutilate our child. They just need a referral for insurance purposes, so did Weill Cornell Medicine. One of our producers, Sammy, called Cornell about getting breast implants for her 15-year-old son, who she said was ""questioning his gender identity"" – just questioning. Here's what they said in response:

   

Breast implants for a 15-year-old boy? Yeah, I'd come with them, whatever. It's not just UCLA. The account Libs of TikTok, which The Washington Post is desperately trying to get scrubbed from the internet, recently recorded a similar call with Children's National Hospital. Listen. 

  

So, Children's National Hospital is now playing the victim here. Anyone who criticizes this as a threat and a danger and get DOJ involved. The Washington Post, New York Times jump on anyone who questions this is evil, but that, of course, is the opposite of the truth. The people doing this know that what they are doing is evil. They know perfectly well and that's why Vanderbilt took down its website after Matt Walsh reported on it. There is no scientific basis for any of this. It does not help children. It harms children. That is known. It's also obvious. Were you not a parent? Researchers in Stockholm  studied the effects of  over a period of 30 years. What did they find? Well, we'll tell you again. 

""Persons with transsexualism after sex reassignment have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population."" 30-year study and it's not just one study. More than a thousand patients at the Tavistock  Gender Clinic in the U.K. have just sued the clinic. They say they were pressured into life destroying treatments and that clinic is now being shut down. And that will happen in this country.  

This is a fad and because there are no adults left, no one has put up a hand to say ""slow down."" But five years from now, we're going to look back on this, like a lot of things we've done recently, like destroying public art and statues and the COVID vaccine and so many other things that we've done without thinking about it, in an environment where no one's allowed to protest, we're going to look back in shame and horror.  

Amy Tishelman  is the lead author of the guidelines for the ""World Professional Association for Transgender Health"" and Tishelman just admitted that recommendations for gender-affirming hormones and surgeries were removed from the internet to eliminate a paper trail and avoid lawsuits when inevitably practitioners followed them. Watch. 

This is completely wrong. They won't even defend it. They won't even answer simple questions about what it is and again, it's irreversible. Hospitals are mutilating children: Boston Children's Hospital, UCSF, Cornell, UCLA, Vanderbilt and other. And they should all stop immediately, no matter how much it hurts their business model, no matter how much it costs them.

734	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-threats-children-no-longer-punished-celebrated-protected	2022-09-22 00:17:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Threats to children are no longer punished, but celebrated and then protected | Fox News	"Fox News' Tucker Carlson shines light on a teacher in Canada who started wearing giant prosthetic breasts modeled after pornographic content in class and how he's allegedly being protected.

Last night we told you about a teacher at  Oakville Trafalgar High School in Ontario Canada. The teacher has recently started wearing giant prosthetic breasts in the classroom in front of children, as a fetish. The teacher's costume is intended to emulate a genre of Japanese pornography that translates roughly to ""exploding milk porn.""

For several days, a number of media organizations  — including a Canadian media outlet that visited the school — reported the teacher’s identity as Stephen Hanna. Oakville Trafalgar High School made no attempt to correct those reports. They wanted to protect the fetishist and child abuser in their school.  

But after our segment, the Halton District School Board in Ontario emailed us to say that, contrary to these multiple reports, which we cited, the teacher in question is not named Stephen Hanna. At the same time, the school Board refused to tell us who the teacher is. The school said, ""We cannot confirm the identity of the individual in the photos/videos/radio segments.""

Why not? It’s a man abusing children in the classroom. He doesn’t deserve protection.  

But the school board, along with Oakville Trafalgar High School, has decided to protect child abusers. In fact, Oakville Trafalgar High School has institutionalized child abuse. The school's policies state that ""dress codes must prevent students from wearing clothing that exposes or makes visible genitals and nipples."" But that policy explicitly doesn't apply to teachers, who are free to expose their nipples and genitals to students at will. And that's exactly what they're doing.

If you're used to thinking of Canada as our slightly dorky Arctic cousin, literally the last nation on Earth where the mullet is considered a legitimate haircut, the country where American fads go to die and of course you are used to thinking all of that about Canada because it's long been true, it's time to think again.  

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Canada, of all places, is a leading indicator. As the woke revolution spreads across the West, Canada is at the vanguard of it.  has done everything to the maximum possible extent. It has criminalized political speech. It has banned self-defense. It's used the power of the state to squelch Christianity, all of it. So, if you want to know what's going to happen next in the United States, it's time to look north. Canada is the ghost of our Christmas future.

So, with that in mind, it's worth taking a look at what is happening right now in Canada's schools, because you are certain to see all of it in your children's schools very soon. This week, video surfaced on the internet from a place called Trafalgar High School in Oakville, Ontario. That's right across the lake from Niagara Falls. These videos show a teacher called Stephen Hanna, who apparently has been employed at Trafalgar High for several years. Recently, Hanna decided to dress like a woman or more precisely, as a grotesque caricature of a woman, not a real woman, but a kind of new, manically inflated Marilyn Monroe lookalike.  

As part of his costume, Hanna strapped on a pair of gigantic prosthetic breasts, each the size of a 10 pound watermelon. We're not exaggerating here. They're visible from at least 100 yards away, if not from space. We'll show you the picture. We are right now on the screen, but here's the thing. Hanna isn't doing this in private, in his home and restaurants and clubs. If he were, we would not be mentioning on the show because it would not be our business. Have fun, Stephen Hanna. No, Stephen Hanna is doing it in class in front of children.  

As the Canadian journalist Jonathan Kay put it, the teacher ""has been dressing (like this) for a while, but only recently have students within the school gone public with this fact."" So, they've been enduring this for a while. Kay also notes that the teacher's costume is based on the style of Japanese Internet pornography, which translates roughly into English as ""exploding milk porn.""

So, what's going on here? Well, you know exactly what's going on here. Let's stop pretending. Women may not see it right away because generally their lives are not defined by their sex drives, but if you're a man, you get it instantly. What is this about? It's about sex. Stephen Hanna is enlisting other people's children in his sexual fantasies. That's why he's doing this in class. Having an audience of children gives Stephen Hanna a sexual charge. He's getting off on this. There's no question about it. This is the guy in the van trying to give your sixth grader candy. This is the flasher in the park. This guy is a pervert. He should not be within 500 yards of children. Period. He's a threat to children.  

Now, there have always been threats to children. In every society, there are people like this and every society deals with them swiftly and very harshly, but no longer in the West. Now, people like this are not punished. They are celebrated and then protected. Trafalgar High School, which is public, it's funded by Canadian taxpayers, is vigorously defending his behavior and threatening anyone who notices, so is the Halton District School Board, which oversees the school.

They just sent us the statement and we're quoting: ""The school board recognizes the rights of the parents, staff, students, guardians, community members to equitable treatment without discrimination based upon gender identity and gender expression. Gender identity and gender expression are protected grounds under the Ontario Human Rights Code."" Oh, the Human Rights Code. Really? Where are the rights of the kids? There are none.  

In other words, if you complain, if you're a parent who complains about Stephen Hanna enlisting your children in his sexual fantasies, you are the criminal. You are breaking Canadian law. For the most part, the Canadian media, the most supine media that speaks English, are siding with Stephen Hanna, the sicko. Other than the noble exceptions of Jonathan Kay, who we just quoted, and a small feminist blog called ""Reduxx,"" nobody is covering what this teacher is doing to kids.

The rest are effectively defending it. Toronto Sun, for example, went with this headline: ""School board prepares for backlash over trans high school teacher."" Oh, backlash? Trans high school teacher? He's protected. No, he's a freaking weirdo wagging fake breasts in the face of your children because it titillates him and if you complain about that, you're the problem.  

So, the problem is parents, not the pervert in the classroom. It's hard to believe this is happening, but we're sad to tell you it's not just happening in Canada. You see versions of it everywhere, including in this country and to be clear what this is: children being used as props in the sexual fantasies of adults. Children being used as props in the sexual fantasies of adults! Are you okay with that? Is any normal person okay with that? It's completely wrong. It's utterly outside the bounds of what's acceptable. It's not a close call and yet suddenly teachers, licensed teachers, are bragging about it on social media.

   

So again, if you were walking through the park with your kids and a stranger came up and started talking to them, say to your fifth grader, your five-year-old, even your 14-year-old about sex, what would you do?"" Well, you would call the police, of course. That's not allowed. It's a crime because they're children, but teachers are allowed to do it and then to brag about it and it's not stopping with classroom instruction. All over the country, adults are forcing children to attend drag shows. Watch.

So, just to be clear, as if it's not clear and somehow we're in such a haze that it isn't clear to a lot of people, these are sexual fantasies playing out in public and on one hand, we've also agreed, that's fine, go do your thing, but you are not allowed to bring children into your sexual fantasies because that's a species of child molestation. You can be fully clothed when it happens. It doesn't make it any less abusive or any less immoral. They're children. Keep children away from your sex life, sicko. There was never any question about that, but now there is, and it's a bit of a tip off that the same people conducting it are now trying to tell you that you can't use the word pedophile. I wonder why. Watch this.

That last clip was from the Protasia Foundation, which you think federal law enforcement are taking a very close look at and it's donors. Child molestation is a crime for a reason. It destroys people. You can't use children as sexual objects. Now, the person you heard from, Allyn Walker, worked at Old Dominion University in Virginia. She was fired after the video came out, but shortly after, Johns Hopkins hired her as a postdoc.

So, she got promoted. She was rewarded for making excuses for child molestation. Hmm and it's not just academics. You see, book publishers are aggressively trying to sexualize children. You take a look at young adult books recently. Most are just stupid. Some are flat out pornographic. In Fairfax, Virginia last year, a mother informed her school board that two books in the school's library, one called ""Gender Queer,"" another called ""Lawn Boy,"" written for seventh graders, contained material that you don't need to be a prude to think, ""Wow, this is not, something is going on here.""

According to ABC News, the book ""Gender Queer"" ""...contains explicit illustrations of oral sex and masturbation. The novel ‘Lawn Boy’ contains graphic depictions of sex between men and children."" So, why are they pushing this on kids? Well, of course, to prime them for sexual exploitation and anyone who said ""that's a puritanical take on this, you're being hysterical,"" get real. Get real! What's the point of pushing pornography on children except to sexualize them and take advantage of them? And they're telling us it's not really child molestation. By the way, everyone in charge seems to be fully behind this. Oh, it's so dark and then, of course, there's the medical angle.

At Boston Children's Hospital, they're cutting the breasts off of healthy children. According to a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, Boston's Children's Hospital did, we're quoting 177 ""gender affirming"" double mastectomy surgeries in recent years, roughly half of them run girls 15 to 18. Similar ""gender affirming"" treatments, specifically chemical castration, were offered for many years in Britain, (We're not the first to do this) at their infamous Tavistock ""child identity clinic.""

Now, Britain's government just announced it is closing Tavistock? Why? Because they've been sued by more than a thousand families who allege that ""children and young adolescents were rushed into treatment"" and therefore ""suffered life changing and in some cases, irreversible effects."" They should have known that. The data have been out for a long time, but people with a sexual agenda (not a political agenda, a sexual agenda) have pushed so hard to make this legal and then fashionable that we've ignored it, but the numbers have been there in 2011.

Researchers in Sweden released the results of a study that lasted three decades. That study found that people who underwent ""gender affirming surgery"" were 19 times more likely to kill themselves than people who hadn't, the general population. So, instead of covering all this (That's not a story, really? Sexualizing children, mutilating their genitals because you get off on it) our media is not covering this at all. They're encouraging it and they're hiding the reality behind euphemisms. You're referring to castration as ""gender-affirming care,"" castration of children.

""Lifesaving, gender-affirming care."" Really? Can you slow down a little bit and tell me what exactly that entails? Can you be a lot more specific? Can you bring pictures in? Show me what it looks like. Can you do that? What exactly are teachers talking to my kids about? What's a human sexuality lecture look like in my sixth graders class? Why don't you tell me?  

Speak slowly so I can take notes. The reality of all this behind the euphemism is horrifying. It's sexualizing children and they go completely hysterical when you point that out, because it's true and the real question is, why is anyone else putting up with this? In a healthy country with an intact social fabric, neighborhood dads would mete out instant justice to anyone who even thought about sexualizing their kids and if you doubt that, go ahead and try it in Bulgaria or South Africa or the Solomon Islands. Good luck. Let us know how that ends, if you can still speak. People won't put up with it because the instinct to protect your children is the deepest of all human instincts and it has to be. Of course, it has to be, but it's been all but eliminated in the West.  

Parents in this country and in Canada are far more passive. Why? Because they haven't recognized this phenomenon for what it is. They believe it's some kind of political movement somehow related to the liberation struggle for trans rights and therefore something you're not allowed to complain about or you're a bigot and all the moms think you're bad, but it's not a liberation struggle. There is no liberation struggle.

The battle for trans rights is long over. Trans people have rights. They can trust any way they like and not only is that entirely legal, most Americans have no interest whatsoever in interfering with it at all. This is a fundamentally live and let live country, and it always has been. That's the deal we've always had. You do your thing. I'll do mine, and we'll both leave one another alone and the overwhelming majority of the American population still favors that. Republican, Democrat, everybody's for that, but that's not what this is at all. These are not people who want to leave you alone or your kids alone. These are weirdos getting creepy with other people's children. That's exactly what it is said. Say it. That's what it is. Now, naturally, Joe Biden, who showered with his own daughter who said her sex life was destroyed by it, is now the lead spokesman for this lunacy.

  

Oh, yeah. Tell us more about how to keep your children safe and healthy, Joe Biden, Mr. Shower-with-his-daughter-guy. Are you joking? These are sex crimes and the people committing them should be punished. Now try and say that out loud anywhere but on Fox News. You can't. Why can't you? Because it's true. That's why. You can't see the true things. You can claim the earth is flat and no one gets exercise, but when you start saying things like ""all lives matter"" or ""sexualizing my children is a crime and if you keep it up, I'm going to hurt you because I'm the dad,"" say that, Oh, you're done. Libs of TikTok is being banned from the Internet. Why? Because it showed documentary evidence of what was happening. Some people describe what was happening as grooming. We're not exactly sure what that means, but if it's sexually abusing children, yeah, that is what's happening, but the term ""groomer"" is now hate speech, says NBC News.  

Yeah. They're being mean to doctors who castrate children and cut the breasts off girls. Yeah. This is not only happening. It is being celebrated and aggressively defended by virtually everyone with power. Take three steps back. We used to say, ""Oh, our society doesn't care about children."" That's not what this is. What you're seeing is a society that hates children. You would have to hate children in order to sexualize them because sexualizing children screws them up for life. Ask anyone to whom it's happened, period. No one should put up with it.

No parent should put up with this for one second, no matter what the law says. Your duty, your moral duty is to defend your children. This is an attack on your children and you should fight back.

735	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-point-ukraine-war-regime-change-russia	2022-09-22 22:28:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The point of the Ukraine war is regime change in Russia | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

This week marks the seven-month anniversary of the beginning of the , something that is still going on and isn't talked about quite as much anymore. The day that war began, which was February 24, two things were very obvious. The first was that there was no way the Ukrainian army would be able to win a decisive military victory over Russia and the reason was simple. Russia is too big. Ukraine is too small. The Russian military is many times the size of the Ukrainian military. Plus, of course, it has nuclear weapons. 

Russia itself is the largest country on planet Earth. It's got a relatively huge economy for the region and it's got 145 million people who live there. Ukraine has a population of about 40 million. It's the poorest country in Europe. It's got an average annual income that is much lower than Albania's.

So, just by looking at the most basic Wikipedia level numbers, it was clear right away that if Ukraine wanted to remain a sovereign country and of course, all of us wanted that for Ukraine, Ukraine was going to have to reach some kind of negotiated settlement with Russia. Pitched battles were not going to do it. Now, that's not a moral judgment. You can root for the Ukrainian military all you want, but it's still a fact and there's no getting around it.  

The second thing that was immediately evident about this war was how unusually destructive it was and was going to be. It wasn't just Ukraine that was getting pummeled, though it certainly was. It was the entire Western economy, including our economy. Russian energy fuels Europe. A recession in Germany was certain to lead to a recession here and in the months since, it has, a bad one. The longer this war goes on, inevitably the poorer everyone is going to be, with the exception probably of Vladimir Putin. 

We are breaking things that are very hard to rebuild. Again, this was very obvious the first day of the war. You weren't allowed to say it at the time. Anyone who did was denounced as a Russian spy. But it was still clearly true and the Ukrainians certainly understood it. Back in April, according to an account in Foreign Policy magazine, negotiators from the governments of Russia and Ukraine met secretly and ""appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement to end the war.""  

The terms of the deal were simple. Russia would withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Ukraine would promise not to join NATO, so each side would get the thing that it wants most simple and effective, and it might have worked.

But the Biden administration adamantly opposed this settlement. Biden's advisers didn't just want the Russians to leave Ukraine. That's what they told us they wanted on television, but no. Biden's advisers wanted a total regime change war against Russia, apparently to avenge the election of Donald Trump, which they believed Putin was responsible for, and they were willing to fight to the last Ukrainian to get it.  

On April 9 of this year, the White House dispatched its hapless cutout, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian news media, Johnson communicated two messages to the Zelenskyy government, ""The first is that Putin is a war criminal. He should be pressured, not negotiated with and the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, the West is not."" 

In other words, who cares what the Ukrainians want. America and the U.K. demand total war with Russia, regime change war with Russia and of course, the Ukrainians caught in the middle had no choice but to concede. So, days later, the peace negotiations fell apart. This was virtually unreported at the time, but it was the turning point in the war in Ukraine. This was the moment where the goal changed from restoring Ukraine to what it was before the invasion – and that seems reasonable to everyone in the West – to something very different, to a war designed to topple Vladimir Putin, just like we toppled Saddam Hussein and then hoping for the best afterward. That is clearly insane and dangerous, but that's where we are and from that point on, everything changed and that is how we got to where we are today, which is the closest we have ever been to nuclear conflict in history.  

This week, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine gave an interview to the left-wing newspaper, The Guardian and in it, he casually called for the United States to nuke Vladimir Putin. ""The other nuclear states need to say very firmly that as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes on foreign territory, in this case the territory of Ukraine, there will be swift retaliatory nuclear strikes to destroy the nuclear launch sites in Russia."" Parse that, and we're quoting, ""as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes""meaning before Russia actually launches missiles –  ""the U.S. needs to launch nuclear weapons against Russia."" n other words, we need to launch nuclear weapons now. Why now and how do we know that's what Zelenskyy meant? Because the Zelenskyy was responding to this warning from the Russian government on Wednesday. 

""It's not a bluff,"" says Putin, who we are told is insane, so we probably should take it seriously. He is, after all, running a country with the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet and he's talking about using nuclear weapons if the West continues to threaten Russia's territorial integrity. It's a conditional warning and, of course, threatening Russia's territorial integrity was never part of the deal. Right? You remember this? It's why you wore a Ukrainian lapel pin or put a Ukrainian flag in front of your house. Ukraine was invaded. The point was to kick the Russians out. That seems reasonable by any standard of fairness and decency, but that's not what the Biden administration is pushing for. They're pushing for toppling the government of Russia and once again, hoping that everything will be fine after that, someone better will somehow take over.He's bad. Let's kill him."" Heard that story before? 

In response to what Putin just said, Ukraine's government called for an immediate nuclear attack on Russia, an attack that would without question result in the immediate destruction of New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, the deaths of tens of millions of Americans. That's what he just said. Sane people do not talk this way, ever. If there was a moment for the Biden administration to shut this whole thing down and force negotiated peace, which they could do in an instant, that moment is right now before huge numbers of people die, but that's not what the Biden administration is doing. They are moving in the other direction at high speed and doing all they can to bring the West to the brink of destruction.

At the U.N. yesterday, Joe Biden accused Russia, not Ukraine, of making overt nuclear threats. Watch.  

OK. Putin is bad. Fine. Agree, but Putin is making nuclear threats. Whatever the reason, he is making them, the fact he is making them and the Ukrainians, of course, are also making explicit nuclear threats, is enough for any responsible person to say, ""now we stop,"" especially if that person is the leader of the United States, the country which is funding this war and that could end this war tonight by calling Ukraine to the table. Russian troops leave. Ukraine promises not to join NATO, everything is as it was in January of this year, and everything's fine. We don't have to worry about New York getting nuked.

But that's not what they want. So, Joe Biden didn't say a word about America's responsibility here. Again, we are funding this war. We could end it. They're choosing not to. He didn't say a word about that at the United Nations, of course, because they want war and neither did Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Watch. 

OK. So Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, is a buffoon and a failed rock musician, reading some paper posturing like a cable news segment about how Putin's bad. Yeah great. Got it. But sitting behind him in the shot you just saw is someone who is not a buffoon at all and that would be Toria Nuland, one of the people responsible for the disaster in Iraq. Now in a functioning country anyone who had a hand in the 20-year tragedy of Iraq in which America's prestige was gravely degraded, in which thousands of Americans died, in which we got much poorer for no good reason, anyone who was involved in that, including the lie that got us into it, would be disqualified from participating in American foreign policy forever, but Toria Nuland just ascended, ascended, ascended until she brings us to the brink of nuclear war with Russia.

So Tony Blinken is telling the United Nations and the rest of us that it's okay for Ukraine to threaten nuclear war on behalf of the United States and the rest of the world looks on with their jaws open, including China, of all places. Here's China's foreign ministry spokesperson yesterday. Watch.  

We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire like the one they nearly had in April before the Biden administration blew it up because they want regime change in Russia. Now, that's coming from China, which has a human rights record that help makes Russia seem like Sweden and of course, China has benefited almost as much from this war as Putin has and Raytheon and Lockheed has, but even the Chinese are not crazy enough to want nuclear Armageddon. In the end, all they want to do is do business and dominate through business.  

They don't want their customers to blow themselves up and they understand they're coming incredibly close. Only Tony Blinken and lunatics like Toria Nuland really want that and they are fully behind Ukraine's president as he declares that his goal is not ending the war and getting his country back, which is a fine and admirable goal, that most Americans support. No, his goal is toppling Vladimir Putin and turning Russia into another failed state. Oh, good plan. Here he is.  

So, a corrupt Eastern European authoritarian leader in a t-shirt is lecturing us about the community of nations and telling us this is really about the punishment that Ukraine demands. It's not about self-defense or getting their territory back. It's about regime change. Specifically, they're demanding a nuclear strike from us. How do we get involved in this anyway? But almost nobody in Washington is standing back to ask that question. They're full speed ahead on this. This is insane, but they're all for it. 

Adam Kinzinger just tweeted this: ""By the way, any target within Russia that contributes to the war is fair game, by law of armed conflict. There's no escalation possible by a country fighting for survival. Anyone claiming Ukraine is escalating should stop."" 

Anyone saying things that stupid in public should immediately resign from public office and be silent until wisdom comes, please. Then over in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are in agreement on just that same point. They've announced that Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism. 

The fact that Lindsey Graham can go on television, as he so often does, and claim to be conservative and someone who cares about the United States, it's beyond. So, this is part of the endless posturing about how Russia's bad and sure, Russia's bad. Fine, Russia's bad, but it's the words, as always, that matter. They're telling you that Russia is now a state sponsor of terror. Why are they saying that? And you're probably nodding. ""Yeah. It seems like a bad place with a bad leader, fine, but state sponsor of terror?"" It's important for them to define Russia very specifically as that. Why? Because what do we do with terror states? We topple their governments. We go on the offensive. We take the fight to them and that's the position of Washington on a bipartisan level and it's particularly the position of people who believe falsely, speaking of election-related conspiracy theories, that Vladimir Putin stole the 2016 election and no one believes that lunacy more fervently than the lady who lost. Here she is. 

If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Republicans who, when this broke out in February, thought ""Well, this is awful. You shouldn't invade a sovereign country"" and of course, we agreed with that, we should stand with Ukraine, you may feel a little fooled at this point, because what you're watching is classic mission creep. We arrive for one purpose and we extend the stay for an entirely different purpose that you didn't sign up for and that will absolutely hurt the United States long-term. 

When Hillary Clinton says we're going to  as he goes on the offensive, that does not mean expelling Russian troops from his country, which everyone would agree with. That means toppling Vladimir Putin and creating a black hole in the center of Eastern Europe, the place where Asia meets Europe in a country with some of the biggest energy reserves on the planet and the largest nuclear arsenal. How is that going to work out? Well, let's listen to the Pentagon spokesmen. They're going on television to explain.  

So again, anybody who had a hand in, say, like the last five wars that diminished American power, killed Americans, made us poorer, hurt the United States long-term in very real ways, anyone who participated in any of that should probably bow out of the conversation about the latest war for the same reason that you wouldn't say take financial advice from someone who has gone bankrupt or go to marriage counseling with someone who's been divorced three times because they've demonstrably failed in their area of so-called expertise and that would include virtually everyone you hear talking about this stuff. ""He is going to continue making these threats,""   

So, these are apparently the only threats that we object to. If Ukraine wants us to launch a preemptive nuclear strike in their behalf, that's totally fine. This is complete craziness. This is a ""strategy"" that could very easily bring the total destruction of the West and soon and maybe that's the point.

736	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-joe-biden-senile-democratic-party-devolving	2022-09-23 22:03:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Joe Biden is senile, but the Democratic Party is devolving | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson shines light on blunders from President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It is Friday so you're probably wondering how your trillion-dollar Build Back Better project is going, the one that  promised would save us from the problems his party manufactured during COVID. Well, there are a lot of ways to measure the progress of Build Back Better.  

Let's start with the most obvious: poverty. Poverty is rising fast in the United States. The financial markets have sunk to below where they were in the middle of the so-called pandemic when Joe Biden took office. If you've been brave enough to follow the dissent of your 401k this week, keep in mind that it's actually worse than it appears. 

Whatever you think you have, has been devalued by inflation. So, not only do you have less, you can buy less with it. If you multiply that by an entire country, you see why household net worth is declining faster than it has at any time in the history of the country, and that's why millions of Americans are now not just thinking about postponing their retirement, they're considering move to Tijuana to afford housing and dentistry and gasoline.  

The economy, in other words, is not getting better and no informed person seems to think it's going to get better any time soon. So, what does Joe Biden, who promised to fix it, think of that? It would be interesting to know. Unfortunately, he spoke in Washington today. He didn't really tell us. Instead, he got, as he often does, sidetracked and went off about some relationship he had with a 12-yeaf- old girl. Watch this.  

  

It's hilarious. ""We go back a long way. She was 12. I was 30, anyway."" What? What was Joe Biden talking about? Who is he talking about? What exactly was he describing? It sounded like a late life confession. We don't know actually. For once, the  is not clarifying what Joe Biden said. They're just walking away slowly. And The New York Times is never going to get to the bottom of it, obviously, not just because they're Democratic partisans, which they are, but because, like everybody else, they don't take Joe Biden very seriously when he talks.  

Whatever Biden's other talents may be—shelling for credit card companies or having Michael Jackson level plastic surgery or showering with his daughter—he has a lot of trouble talking. He's not good at that. He rambles. He doesn't finish his thoughts, such as they are. He makes bizarre, unexplained claims like the one you just heard. Joe Biden, again, whatever you say about him, is not an articulate man. It's not a partisan point. It's universally acknowledged. Like the illegal aliens he's allowed into this country by the millions, Joe Biden can barely speak English. 

So obviously, Joe Biden is old and senile. He's 79 and at that age, sentences, like stairs, become a challenge. We're not judging, by the way. Anyone who's passed 50 can feel the loss of acuity if you're being honest. There comes a day when you realize I'm just not going be able to finish the Rubik's Cube this week. The older you get, the less sharp you become. That's the natural process, or so we have always assumed, but recently we've noticed something that changed our view, and that something is called . Or is it Karmela? She's on tape using both translations, so your guess is as good as ours. As a kind of tiebreaker, we're go ahead and call her Karmela, but it doesn't matter.  

The point is, if you're not even certain how to pronounce your own first name, you're likely senile, but here's the thing. Karmela Harris is only 57-years-old. She's 22 years younger than Joe Biden, young enough to be his daughter, which is to say, young enough to shower with him and too young for most kinds of dementia. So, of course, she's probably medically in her right mind, and yet, despite that fact, here's how Karmela Harris actually speaks.  

We could go on, but to be clear, a community bank is in the community, of course. So, it turns out that if anything, if we're being honest, Karmela Harris is even less articulate than the mannequin whose job she wants to take and that's odd. It seems so natural. Do Democratic politicians get dumber as they get younger? Have they inverted the process of cognitive decline? That would seem to defy the laws of nature, but the facts suggest it is happening and we know this from watching John Fetterman. 

John Fetterman is only 53. 53 by any measure, certainly from the perspective of those of us who are 53, seems pretty darn young, really just hitting your stride and yet, when John Fetterman opens his mouth to reveal mossy, unbrushed teeth, he makes Joe Biden and Kamala Harris look like William F. Buckley on Adderall, silver-tongued and supernaturally fluent. Check out this war crime against the language.  

""Now that's unfair,"" you say, ""because John Fetterman had a stroke this spring."" And that's true, by the way, not that it stopped him from running for U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania and we do feel sorry for him, but even before his current brain damage, Fetterman was like this. Listening to John Fetterman was like hearing a car backfire. There were loud and jarring noises, but you couldn't be certain what they were. Was it gunfire? Was it fireworks? You didn't know. It definitely wasn't human language and at the time, Fetterman was many years away from qualifying for Social Security so you could not blame Alzheimer's and even when his words were, strictly speaking, intelligible. They still, when you added them together, made no sense.

In March of 2021, to name one example, Fetterman demanded the release of all 1,200 people, all of them, held in prison in Pennsylvania for second-degree murder. Watch. 

Even Joe Biden wouldn't say that. It's too stupid. So, it's hard to avoid the conclusion in the Democratic Party, at least at the leadership level, they're getting dumber as they get younger and you know this from looking at the party's future standard bearer, Sandy Cortez. Sandy Cortez is even younger than John Fetterman. She's young enough to be his daughter in fact. She's 32 and as far as we know, she has not had a stroke.  

Sandy Cortez grew up in a generation that has carried a computer in their pocket since childhood with instant access to every recorded fact in history and then she majored in international relations at the highly prestigious Boston University, which some say is accredited, so she said every advantage, and she currently enjoys the greatest advantage of all we thought, which is youth. So, you would imagine that Sandy Cortez would be Churchill in yoga pants, a magician with words and data, a master of linguistics and erudite discourse. Oh, no, no. She's this. 

Sandy Cortez has devolved to the point where she doesn't even bother to make political arguments. She whines about men as she applies eyeshadow in the ladies room just like they do at every restaurant in New York City on a Saturday night and then expects you to support, say, banning passenger cars as a result.  

So, we make fun of Joe Biden all the time, but even senile old Joe Biden can muster more than that. So once again, how do we explain this? Well, in effect, Democrats are challenging the core premise of Charles Darwin. They're devolving. Our surgeon general just uploaded a picture of himself enjoying an ice cream cone without any ice cream in it. Really? The presidential debates are going to take place two years from now.  

Now, we've always said, obviously, they're going to dump Joe Biden because he can't handle it. Now we're beginning to think they're going to stick with Joe Biden because he's clearly the smartest person in a leadership position at the Democratic Party. Now, we don't know. We're not privy to the discussions, but when that candidate is chosen and appears on stage two years from now, we know exactly the argument that person will make because it's inevitable and here it is. 

  

So, that's where we're headed. If you no longer respect language (and they don't), after all you no longer use language (and they won't) and you're left with merely a primal scream. Bet on it. That's coming.

737	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-live-fake-democracy-revolution-like-italy	2022-09-26 22:53:00	TUCKER CARLSON: We live in a fake democracy - and there will be a revolution like Italy | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the election of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Not a lot of Americans pay attention to European politics unless they're very bored or work at some think tank. And that's understandable, but it's a shame, really, because if you look closely what's happening in Europe, you can learn a lot about what's happening here. Despite the castles and the funny accents and the smelly cheese, Europe is not actually that different from the United States, at least in this way. European leaders run their countries pretty much the same way our leaders run our country. They yammer on endlessly about democracy, but then at the same time, they do their best to avoid democracy's most basic requirements like free speech and representative government. 

A few years ago, the  at the time, Paolo Gentiloni, bragged to the World Economic Forum about his plans to ""bring more social justice to the country"" by which he meant importing many more thousands of poorly-educated economic migrants from the Third World into Italy. ""We are very open on migration,"" he said. ""We are saving lives at sea."" Oh, saving lives, huh? Congratulations. You're such a good person. But the question is, and it's a relevant question in a democracy, what of the people who live in Italy, that would be your constituents, think of that idea?  

Well, as the prime minister explained, he didn't care. ""A demand for more democracy not only is wrong, it's even dangerous."" You following this? You run a country in the name of the people. You're not a king. You're a democratically-elected leader. You run it in the name of the people who live there, but at the same time, it's ""dangerous"" to let the opinions of those people influence your decisions. Does that sound familiar? Oh, it does, because it's exactly the kind of democracy that we live in, which is to say a fake one. In fact, there is no majority in any country on planet Earth that thinks open borders are a good idea or that considers global warming the single biggest problem, or that thinks it's wise to quarantine the entire population because of a flu virus.  

No large group of people anywhere wants these things. But in the West everybody gets them anyway because politicians don't care what you think. Your opinion is dangerous. ""Shut up, racist."" So, it goes without saying this can't last. A system like this cannot endure forever because it's inherently unstable. You can't tell people they're in charge of their own government (It's a democracy, we promise) and then ignore over decades their most strongly held opinions on things that matter. 

That doesn't work long term. They will rebel, guaranteed and the best you can hope for is that they will do it peacefully. In Italy, they seem to be doing just that. This summer, a conservative populist called  started showing up with strong support in the polls. Meloni was no radical. Her views would have seemed perfectly ordinary just a decade ago, but because she resolutely refused to bow to the twin gods of climate and mass migration, people panicked. The president of the European Commission, in fact on camera, commanded Italians not to vote for her. Watch.  

Oh, if ""things go in the wrong direction."" In other words, if voters disobey ""we have tools."" Oh, you do, do you? Well, that sounds like a threat, because of course it is a threat, but it turns out Italians are so desperate, they no longer care. They're not afraid and they're not afraid because neo liberalism, which that lady is just espousing, has destroyed their country. Energy prices in some places in Italy are now up more than 400% over last year.  

Why? Well, a pointless war on Ukraine and self-destructive climate policies. It's not an accident and everyone knows it. Meanwhile, parts of Italy are becoming flat out dangerous. That hasn't happened before outside of Sicily, but it's happening now. Why? Everyone knows why, and government statistics show why. It's migrants who are driving much of the crime, a huge amount of the crime.  

These aren't mysteries, but you're not allowed to acknowledge them in public, period. In some places, it's illegal. But Meloni is one of the very few politicians who doesn't care and is willing to say the obvious, the truth, out loud and as a result of that, because she's been willing to say what everybody actually knows, last night, her party. called Brothers of Italy. won an overwhelming victory in Italy. They took both majorities in the houses of parliament. 

By Italian standards, in fact by American standards, this is a revolution, but unlike most revolutions, the person at the front of it can actually explain what she's about. She can articulate it in a way people understand. She's smart. This is part of the speech she gave earlier this year that led to last night's results. Watch. 

She's not kidding. She's as serious as the moment we are currently living through. ""Our rights are under attack,"" she said, ""The sovereignty of our nation is under attack"" and critically ""the prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack"" and that's true. That's why it's resonant, because it's real and not just in Italy. It's true here. American families are facing the very same onslaught from the very same poisonous ideologies. The difference is that in this country, it's rarely acknowledged except on the fringes. 's not on the fringes. She's the new prime minister of Italy. She will be and she's saying it out loud. 

Contrast that to what's happening in the United States. House Republicans just spelled out what they're running on. It's a document called ""The Commitment to America."" It's fine. Probably not much in it, you disagree with it. Have you heard of it? No, you probably haven't. You probably haven't read it. Nobody really cares. Why? Because there's nothing real in it. There's not a single word in that document about the attacks on the American family that you see every day. That's at the center of most people's concerns. How are my kids? Will they have a life that resembles mine? 

That was called the American Dream. Does it still exist? Will they be able to afford to live the way they grew up? Will they have the opportunities that we had? No. People are upset about that. Why wouldn't they be? But nobody says it and that's odd because we know and now it's been proven that when politicians are brave enough to tell the truth about what's actually happening, they tend to be rewarded for it. 

Once again, here's the incoming prime minister of Italy and as you watch this, ask yourself if you would vote for a candidate like this if you had the chance in our country.  

So that's the person is being described all over American television, including on channels they should know better as ""far right."" That's far right, really? Because she acknowledges that American families are under attack. Of course, they are. You think it's accidental? No, and she explains why and it's simple. If you want to establish totalitarian control over a country, of course you have to destroy the family first, because nobody with deep family loyalty, the one thing every person should have, no one who has that will ever pledge absolute obedience to a politician. Why would you? 

So, if you want absolute obedience, you have to sever family ties and that's why state schools brainwash your children with values that you despise and then instruct your children to turn you in as a thought criminal if you object. That's happening. It's not your imagination and it's happening for a reason. Wokeness is not just a political ideology. It's not just something annoying that emerged on college campuses that we can ignore. It's a state religion that supplants actual religion, which is also being destroyed. There's a reason the strip bars and the liquor stores and the weed dispensary stayed open under COVID, but the churches didn't. 

If you can't draw the connection between those dots, you're missing it, but Meloni didn't miss it. She understands it perfectly. Watch.  

So, they hate your family, they hate your religion, and you don't actually have to put up with it because it's a democracy, and you're supposed to be in charge, you being the population. That's a radical message? God, family, country. That's not radical. It's hard to imagine a more wholesome message, a more pro-human platform. Fascists don't believe in God because God is a rival to their power.  

Of course, this is a person publicly professing faith in God. That's so scary, but it is so scary. It's so scary to the people running and benefiting from our current system and why is that? She's not the first person to say this. People have said it before, but she's just been rewarded for saying it. That's the point. The population likes it. This is what they actually want. They're not that worried about global warming. They don't want open borders. They think the woke stuff is absurd. They want to see what they think. And now it's obvious because she just won and so even in this country, the people running and benefiting from a deeply corrupt and doomed system are hysterical. Watch the reaction to that.  

Its roots in Italian fascism. Define that for us, if you would, Joe Scarborough. Oh, sorry. You're an idiot. You can't, but the point is, fascist means unacceptable. Whatever this chick is saying, you're not allowed to agree with. They're very worried that that many Italians do agree with it. So, she has to be completely unacceptable. Don't read further. She's a fascist and in case you missed the theme, a recent New York Times piece on Meloni mentioned fascism or fascist 29 times, not a subtle newspaper. Apparently, she's on the verge of invading Poland. We should be worried. Watch this.  

God, family, country. Well, that's pretty scary. Not a word about climate or equity, but again, it's their hysteria and their total unwillingness to ask obvious questions that lets you in on the secret, which is they're panicked because they know the current system is doomed and in fact, what happened last night in Italy is the best case scenario for them, because it was a peaceful transfer of power. That's a good thing.  

That's what you want. In a democracy, people should be allowed to have some influence on the priorities of the government that claims to represent them and when they speak in an election, the people who've been repudiated have a moral obligation to pass just for one second and ask, why didn't they like what I was offering them? They have a right to an opinion. In fact, their opinion is at the center of our system, this democracy, but they never ask themselves that. 

They never take any blame whatsoever. They didn't in 2016, when Trump got elected. They immediately blamed Putin or Macedonian bot farms. They never blame themselves and so they never learned a single thing from what happened. That's exactly what's happening, not simply in American television, but also in Italy and also in the European Union. The bureaucrats who drove Italians to seek a change peacefully at the ballot box are completely unwilling to learn from that vote. They'll just keep ramming their unpopular garbage down the throats of a deeply ungrateful nation until there's an actual rebellion. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

738	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-what-happened-nord-stream-pipeline	2022-09-27 22:26:00	TUCKER CARLSON: What really happened to the Nord Stream pipeline? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the possibility of sabotage to the Nord Stream pipelines on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

I hate to start a Tuesday evening on a grim note, but one of the environmental catastrophes, one of the great environmental catastrophes of our time, is unfolding tonight off the coast of Denmark. The Nord Stream pipelines, which are enormous  owned conduits that carry natural gas from Russia to Western Europe, have been breached.  

As we speak, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 are pouring millions of cubic meters of natural gas into the Baltic Sea. Pictures from the air, which you can now see on your screen, show a toxic bubble field more than half a mile wide. You can only guess at how many marine mammals are being killed right now – countless. But the lasting damage may be to the atmosphere.  

Natural gas is comprised of up to 90% methane. Methane, as Joe Biden has often told you, is the key driver of global warming, which is, of course, an existential threat to humanity and the planet. So, if you're worried about climate change, what just happened to the  is as close to the apocalypse as we have ever come. So, the question is, how did this happen? And it turns out it was not an accident.  

At the very same time that leaks in these pipelines were detected, Swedish officials recorded two powerful undersea explosions, each one of which was equivalent to hundreds of pounds of TNT. Nothing in nature can account for that. Almost immediately, the pipelines began leaking in three separate places. So, there's only one explanation for what happened. This was an act of industrial terrorism. That was very obvious to the prime minister of Poland and he wasted no time in saying so.  

, he said, , an act of terrorism. Well, yes, we can see that. So, the question is, who did it? And of course, the prime suspect is obvious. It would be the same man who caused domestic inflation here in the U.S. and stole the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That be Vladimir Putin. The Washington Post got right to it. ""Putin,"" they declared, ""is now weaponizing the Nord Stream pipelines.""  

According to the Canadian ambassador to the U.N., Vladimir Putin has decided to use ""pollution as an act of war."" Progressive Twitter strongly endorsed this conclusion. and that makes sense until you thought about it for just a moment. Vladimir Putin may be evil. They tell us that he is evil, but is he stupid? Probably isn't stupid and yet and, here's the strange part, if you were Vladimir Putin, you would have to be a suicidal moron to blow up your own energy pipeline. That's the one thing you would never do.  

Natural gas pipelines are the main source of your power and your wealth and most critically, your leverage over other countries. Europe needs your energy now more than ever with winter approaching. If you can't deliver that energy, then countries like Germany have no need to pay attention to what you want. You're in the middle of a war, an all hands-on deck war, so you need all the leverage you can get. Under these circumstances, there is no chance you would blow up Nord Stream 1 or 2.  

Not now, obviously. In fact, it's so obvious that even as our famously dim secretary of State, Tony Blinken, seemed to acknowledge it, sabotaging Nord Stream, he said today is ""clearly in no one's interest."" Right, but really only half right. It is true that blowing up Nord Stream does not help Vladimir Putin. He would not do that. Why would he? But that doesn't mean that other countries wouldn't consider doing it. They would consider it and we know they have considered it because at least one of them has said so in public. In early February, less than three weeks before the  began, Joe Biden suggested on camera that he might take out these pipelines. Watch.  

If Russia invades that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again. Then there will be, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.  

But how will you. How will you do that, exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?  

We will. I promise you, we'll be able to do it.  

Notice how he phrased it and he's the president. He doesn't phrase things by accident, particularly his reading off cards. He didn't say, . He said  

 He was asked. They thought this through and yet those watching, very much including us, didn't take Biden seriously when he said it.  

This is the president who has declared climate change the most pressing emergency in the history of the world. This is the man who lectures you about using a woodstove or driving an SUV because of its emissions. This is the guy who spent billions trying to mitigate cow flatulence because methane. Would that guy really blow up a methane pipeline in the middle of the Baltic Sea? It was hard to imagine.  

That would be an unimaginably reckless act. That would be the kind of thing you would do if you wanted to start a nuclear war. It would be insane and yet in retrospect, it's obvious they were thinking about this because Joe Biden wasn't the only person to suggest it. Toria Nuland at the State Department said pretty much the very same thing. Nuland is a lifelong war cheerleader. She worked to bring about the Iraq invasion, never apologized, kept going. She helped engineer the coup that overthrew the Ukrainian government some years back. So capable, clearly she's capable of anything... but environmental terrorism? Even for Toria Nuland, that seemed too much too extreme, and yet here she is in January.  

 Now, looking back, those words seem chilling eight months later, as natural gas pours into the Baltic Sea and is in the atmosphere. So, you have to ask, could the Biden administration really do something like this? We can't say for sure. We don't know for sure. We can tell you that close allies of the Biden White House believe they certainly did do it. Radek Sikorski is a Polish politician who is chairman of the EU USA delegation in the European Parliament.  

He's connected. He's also the husband of regime stenographer Anne Applebaum of The Atlantic magazine. Sikorski is so close to Joe Biden that he's got a picture of the two of them together in his Twitter profile. So, when the pipelines blew up, Sikorski responded immediately and here's what he wrote. ""Thank you. USA.""

So once again, did the Biden administration really do this? It's hard to believe. Given that it's an atrocity, it's effectively an act of terrorism, we don't want to make that accusation, but we should tell you that maybe not coincidentally, today, a brand-new pipeline was unveiled, a pipeline that carries non-Russian natural gas in roughly the same areas, Nord Stream 1 and 2. This is called the Baltic Pipe. It was inaugurated in Poland. It will carry natural gas from Norway through Denmark to Poland and other countries nearby. And it's likely to do very well, since now it has less competition.

Making sense? What does the White House say about this? How are they accounting for what happened today?  

Well, they're not exactly enthusiastically denying responsibility for it. Instead, they're looking at the upside. Here's the president's publicist, noting that the destruction of yet another energy pipeline is yet another opportunity for you to buy an electric car. 

Oh. ""Moving to clean energy"" say that people who very may well be responsible for letting methane into the Baltic Sea and into the atmosphere at a scale that most people can't imagine. The people lecturing you about your SUV may have blown up a natural gas pipeline and created one of the great catastrophes of our time in its effect on the environment.  

If they did this, this will be one of the craziest, most destructive things any American administration has ever done. But it would also be totally consistent with what they do. What do they do? They destroy. These people built nothing, not one thing. Instead, they tear down and they desecrate from historic statues to the Constitution to energy infrastructure and no one in Congress is trying to stop any of it. They're just preparing for the inevitable fallout. Tonight, the Senate just advanced a spending bill with $35 million for the Department of Energy to ""prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine."" What? 

The spending bill also brings the total U.S. expenditure on Ukraine, the war, but also funding its government and energy for Ukraine to $67 billion on the eve of what could be a massive economic disruption here to our economy, $67 billion. How much is that? Well, it's more than Russia's entire military budget last year, and Congress is expected to fully pass the bill later this week with Republicans nodding along like the zombies they are. 

What would be the effect of this? Every action has a reaction, equal and opposite. Blow up the Nord Stream pipelines? Okay, we've entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world. It doesn't mean we'll go nuclear immediately, but it does suggest there could be consequences. If we actually blow up the Nord Stream pipelines, why wouldn't Russia sever undersea internet cables? 

What would happen if they did that? What would happen if banks in London couldn't communicate with banks in New York? Just that one piece of it, leaving aside its potential effects on our power grid, but let's just say the banks couldn't communicate with each other for one day. What would the economic effect of that be? We would cascade downward into your house. We can have an actual collapse. We could wind up very quickly in third world conditions. Those are the stakes. Have the people behind this, the geniuses like Toria Nuland, considered the effects? Maybe they have. Maybe that was the point.

Earlier this month, a longtime  agent and SWAT team veteran called Steve Friend came forward to blow the whistle on what he has seen happen to the FBI under Joe Biden and what he said was shocking. According to Agent Friend, Biden's FBI routinely uses heavily armed SWAT teams to raid the homes of American citizens who dare to criticize the administration. Now, to be clear, these are people who pose no danger to anyone. These are people who haven't even been accused, much less convicted of a violent crime. So, the point is not to bring justice. The point is to terrify and intimidate Joe Biden's political opponents.  

It’s hard to believe that's happening, but it is. Last year, to name just one example, the FBI's counterterrorism division raided the home of a 69-year-old Red Cross volunteer called . An anonymous snitch had claimed that Bolanos was at the Capitol on January 6, nobody did anything violent, but he was there and turns out that wasn't even true. It was a lie, but the feds moved forward and destroyed Bolanos' life anyway. They showed up with guns. They stole his electronic devices, and they refused to return them. The whole experience was so traumatic that Joseph Bolanos suffered two strokes. 

Well, on September 19, the FBI suspended Agent Steve Friend for daring to reveal what was happening, these abuses. Now it's illegal under federal law to punish whistleblowers, but the FBI did it anyway. And then four days later, with Friend out of the way, on the morning of September 23, a team of nearly 30 FBI agents bristling with automatic weapons raided the home of yet another harmless man with no criminal record. 

That man's name was Mark Houck. Houck is 47. He's a leader in his local Catholic community. FBI agents pointed rifles at Houck and his wife in front of their seven children. Once again, to be clear,  Houck is not a terrorist. He's never been accused of terrorism. He is instead a pro-lifer. 

Houck founded an organization called The King's Men. It's a pro-life group that encourages men to be leaders in their communities. Now, to give you a sense of who Houck, we want to play this for you. Here he is describing the experience he had earlier this year, praying outside an abortion clinic with his son.  

So that's . Now, he's a religious man. Not everyone is a religious person. Not everyone agrees with Mark Houck, but there's no doubt that Mark Houck is a peaceful, is a nonviolent person. In October of last year, Houck was standing outside another abortion clinic in Pennsylvania. He was joined again by his 12-year-old son. That's when a man approached and began harassing the boy.  

To defend his son, Houck pushed the extremist back. That was it. Local police looked into it. The district attorney's office looked into it. Nobody pressed charges against Mark Houck because it's not assault to protect your son from an extremist who's attacking him. But the Biden Justice Department decided to revise this view and they charged Mark Houck with a federal crime, a felony, obstructing abortion access.  

There was no evidence that he had obstructed abortion access, but that's what they charged him with. Now, Houck learned about three months ago that DOJ planned to charge him, and he offered to turn himself in voluntarily. That's what a civilized country allows, but that wasn't good enough for Merrick Garland’s DOJ.  

They wanted to punish him and terrify his family, to send the right message to anyone who would dare get in the way of the Biden agenda. So the DOJ sent a team of federal agents with rifles to Houck's home. He now faces 11 years in prison for protecting his son. Now, again, it's hard to believe that any of that actually happened, but it actually did.

When something this awful happens, something that affects the lives of millions of your fellow Americans, decent people step back for a moment. It's a moment that demands reverence and silence to consider what we've just seen and then the practical questions. People are suffering.  

How are they suffering? They don't have power. They don't have communications. How many homes were destroyed? You ask questions like that, and you try to assess what this means and the human cost of it. The one thing you don't do is immediately jump forward to score some sort of cheap and sleazy political point from it. That used to be obvious. But for the past several years it's been clear it's no longer obvious, at least to one political party. You saw this happen after the forest fires in California two years ago.  

It happened after tornadoes killed people in Midwest last year, and it's happening again now. Immediately on cable television on the floor of the legislative bodies across this country, self-described experts are demanding that you accept responsibility for whatever natural disaster has just occurred. It's your fault, including for . You did this because you didn't support giving Joe Biden trillions of dollars to fight climate change. So, you caused it. Watch.  

Decades ago, it used to be one or two a season, it would happen. Now, with climate change and these extreme warm waters, it's almost you know, it's happening all the time.  

This storm, in a way, is kind of bad news for the people that are still trying to deny climate change as a factor.  

Florida Republicans deny climate change as a monster storm barrels towards the coast.  

This will be a first-time test for how you adapt to these new stronger storms on a warmer planet as a result of climate change.  

The threat exacerbated, of course, by climate change.  

Charleston, like Miami, gets water that comes up on a good sunny day. That's climate change because water levels are rising. 

Our Earth is getting warmer and there is just no doubt, I think, left that it is feeding these beasts.  

Imagine taking a science lecture from someone as stupid as Stephanie Ruhle or Ali Velshi. So, on that level, it's ridiculous and it's also, as we just suggested, unseemly and anti-human. Of course. People are dying, so wait just a moment before putting forward your demands for more political power

But it's also factually untrue. So, you just heard one hare hat say ""it used to be one or two hurricanes a season it would happen. Now it's happening all the time"" and you hear this all the time, and it's a way of terrifying you into handing politicians more power over your life, but the fact is, it's a lie. It's not even remotely true. I mean, it's not a close call.  

There has been, as a factual matter, no increase in hurricane frequency in the continental United States from 1900 to 2020. So that's 120 years. It's been recorded. We have the data. They're on your screen right now. In fact, as Michael Shellenberger has pointed out, someone is actually looked at the numbers, the number of landfalling hurricanes has dropped slightly over the past century. Why? We're not sure, but we can probably guess it has nothing to do with climate or your SUV. We do know that in that same period, deaths of human beings from natural disasters such as hurricanes have dropped a lot by about 90% and the death toll is forecast to drop even more as people respond to the changing environment. That's what people do.  

Government scientists at the NOAA, even the professional alarmists at the IPCC, predict that hurricanes will become 25% less frequent throughout the 21st century. Oh, and that makes sense because the current Atlantic hurricane season is the slowest one in a quarter-century. So, none of that is to downplay or minimize in any way the savagery of Hurricane Ian or the sadness of what it's done to your fellow Americans. It's horrible, but it does raise the question, how exactly are you responsible for it?

 Well, of course, you're not in any sense. You're not liable for that. You didn't do that. You're a normal person. You're grieving for the people who were just killed. You're not trying to score political points on their deaths. But Don Lemon steps into the breach, the breach between fact and rhetoric with a brand-new theory. Don Lemon claims that stories may not have become more frequent, but they definitely become more ""intense.""  

So the  is increased and notice how, like all TV presenters, the claim has never proven. They will show you how it's true. They just assert it. They become more intense. So, how does Don Lemon know that? Because of a longitudinal study, he's done? Well yeah, in a way he ""lived in the Gulf Coast"" so he knows the storms are getting more intense because he's been in this business a long time. Well, is it true? It's worth assessing it since you hear it constantly and there's a political reason they're telling you that. Is it true? Are the storms getting more intense and if so, how much more intense are they getting? Well, we did our level best as a news show to get to the bottom of that. 

According to the latest models from the NOAA, the worst-case scenario is that hurricanes get 5% stronger this century. We're 22 years into the century, 78 years to go. So, hurricanes are 25% less common and at most 5% more intense. Do the math. Well, as scientist Roger Pielke put it, ""Even under the most extreme scenarios of climate change, future disasters will look a lot like today's."" 

So, it's not really about science, is it? Because actually there's no science behind these claims. No, it's what everything is in this intensely politicized country. It's another opportunity to punish people who don't vote the right way, to cow them into submission, to seize the moral high ground, to punish your opponents. That's why even as bodies are still being identified, and apparently many have not been in the streets of Florida, ""The View,"" which apparently still on the air, mocks the people of Florida for daring to ask disaster relief money from the federal government. Watch this.  

Oh, so clever, what an incisive point. This show is totally opposed to censorship or de-platforming or pulling anyone off the air. We're not calling for that in the case of ""The View,"" but it is an objective matter when that show finally does die, a well-deserved death and has gone and forgotten, this will be a slightly better country. That's just true. So, consider what you just saw. A hurricane devastates Florida, kills Americans, and the reaction of the morons on ""The View"" is to laugh at them, to mock the people who are suffering and while they're doing this, they claim it's really coming from a place of compassion. They're laughing at people who are dying because they're better than you. See how that works? Here's Joy Reid.  

So, we throw on a lot of cable news clips on the air and on one level it's like, who cares what the dummies on cable television say, but it's kind of a window into a broader political debate. If you wind up in a country where no one can think clearly, when the most educated Harvard graduates like Joy Reid literally can't think in a logical, linear way, they're incapable of rational thought, then over time, your whole country becomes incapable of rational thought. People just fall out of the habit of thinking like adults, and we're moving toward there. So, these are the very same people, by the way, who cheered as illegal aliens were removed by force from Martha's Vineyard and sent to a military base. They called them trash. They took them out within 48 hours with the Army. But now they're lecturing you about compassion as they gloat over a deadly hurricane.  

It's time to stop taking them seriously. Of course, they're not compassionate. They don't care about other people. What they care about is advancing the political power of the party they belong to and if you need more evidence of that, Joy Reid went on to explain that the hurricane, the one we just saw, is not a moment to stop and reflect on the fragility of life. No, it's another reason to keep our border open. Watch.  

Imagine when these people go home at night and look in the mirror. t, but nobody's fooled. Anyone knows anything, anyone knows any common sense at all or just the powers of observation that most adults have would know that what they're saying is ridiculous. Ian wasn't the first hurricane in Florida. Florida gets hurricanes every year and more Americans have moved to Florida in the past two years than any other state so actually, climate is not forcing people out of Florida. They're somehow moving there. It's one of our hottest states. How does that work exactly? They never answer.  

Instead, they tell you the solution to climate change [is] to keep our southern border open. Martha's Vineyard is still off limits, of course, because that's where their donors live. What's so interesting, even as they make the case that the United States deserves to keep its borders open, we deserve the punishment that we receive from mass migration because we cause climate change, that's the argument they're making, this is atonement for a climate sins, these same people never tell China to open its borders, even though China is by far the largest carbon emitter and the largest polluter in conventional terms in the world. But no one's ever in China's face about being an ethno-state, or racist, not letting non-Han Chinese into the country, which they don't. 

They have no moral obligation to let Burkina Faso move to Beijing. Why is that exactly? In fact, leaders of the Democratic Party defended China. They defend China. The same people who tell you that climate change is the most important issue in the world, China, of course, the main driver of climate change, by their definition, carbon emissions. Those same people tell you that China is doing a great job, and we're sinning. Here's our climate czar, the cadaverous John Kerry.  

So, John Kerry – who really is cadaverous, it felt mean to say that, but actually look at the tape and it's pretty accurate – John Kerry is basically doing an infomercial for the . This is the climate czar. This is the country that's built more coal plants in the past five years, in any place in the world by far tax and he's not only sniffing their throne. He's defending them on climate grounds. It's not subtle. They're not even trying. They don't care about climate change. They definitely don't care about natural disasters. They just want power, and that's why they suck up to the most powerful guy in the room and that would be Xi, Chairman Xi. It's unbelievable. How deep is their insincerity? Well, last year during hurricane season, Joe Biden leveraged these natural disasters as a way to sell his vaccines. Watch this. 

Sure, the lesson the hurricane is in tornadoes and tidal waves and earthquakes is to get the vaccine. Can we just have a natural disaster that we accept as natural? That's what they're called natural disasters, because we didn't cause them. They're products of nature. God's in charge. We're not we're not God.

But you really have to think you're not God in order to admit that, and they think they are God. They think they're in charge of the weather and that's why they just can't give it a break. They just can't let people die, and their deaths be observed for what they are, which is a tragedy that demands reverence, not posturing, none of their stupid political speech. But they can't control themselves, ever.

Two years ago this month, right before the last presidential election, the 2020 election, we interviewed a former business partner of the Biden family. His name was  and he told us a remarkable story. Joe Biden's son and his brother had entered into highly lucrative deals with foreign governments, including the communist government of China, in which they sold access to the United States government in exchange for millions of dollars for themselves. 

Now, on many levels, that was a crime. Joe Biden was aware of it when it happened, and Joe Biden profited from it directly. It was a strong charge to make, but Tony Bobulinski had the documents, the emails and the text messages to prove that it happened. We considered it a huge story, and we spent an hour on it in October of 2020. 

Two years later, we still consider it a huge story. Yet, in all of that time, no other major news organization in this country has bothered to follow up. The New York Times never interviewed Tony Bobulinski as part of an investigation into the Biden family business deals, which is strange because he was a partner with the Biden family. But then neither has The Washington Post, neither have the other television networks. They've ignored it. 

The FBI, whose job it is to enforce federal law, did take a lengthy statement from Tony Bobulinski back in 2020 and during that conversation, he outlined several felonies the Bidens had committed and he would know because he saw it and then he provided extensive documentation to prove that it happened.  

The agents he spoke to seemed shocked and they promised to get back to Bobulinski for a follow-up interview, but they never did. In fact, the FBI never called Tony Bobulinski again. No one was ever indicted for these crimes. The investigation into them was squelched. 

To this day, the  proof that the most powerful family in the country has committed crimes against the United States. That is the definition of corruption. It's unacceptable. If the United States is going to continue as a democratic republic, we can't have this. It cannot go on. 

Next month, voters will have a chance to change course. They will have the chance to repudiate the forces that have dangerously politicized and corrupted our law enforcement agencies. 

Before voters make that decision, we thought it was important that they hear once again from Tony Bobulinski. Over the last two years, he has learned quite a bit more about the business dealings, the criminal business dealings, of the .

742	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-explanation-allowed-nord-stream-government-wants-you-believe	2022-10-05 22:56:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Only explanation allowed on Nord Stream is what the government wants you to believe | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson takes on the outrage to mere questions about possible U.S. involvement in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

There are few things more infuriating than being lied to by your own government, the government you pay for, the one your ancestors risked their lives to protect. Does that happen to you? Of course, it has. It enrages you.

But if it happens again and again, if it happens often enough, if your government makes a habit of lying to you, then over time it becomes something else. Over time, you realize you're not really living in a democracy. You can't be because in a democracy, the government has a moral and legal obligation to tell you the truth always. Period.  

That makes sense because in a democracy you are not a subject or a mere consumer. You're a citizen. You are a shareholder in the system. You are an owner of it. The people who run your government are your employees. They're like your cleaning lady. You may appreciate the work they do (""Good job""), but the minute you catch them stealing your cufflinks, you fire them. Those are the rules because it's your house, not theirs.

But what if the rules were inverted? What if you caught an employee stealing, but instead of seeming ashamed and penitent, he whipped around and attacked you like you were the criminal? Well, that is the experience of watching White House spokesman John Kirby talk about the destruction of the . Anyone who imagines, who thinks for a moment the Biden administration was in any way involved with that sabotage, directly or indirectly, is not simply wrong, no. Anyone who imagines that is a bad person, a tool of Vladimir Putin. Watch. 

Notice Bret Baier asked the question, ""Did the U.S., did the Biden administration or any of its proxies have anything to do with the sabotage?"" To which John Kirby says we didn't do it and then moves right to the point, which is anyone who says we did it is repeating Russian propaganda. That's what John Kirby said.  

That's the kind of thing the only truly bad people say. Ok, if the White House says so, obviously we have no choice but to believe it, but you still have to wonder not everyone does believe that. Why?  

Where might some Americans have gotten the notion that the Biden administration might have been involved directly or through a proxy in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines? Why would they think that? They certainly didn't watch it on Russia Today. RT has been pulled off the air. They didn't hear it from Putin or any of his ministers. 

You can barely find anything from the Russian government on Google and of course, any book sympathetic to Putin has been banned on Amazon. In fact, every piece of information that reflects the modern Russian point of view has been censored in the United States because this is a free country fighting for democracy. You just can't read what you want or think what you want. 

So actually, if you think about it, if Americans are deluded about what happened to the Nord Stream pipeline, the delusion didn't come from Moscow because there's no way for Moscow to get this disinformation to the United States because the U.S. government has blocked it along with the tech companies. So, where did that idea come from? Why might they think that?

Well, maybe they learned it from Joe Biden himself. He's the president. Here's Biden this winter on American television pledging to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia does something he doesn't want them to do.  

So, that's about as clear as it gets. Biden doesn't say we will shut it down. He will say, ""There will be no Nord Stream pipeline. We will put an end to it."" And the reporter says, ""But wait a second, it's not your pipeline. How will you be able to do that?"" So, he has a chance to reframe the question, to revise his answer, to be more precise, but he doesn't. He says flat out, ""I promise you will be able to take out Nord Stream."" Joe Biden, president of the United States.  

So, there's that clue and that is as if that wasn't enough, last week, last Friday, the secretary of state in the Biden administration, Mr. Tony Blinken, bragged about how great the sabotage of Nord Stream was and we're quoting ""It's a tremendous opportunity,"" said Tony Blinken.  So, that might be another clue that the Biden administration may have had something to do with it.  

Oh, but no, says the White House, despite the fact that we promised we would do it, and then we crowed about how great it was after it happened, we had nothing at all to do with it. Who did it? Well, Russia did it. They blew up their own pipeline, making their own country poorer and weaker in the middle of a major war because that's how crazy but also diabolically effective the Russians are: suicidal, yet brilliant and if you don't buy that story uncritically, if you have any questions about how exactly that might work, you're a disloyal American. Shut up. 

Here's Chris Stewart, a Republican member of Congress from Utah, making the very same point. 

It's just so great. I mean, it's perfectly bipartisan here. You have a Republican from Utah, Chris Stewart, and a Democrat from Massachusetts, Seth Moulton, agreeing precisely.  That's the bipartisan view in Washington. What's interesting is they don't really know that. They have no evidence that that's true. Briefers from the intel agencies have, as of this afternoon, told members of Congress they have no idea who committed industrial terrorism against these pipelines. Now, that itself is a lie, of course. The CIA has no idea at all? Right, they have no idea, but as far as members of Congress, Chris Stewart and Seth Moulton know, there is no evidence either way. They have no facts. That is a fact. They have no facts.  

So, again, as a factual matter, neither of those guys nor any member of Congress, no matter what committee they sit on, has any idea who did this, but if you suggest the obvious, Russia probably didn't do it, because why would they do it, it's against their own interest, no matter what dumb story you're trying to sell us, if you suggest that, if you apply common sense, you're evil, and then they go farther and say things that are like completely implausible. Seth Moulton and we're quoting, ""The last thing we want is to raise gas prices in Europe."" Really? Seth Moulton, is that true? Because isn't the Biden administration philosophically opposed to low gas prices? Aren't they opposed to all fossil fuels? Oh, right, they are. How do we know that? Is that Russian propaganda? No, because we can't read Russian propaganda because it's been banned in favor of our propaganda. We know that because Joe Biden himself has said so many times on television. Okay. So maybe there is a motive here. Maybe there's more than one motive, but don't ask because, warn the media, asking obvious questions is forbidden.  

Really? Is it really? Probably just a thought experiment here. A lot of Americans who don't feel any allegiance whatsoever to Russia, don't like Putin (Why would you, if you're an American?) but care a lot about their own country and the behavior of their own government. So, their own government (Again the one they pay for. The one they supposedly control), is doing things contrary to their interests and then lying about it.  

Maybe they think they have a right to know and ask obvious questions like, ""Are you lying? And if you're not lying, speak slowly and tell us how your story, the one you're expecting us to believe, makes sense."" It's possible that asking questions is a patriotic duty of Americans.   

 There was a moment after it was very clear that the war in Iraq was not helping the United States in any way and in fact, hurting the core interests of the United States that the media engaged in a rare nanosecond of self-reflection. How do we get here? What role did we, for example, the New York Times, play in convincing the public that Saddam had WMD when he didn't?  

For that one moment you thought, ""Wow, maybe they're learning something. Maybe they won't do it again."" But it turns out the opposite happened. Now they're just completely doubling down on what's very obviously a lie and attacking anyone who asks to hear it explained rationally.

And it's not just the media, by the way. D.C. think tanks, whose purpose is long in telling what's the point of a D.C. think tank? Oh, to run interference for the ruling class, to bolster the regime of the Pretorian Guard. The Brookings Institution filled that role for many years. They just produced this analysis: ""U.S. podcasters spread Kremlin narratives on Nord Stream sabotage.""  

What's interesting about this analysis is that nowhere in it does the august Brookings Institution rebut the evidence that the U.S. or a proxy of the Biden administration had something to do with this. There's in fact, no evidence either way. Instead, they just attack anybody who ask questions. ""The theories pushed by these podcast hosts align with Kremlin messaging."" Oh, align with Kremlin messaging? They used to be called guilt by association. Vladimir Putin likes dogs, but you like dogs. What are you, a Russian sympathizer, right? In alliance with Russian propaganda? 

The point is, it doesn't matter whether or not it's true, it aligns with Kremlin messaging. Therefore, you must be censored.

But not everybody got the memo. There are tucked away in the deep recesses of American society, a few honest liberals still left. Maybe they've been, I don't know, in St. Barts for the last three years and didn't realize that you can no longer exercise free speech in this country. One of them is a professor at Columbia called Jeffrey Sachs. So, he went to Bloomberg the other day and was asked about the Nord Stream pipelines and he decided to respond rationally and he said, , but rather than follow up, the anchor, realizing that forbidden topics were being broached, () this just shut down the segment, but not before Jeffrey Sachs said this.

The anchor is clearly getting instruction.  

S 

  

  

The only explanation allowed, of course, is the one the government wants you to believe: Vladimir Putin is so evil, he's destroying his own pipelines.

, now known as Ye, is one of the best-selling musical artists in the world. He's also in recent years becoming a celebrated and very highly-paid fashion designer. And of course, for a decade, he was well known to TV audiences as an in-law of the Kardashian family.

But it's West's latest incarnation as a kind of Christian evangelist that brought us to his office in Los Angeles today for the interview you're about to see. Days ago, during Fashion Week in Paris, , accompanied by his friend Candace Owens, unveiled a T-shirt that read simply ""White Lives Matter."" The response from the fashion industry and international media was instantaneous and uniform – shock, horror, rage.  

There is no excuse for this, thundered the New York Times. West is legitimizing extremism, shrieked Rolling Stone, etc., etc.. What was strikingly missing from the coverage, however, was any explanation for why West did this. What was the t-shirt about? No one seemed to think to ask him, much less to listen to what he had to say. Instead, the enemies of his ideas dismissed West as they have for years – as mentally ill, too crazy to take seriously. 

But is West crazy? You can judge for yourself as you watch what we're about to show you.  

He has his own ideas. We can say that. Creative people tend to. That's why they're artists, not actuaries. His free-form  gives the impression of a man channeling his rawest emotions right onto Instagram. The effect can be jarring and it's often used as ammunition against him in the battle for influence over the minds of America's young people and that battle is intense. 

But crazy? That was not our conclusion. In fact, we've rarely heard a man speak so honestly and so movingly about what he believes. But again, you can judge for yourself.

Happy Columbus Day! Remember Columbus Day? That's the day that we celebrate the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus and all that happened after, which was the creation of the freest and most humane society in the history of man. We're still celebrating it, but we're also assessing what happened to that society because it is changing. 

We want to tell you the story of a man called Paul Vaughn leading off tonight. Paul Vaughn does not fit the profile of a terrorist. You'd never guess. He's 55 years old. He's a former pastor who now runs a small Internet service business in middle Tennessee. He and his wife are gentle people. They're faithful Christians. They spend most of their time raising their 11 children.  

Last Wednesday morning, at about 7:15 a.m., a bucolic scene at the Vaughn household. Several of Paul Vaughn's children are standing in the front yard about to head to school. Suddenly, out of nowhere, their world falls down around them. A team of FBI agents armed with automatic rifles swoop in in their SUVs and begins pounding on the front door of the family home. 

Inside the house, Paul Vaughn is watching this and he shocked, as he said later, ""When I opened the door and saw the guns pointed at me, I asked them what they wanted. They said they wanted me,"" and they did. The agents led Paul Vaughn away. Inside the house, his wife who had been at the back with their newest child, an 18-month-old baby, ran to the front door. Confused and terrified, she asked what anyone would ask, ""Who are you and why are you taking my husband away?"" We don't need to guess about the exchange because it's on tape. Here's what it looked like.  

: 

Body armor, little watch caps, automatic weapons held at the ready, taking off with her husband.Why are you taking him? Who are you? she asks, but of course they completely ignore her. ""No, we're not going to answer. We tried"" - when they didn't. They don't have to answer because when your husband is a domestic terrorist, the government doesn't owe you an answer to the most basic questions. So, Paul Vaughn, we now learn, is a terrorist, but what did he do? You may be wondering that by this point.  

Well, as the Department of Justice explained later in the statement, Paul Vaughn opposes abortion and not just in a quiet, personal way. That would be bad enough, but Paul Vaughn is outspoken about his views on abortion. He still believes, being 55, this is a free country with a Bill of Rights that allows you the freedom to say what you want and even have protests on behalf of your ideas. He believes that was the freedom that built this country. So, a year and a half ago, on March 5 2021, Vaughn and ten volunteers from a Christian pro-life group in Tennessee staged a protest at an abortion clinic in Mount Juliet. Now, we don't need to speculate about what happened next, and that's a good thing for Paul Vaughn. It was broadcast live on Facebook by one of the volunteers. That would be 73-year-old Chester Gallagher. Watch this:

So, you live in the United States and you watch nightly the chaos in your city, buildings burning, people being pushed in front of subway trains, people getting knocked in the face on the street for no reason, carjackings, murders up in every city in America. So, you look at that and you think, is that really it? That's why armed FBI agents with automatic rifles arrived at Paul Vaughn's home last Wednesday? Because of that? Because more than a year ago, a group of Christians, many of them elderly, sang hymns? Yeah, that's it. That's what he did wrong. 

Now we should note that we only have this video evidence because of the hard work of Mia Cathell at Townhall, which broke this story. God bless. Without this documentary evidence, without this video, you might be tempted to believe the Biden administration when it tells you that Paul Vaughn ""used force and physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with employees of the abortion clinic.""

Oh, but he didn't. He didn't use physical force. He sang hymns, but for doing that, Joe Biden's Department of Justice now tells us Paul Vaughn deserves to spend 11 years in prison. 11 years? Vaughn's ""coconspirators"" from that day in March of 2021, meaning other pro-life activists, are also facing long prison sentences.  

This group would include 87-year-old Eva Edl. Now, if that name sounds familiar to you, it's because she is something of a celebrity in Christian circles,  circles, and that's because she survived a Yugoslav concentration camp before escaping to this country, where she spent decades advocating against abortion. She has seen firsthand what happens when the government denies the essential humanity of a person. In this picture, you can see her sitting in front of an abortion clinic as a police officer towers over her. Within seconds, two officers are shoving this 87-year-old into the back of a car.  

Now, again, contrast this with the country you watch every night on television or the one you experience if you live in a city where people are afraid to go to the grocery store, where Wendy's burned down in the name of civil rights, and no one does a thing about it. Watch how they're treated. 

Same thing happened to 58-year-old Heather Idoni back in March of 2021. It took a whole team of police officers to remove her. Really? You wonder why. How dangerous does she look? Then there was 57-year-old evangelist Calvin John Zastrow. He was also arrested that day in March. Here's a video he shot discussing it:

Now, you may not share his views. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but be as honest as you can with yourself. Does that guy look dangerous and if so, compared to what? There are a lot of dangerous people wandering around completely unimpeded. In fact, they're celebrated by this administration. Is that guy a dangerous person? Of course, he's not. He's a Christian. Maybe you're not a Christian. Maybe you're pro-choice.

But even if you are, you are not, if you're being completely honest, going to conclude that that guy poses a threat to you or this country because he doesn't and neither is his daughter, who's 24 years old, Eva Darlene Zastrow. She was also apprehended at the clinic with her father. Here's her violent manifesto.  

: 

So imagine sitting back at Department of Justice headquarters assessing that video and saying to yourself, ""You know what? They need an armed FBI raid. Get out the body armor. That's a terror manifesto."" Apparently, they did conclude that because now Joe Biden's Justice Department, the FBI, to its eternal shame, is rounding up everyone associated with Paul Vaughn's entirely nonviolent Christian organization. 

Take a look at the mug shots from the FBI's investigation into this event in March of 2021. It's on your screen right now. They're telling you, the FBI is telling you, bragging about it, that these people are dangerous. and of course, you know what they know, which is in America 2022, whether you're dangerous or not, depends almost entirely on who you voted for.  

There are people in this country who molest children. True fact. You are hearing now that they are ""minor-attracted persons."" You have people on television trying to minimize the gravity of child molestation. Why is that? Well, because they're probably Biden voters. That's the assumption anyway. Meanwhile, those people in the mug shots on the screen, those are the terrorists. 

Keep in mind that Biden voters, who've actually killed people, are facing less jail time than these Christian protesters. Illinois BLM rioter Matthew Rupert received fewer than 11 years for setting fire to a cell phone store in Minneapolis. Oh, really? 26-year-old Montez Terriel Lee received fewer than 11 years in prison for setting fire to the Max It Prawn Shop in Minneapolis, a fire that wound up killing a 30-year-old man. He got less time than Paul Vaughn is facing. 

20-year-old Samuel Elliot Frey was sentenced to just over two years in federal prison for setting fire to a health food store, but it was for a good cause. It was for Joe Biden, so not a big deal. All of those crimes and countless others that are happening around the country at a scale we have not seen in our lifetimes, all of those crimes are being treated as less serious offenses than a man who sang hymns in an abortion clinic.

So, what's going on here? Well, a day before the FBI's raid on Paul Vaughn, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris announced their new policy, which is pro-lifers, because they disagree with Joe Biden and upset the base, are now terrorists.  

So, you think to yourself as you watch something like that, ""Well, of course, there's an election coming up in just a few weeks and a lot of the Democratic base believes that abortion is the key to freedom and happiness and they're very upset about the Roe v. Wade decision. Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land and so Biden and Harris and the rest of the leaders of that party are pandering to them."" 

What you don't think as you watch something like that, that its effect will mean sending guys with automatic weapons to Paul Vaughn's house and scaring the hell out of his 11 children. You never would have imagined that in real life, people who sang hymns in an abortion clinic could be facing 11 years in prison. So, you have to ask, since the parallels are very clear, this is effectively the modern version of Bull Connor's fire hoses and German Shepherds, has a single Democrat pointed out that this is insane, that an 11-year sentence for him singing might be a little punitive?  

Has Sandy Cortez said anything?  Has Rashida Tlaib? What about George Gascon or Larry Krasner? The guys who think, ""Well, we put away too many people in prison. We got to pull back a little bit. We got to rehabilitate them."" What about the compassion mongers at CNN or MSNBC? Have they said a word about this? As their country becomes totalitarian, have they even noticed? We checked. No. The only clip we could find was Nancy Pelosi, where she endorses violence against her political enemies. Here she is.:

First of all, you're not a Catholic. I mean, this is ridiculous. Let's stop pretending. Second, you don't believe at all of the right to choose. You applauded as nurses got fired because they didn't want to take the mandatory vax because they did want to hurt their own fertility. They wanted to have children maybe some day and you thought that was great. So, it wasn't their body, their choice. You're a liar and a fraud. You're not a Christian. Be quiet.

But what's really stunning is nobody the people who've lectures for years, the criminal justice system is just to mean that MS-13 are children of God. They have a problem with us at all. The people who claim to hate mass incarceration, it turns out, are strongly for the mass incarceration of anyone who disagrees with them, and they're doing it. 

As Julie Kelly has reported relentlessly, judges have sentenced dozens of January 6 defendants to months in prison, followed by probation. Why? Oh, because they entered a public building as police officers stood by, lifted the ropes for them. What was that about, by the way?  

As of this week, dozens of January 6 defendants are still being held in pretrial detention. No one notices. Where's the Republican Party in that? Nowhere. At the same time, the FBI has made zero arrests, none to protect pro-lifers from actual violence, not hymn singing, firebombing. The CompassCare Pregnancy Services center in Buffalo was firebombed in June. No arrests have been made. In fact, the FBI seized surveillance footage from the facility and never gave it back. 

See how this works? So, a group aligned with Joe Biden firebombs a building (firebombs!) and the FBI does nothing. Instead, they send agents with automatic rifles to the home of a 55-year-old man with 11 children because he sung hymns in an  clinic. 

This is too much actually. There's always going to be disparities in justice. There's always going to be disparities in law enforcement. You have to believe they're unintentional. This is not unintentional. This is intentional. It's right in our face, and it's completely unacceptable. 

Chris Wray, who runs the FBI, purportedly a good guy, a decent man who cares about justice, what does he think of this? Is this all right, sending FBI agents automatic weapons to arrest hymn singer? So, we called Chris Wray's office today and asked a simple question: Are you okay with this? You know this is happening? You run the FBI. No response just like Paul Vaughn's wife just shut the door. 

These are political raids, and they're exactly what the most recent FBI whistleblower Steve Friend warned about last month. The FBI didn't respond to those warnings from one of its own agents. It just suspended Steve Friend. So, the raids are continuing. People need to see this. This is going too far, and it's getting scary.

When Tulsi Gabbard won the Democratic Party's primary for a congressional seat in Hawaii 10 years ago, she'd effectively won the seat. Hawaii may be the most liberal out of all 50 states. It is a Democratic state, flat-out. It has not voted for Republican presidential candidate in nearly 40 years, so if you get elected as a Democrat in Hawaii, it's not exactly breaking news.  

It's standard operating procedure, and yet when  won that primary and then the seat, the Democratic National Party took a deep interest in her, and you can see why. 

Here was a smart, appealing 31-year-old who knew what she believed and could explain it fluently. And by the way, she was also an Iraq war veteran. So, in political terms, Tulsi Gabbard was near-perfect, and they got it immediately. Barack Obama endorsed her right away. Nancy Pelosi called her personally and invited Tulsi Gabbard (Do you remember this?) to speak on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. And then when she was sworn into Congress in January, the DNC named Tulsi Gabbard, vice chair of the National Party.  

She had just gotten there, and she was vice chair of the DNC and then, of course, the media played its prescribed role. If Nancy Pelosi likes you, well so do they. So fawning profile after fawning profile emerged. If you lived in Washington at the time, you remember it very well.  In case you don't remember, here's a selection to jog your memory: 

Did you hear that?. It's pretty hard to believe now, but that was the absolute consensus among Democratic Party sycophants until 2016. In 2016, as if by command from above, the fawning stopped abruptly, replaced initially by silence, and then by howls of scorned rage.  

So, what happened in 2016? Donald Trump was elected president and then a few days later, displaying the independence of spirit that Democrats claim to love in young women but actually despise more than anything, Tulsi Gabbard decided to talk to the new president about an issue that she cared about, which was U.S. policy toward Syria, a country that, again, Gabbard was virtually alone in pointing out has an awful lot of Christians in it, so maybe we should pay attention. 

As she put it at the time, ""I felt it was important to take the opportunity to meet with the president-elect now before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating, drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government.""  Maybe she didn't know, but they told her, ""Stop, let the adults do it,"" but Gabbard didn't seem to care. A few weeks later, she went personally to Syria. She was a member of Congress. You can do that, and she wanted to see conditions for herself and then while she was there, she met with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and that was it. It was over. 

Whether Tulsi Gabbard knew it or not, her career as a rising star within the Democratic Party came to a complete, abrupt and final halt. She had done the one thing you're not allowed to do. She committed the one unforgivable sin, which is to question permanent Washington's foreign policy. You can't do that, and everyone knows it, and if you look around, you can see that no one does do it. 

They always tell you how radical Sandy Cortez is, Rashida Tlaib. Would they do that? No way. AOC may be a socialist, but in the end, she's with Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney on Team Raytheon. She does not cross that line because you're not allowed to. But Tulsi Gabbard – as someone who had served in the U.S. military, in fact was still serving in the U.S. military, was an elected member of Congress – decided, why shouldn't I say what I think? And so she did.

And for doing that, overnight her fellow Democrats accused Tulsi Gabbard, the combat veteran you'd want in your foxhole, of committing treason against the country she was serving. Hillary Clinton went even farther than that. Speaking of conspiracy nuts, Hillary Clinton, way crazier than Alex Jones ever thought of being, claimed the Russians were grooming Tulsi Gabbard as some kind of Manchurian candidate. You want to listen to lunacy? Listen to this:

Well, that's just completely whacked. Was she a crisis actor, too? What a lunatic, but no one noticed because everyone was saying it. The L.A. Times, which at one point was an actual newspaper, accused Tulsi Gabbard of ""talking like"" a Russian asset, maybe a spy. So, the years went by and Tulsi Gabbard decided to run for president, still as a Democrat as she had been in her entire time in Congress. She'd always been a Democrat, of course, the vice chair of the DNC and so she wound up in a presidential debate in October of 2019, and she responded to the smears against her. Watch this:

They called her a Russian asset. Now, that slur is so common that we don't really think of it, but think about it just for a second. This is a transparently patriotic person, an elected member of Congress who was serving in the U.S. Army, who's also, by the way, one of the nicest people in all of Washington who is making traditionally liberal points about war – not that all wars are bad or war is never necessary. She's participated in wars personally. She's merely saying and has said dozens of times on television that wars that don't benefit the United States are probably a bad idea for us to engage in. That's all she said and for that, she was run out of town. 

Now, why is that? Why is that such an unacceptable thing to say? Well, of course, because there's a pattern here.

So, three years after that debate, another U.S-funded regime change war is underway and that is exactly what's happening. This time our stated goal is removing not some third world dictator who might have WMDs, but removing a guy who was the world's largest nuclear stockpile (6,300 nuclear warheads) Vladimir Putin, and once again, because Tulsi Gabbard has questioned the wisdom of this complete lunacy, Democrats are accusing her of working for Vladimir Putin. 

So, if you want to know what the Democratic Party actually believes, don't listen to what they say. . No, they don't. They want people who support regime change war. That's their red line. That's the one thing they will brook no dissent on whatsoever. They don't care what you think about that. They don't want to debate you on it. If you disagree or even ask questions, they go right to traitor.  

So today, Tulsi Gabbard did what is probably inevitable and probably has been since 2016. She , the Democratic Party, and we don't have to guess as to why because she explained it in some detail. And we ask you, please listen carefully to this, because it's inspiring and interesting, and she did it on a new podcast called ""The Tulsi Gabbard Show."" It launched today. Here she is: 

So, keep in mind, until today, this was a registered Democrat, an office holder, a standard-bearer of the , the future of the Democratic Party from the country's most liberal state. This was a liberal Democrat. Did you hear that? Is there a single word you disagree with? Is there a single word that the Republican who represents you, who you send money to, who you vote for, would repeat in public? 

In other words, here you have someone who, until yesterday, was a member of the Democratic Party saying things the overwhelming majority of Republican voters believe, but only a tiny, a vanishingly small minority of Republican officeholders are willing to say out loud, because it's too scary. Oh, it just tells you so much.

746	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-liberals-elevating-fetterman-same-reasons-elevated-biden	2022-10-12 23:03:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Liberals are elevating Fetterman for the same reasons they elevated Biden | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson draws parallels between the ways Democrats have used Joe Biden, John Fetterman and Greta Thunberg in their quest for power on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

 is a trust fund kid. He took money from his parents deep into middle age when he decided finally what he would like to do with the rest of his life, which is to be the U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. The problem is fate intervened and he can now no longer speak. He had a bad stroke and we feel bad about that. Everyone does, but because of that stroke, Fetterman now needs electronic assistance in order to communicate with other people. 

He can't talk on his own. It's not a right-wing conspiracy theory. It's not QAnon. It's real. In fact, it's so real, his campaign concedes that it's real. That is true. Fetterman uses a software program to understand the words of those around him and to formulate his responses to those words. In other words, to talk. Now, to be perfectly clear, this software is not a hearing aid. Fetterman doesn't need a hearing aid because he isn't deaf. He's not hearing impaired. Instead, this program takes words and then rearranges them into language that  because his brain can no longer do that for him. 

That's sad. For transhumanists, though, it is thrilling. This is an amazing moment. This is Neil Armstrong on the moon. Here you have one of the most famous politicians in the country merging with a computer. This is the future they imagine. They're thrilled by it, but for everyone else, for the voters of Pennsylvania, for example, it does raise some obvious questions. For example, where exactly does the software end and John Fetterman consciousness begin? 

We don't know. We can't know, but it's obvious that Pennsylvania could very well be sending a computer program to the U.S. Senate where inevitably it will be hacked. Yesterday, MSNBC sat down with John Fetterman and his thinking machine to assess where the man ends and the machine begins and the initial impressions were not at all encouraging.  

Well, good for her for admitting that. That's a rival channel. Don't watch a lot of MSNBC, but she should tell viewers that, and she did. What she just told you is that before the machine was turned on, John  human language, not even small talk. But once the machine was plugged in, he sounded or the machine sounded nearly human, but don't worry. Everything is going to be fine in the Senate as long as there's not a power outage. It's not like the electricity ever goes down in this country. We definitely have enough renewables to keep John Fetterman voting the right way for the next six years. Better build some more wind farms. That's the plan.

But once again, to the credit of the MSNBC.com reporter, she did ask a follow-up. How do we know your thinking machine isn't going to break, John Fetterman? Can we see a doctor's report on this? Here's how that exchange went: 

He's reading that off a screen and by the way, we're taking him at his word that there's not a staffer backstage typing out the answers because he himself can't formulate them. Now, again, you can feel deeply sympathetic to John Fetterman. That's sad to watch, but this is a guy who wants to run the federal government in a body of 100, the most powerful legislative body in the world, and he wants to be a member of it.  

Over at CBS, reporter Ed O'Keefe asked the obvious question, ""Will Pennsylvanians be comfortable with someone representing them who had to conduct a TV interview this way?"" Now, that's a mild way to put it, but it's certainly a fair observation. The guy's reading his answers off a screen with the reporter three feet away. That's the definition of impairment and again, this is a very serious job. 

But others in the media scoffed at the idea that was a problem at all. In fact, far from being a problem, it was an asset because if the equity agenda means anything, it means that incompetent people ought to be in charge. That's equity.  

As New York City Councilwoman Rita Joseph put it, questions about Fetterman's profound brain damage are, ""incredibly ableist."" Ableist? ""We desperately need more diversity in elected office, and that includes people with speech impediments."" Well, we desperately need that. That is absolutely right, but actually we're not talking about a speech impediment. She's telling us he's got a stutter just like Joe Biden. Remember they told you that Joe Biden's dementia was just a stutter? But of course, a speech impediment would not prevent Fetterman or Biden from understanding other people's speech. Huh?  

Investigative reporter Hunter Walker, who writes for Rolling Stone and The New Yorker, answered that question with a question of his own ""Would they treat a deaf person like this for needing assistance?"" Oh. So, if you have questions about John Fetterman, you hate the deaf. You're a hearingist, bigot. We're going to close down your bank account of JPMorgan, ablest. But again, it's not really relevant to the Senate race in Pennsylvania because once again, John Fetterman doesn't have hearing problems. He's not deaf. This isn't deafness. This is brain damage.  

The Independent's Eric Michael Garcia tried to tie up that loose end, and he used an analogy to do it. That's how really smart people talk. ""How is this any different,"" he wrote ""from Tammy Duckworth or Madison Cawthorn needing a wheelchair?""

So, John Fetterman, being unable to talk without reading it off a screen, either from the software or from one of his staffers backstage is exactly the same as being wounded in defense of your own country.

And then John Fetterman’s wife, who came into this country as an illegal alien by the way, wondered the same thing and we're quoting ""Truly appalling. Have these ‘journalists’ never heard of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Really curious to learn how they feel about wheelchairs and glasses.""  

Really? So, your questions about John Fetterman's mental health, the acuity of his brain, his ability to talk and listen and reason, use his higher faculties, those questions are banned by the Americans with Disabilities Act because he's not just an incompetent guy trying to take over the country. No, he's disabled. 

Over at Vox, Ian Millhiser  said he knows exactly how Fetterman's bigoted critics view people with eyeglasses. ""Is it the position of NBC News that a senator with glasses cannot be trusted in office because they use assistive technology to accommodate their disability?"" 

It's unbelievable. Not only can you not ask questions about the guy you're supposed to vote for and whether he can actually represent you in the United States Senate, you're not allowed.  So, they're hitting you for both sides. Vote for him because he's so profoundly disabled. We don't have enough for those in the Senate. But if you note he is profoundly disabled, you're a bigot. They got you coming and going. 

Have you heard this before? Does it sound kind of familiar where they take someone with an obvious impairment and then they use him to accrue more power for themselves? It's not really about the disabled person. It's about them and then if you ask questions about it, shut up bigot!

Does the name Greta Thunberg come to mind? That's the girl who is always lecturing you about global warming and how you are evil. Greta Thunberg is someone who needed help and concern from adults. At the age of 11, she lost 22 pounds because, according to her parents, she was so depressed about global warming that she couldn't eat and then she was diagnosed with a whole suite of very serious problems: OCD, mutism, Asperger's, very, very sad, actually.

But the people around Greta Thunberg and the people who used Greta Thunberg didn't see this as sad at all. They saw it as an advantage for them because Greta Thunberg could be used to accrue more power to them and you weren't allowed to say anything about it because she was disabled, which, by the way, you weren't allowed to notice. Here's Greta Thunberg: 

So you look at that and on one level you think, why is this person lecturing me, someone who's never had a job before is in charge of, like, our energy policy? That's crazy.

And then the other level, the more deep level, the more important level, you realize what a tragedy you just saw. Here is someone who is profoundly troubled, who needs real help and care and empathy and love from the adults in her life, but she's not getting any of that. Instead, she's being carted out like a sideshow freak for the profit of others. They're using that child in exactly the way they're using Joe Biden and John Fetterman and by the way, Kamala Harris, the dimmest person ever to work in American politics. None of them have any idea what's going on. And they're being used by people for the benefit of those people, but you can't say anything because you would be against people with disabilities and the ADA prohibits you from doing that. Right?

You're supposed to accommodate Greta Thunberg's disability, pretend her words are profound, just like the fake poet at Biden's inauguration. Oh, she was so great. We dare you to say she wasn't. She was ridiculous, but you did not because it's so profound.  

In Greta Thunberg's case, of course, the media loved it because they could use her too. They could use Greta Thunberg, didn't care anything about it. She could die and they wouldn't care. They would find someone else to use as a marionette for their own political ambitions. Watch them:

She turned that depression into action. Well, no, she didn't, actually. She's living in hell. Like most emotionally unbalanced children, she's suffering, but you don't care because you can use her. You did nothing to support her, to love her, to cure for serious mental illness.

No, you used her to take more power and if anyone says anything about it, if you think children shouldn't go on television to talk about climate policy and energy, then you're a bigot. You hate children. You hate Greta Thunberg; And by the way, as you sit and watch the results of the lunatic policy that she's espousing without even understanding Europe's energy grid collapsing, then you're a bad person.  

As Vox reported, ""Attacks on Greta Thunberg expose the stigma autistic girls face."" No, they expose the callousness and cynicism of her parents and MSNBC anchors and everybody else who used her suffering to their own benefit. The Washington Post complained ""Autistic young people deserve serious respect and attention, not dismissal as the pawns of others."" Really? Whose pawn is Greta Thunberg? Yours. Researchers at the University of Albany even published a study on ""Analysis of ageism, sexism and ableism in user comments and YouTube videos about climate activist Greta Thunberg."" 

So again, you need to listen to her because she's not well, but if you note that she's not well, you're a bigot. It's the same, exactly the same dynamic you're watching what the president of the United States, Joe Biden, who is not well and everybody knows it. Joe Biden mourned the death of Congresswoman Jackie Walorski publicly. Then a few weeks later, he asked, totally befuddled, why isn't she here at the event? But if you notice it, that happened, you're the ageist.  

This country has a problem with age so if you don't like the fact the commander-in-chief, the guy who commands our nuclear arsenal, is deranged because of age, which he is, then you're the bigot. But underneath all of this is this single most cynical political move in the history of this country, and that is elevating Joe Biden precisely because he is fading away, because he is demented. That's why they chose him. 

They had an option, actually. His name was Bernie Sanders. We're hardly endorsing Bernie Sanders' program, but Bernie Sanders could think clearly. And the people who run the Democratic Party just hated what he had to say. So, they picked a guy who had nothing going on upstairs, was flatlining mentally, so they couldn't control him. That's exactly what they're doing with Fetterman.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over not speaking out on the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Like all sorority girl narcissists, there is nothing the congresswoman from New York's 14th congressional district enjoys more than giving herself new nicknames. In high school, in leafy Westchester County, she was known as ""Sandy Cortez."" We still call her that because of all her various pseudonyms, that one fits the best.

And then when she became a member of Congress, she adopted the Augustan faintly exotic title, , which sounds like the name of one of Che's girlfriends in Revolutionary Bolivia. Just picture her in the back of the motorcycle in a beret, and then once she ascended, still higher and became a Kardashian, this very same person began going by simply ""AOC,"" Queen of TikTok.

But along the way, most people do not know this, she had still another name.  During the 2018 Democratic primary, in which she beat party stalwart Joe Crowley by attacking him for being White, Sandy Cortez went by the name ""Alex."" Just Alex, your friendly neighborhood, gender-non-specific bartender, Alex. On Alex's campaign website at the time, there was a section explaining what Alex believed. One of Alex's views read this way, ""Alex believes we must end the forever war by bringing our troops home and ending the airstrikes and bombings that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism and occupation throughout the world. ""

Now few people notice this because for a self-described progressive, that didn't seem like a very surprising position. And on the day that Sandy Cortez, Alex, beat Joe Crowley in the primary, that statement was still on her website, but then it disappeared. No one noticed except a journalist called Sameera Khan. ""Hey, what happened to the anti-war part?"" 

Now Alex, who by this point had morphed into Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, blamed the deletion of this position on her supporters, who she claimed were running the website and had done it accidentally. Who knows what happened to it? But Sameera Khan sensed there might be more to the story. ""How long,"" she asked at the time, ""will we be moaning on and on about single-payer while there's bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon?"" 

Well, that turned out to be a pretty good question, Sameera Khan. In fact, it's no longer a rhetorical question. There is indeed now bipartisan support for nuclear Armageddon. We're not making that up. Joe Biden said it out loud at a fundraiser the day. 

And then Republicans in Congress said nothing, which is to say they backed him up and Sandy Cortez, she stayed totally silent and that really is the point. Now, if you're watching this show, it's likely you don't really care what's going on in the so-called progressive movement. It's not one of your interests and why would you care?  

They're mostly trustafarian clowns. They're joke, kids with weird hair, pointless liberal arts degrees, stupid fantasy-based politics. That's who they are, but it's also true that over time, people like this can be useful. Sometimes you want principled people taking principled positions. It keeps the system in balance. You need that. Not everyone can be a mercenary. Otherwise, you wind up with what we have now, which is true insanity an iron clad consensus in Washington that we somehow have a moral obligation to destroy ourselves and our children's future in an utterly pointless war against Russia. What? 

Everyone seems to think that, and we mean  on both sides from liberals like Nancy Pelosi to conservatives like Joni Ernst and everyone in between them and that's a huge problem because it's insane. Someone needs to say it's insane out loud and break the spell, the hypnotism. 

That would be the job of a so-called radical like Sandy Cortez. That's why she exists. Now, you may despise her. Obviously, we do. We say so often, but at certain key moments, people like that have a role. They stand up and they tell the essential truth.  

And if Sandy Cortez did that, it might actually help. It might actually save the country, but that's not what Sandy Cortez is doing right now, because it turns out she is not at all what she claims to be.  

Sandy Cortez may hate White people, seems like she does, but that doesn't mean she's progressive, much less liberal in any meaningful sense. No, she's the opposite. Turns out she's just another stooge like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, a willing tool of soulless corporate power who always side with Google, JPMorgan and Raytheon against the working people she claims to represent. 

On no subject is this more glaringly obvious than the . That war provides absolutely no benefit of any kind to her constituents or, by the way, to any other normal American. For the people of Queens and the Bronx, that war is all downside, no upside whatsoever. So last night, at a sparsely attended town hall in the Bronx, two of Sandy Cortez's constituents said that out loud. Watch this.  

Those are actual progressives. Now, there's no doubt that on virtually any other issue, we wouldn't agree with them. I don't know what their beliefs are, probably don't intersect with ours. But on this specific issue, which does matter, they're absolutely right. Sandy Cortez is not a radical. She's not a progressive. She's a neocon, just like everybody else. She is a tool of the people with power. Obviously they can see that clearly because it's true. 

Her response? . You're being rude now, says the very same Sandy Cortez, who instructed activists to terrorize their political opponents. ""The whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable."" Oh, is that right? 

So, they were kind of following your instructions, weren't they? The protesters you just saw used Sandy Cortez's preferred tactics against her. They immediately seize the moral high ground, and they started yelling. And they got no response from Sandy Cortez. Why is that? Because she has nothing to say. They're on to her. They know who she really is, and she knows that. They were right. 

Shortly after she took office, Sandy Cortez funded the largest expansion of our nation's military ever. In 2019, she approved an unprecedented $738 billion military budget. Now, publicly, Sandy Cortez never justified this vote. Instead, she kept demonizing the military she was funding, right? Of course 

That was the TikTok-approved version that was for all the college kids on social media. But in real life, she didn't mean a word of it. The only part she meant was America is terrible. She does believe that she does hate the country. But pulling back from a war that will hurt the country, why would she do that? She doesn't like the country. Anything that's not in our interest, she's completely for and that's why this year, Sandy Cortez, along with every member of The Squad, the progressives, voted to approve another massive $40 billion military spending bill. Cori Bush even voted for it even after she admitted it would directly contribute to, ""the increased risks of direct war and the potential for direct military confrontation between Russia and the US."" 

So, to even Cori Bush, probably the lowest IQ member of the United States Congress, it was pretty obvious where this was going. It was going to war with Russia, but she voted for it anyway. They all did. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to sell this, which is, again, a step toward war, which does not help us in any way, only hurts us as a humanitarian effort. Watch.  

Oh. So, it's humanitarian assistance. Really? Did you look at the bill? No, it was a military funding bill. The real point of it was buying arms, more than half of it. $24 billion went to military equipment, weapons. $19 billion went directly to the war effort in Ukraine.

If you're an out-of-the-closet neocon, this makes sense, but if you're Sandy Cortez, who's all over TikTok talking about the working people fighting the man, what does this tell you about her? 

She doesn't care about the people she claims to represent. She has contempt for them. She talks about their misery, only to leverage it for her own benefit. She hoards power in their name. They are merely the tools of her personal advancement. They're not her real constituency. How could they be? They don't benefit from this. Her real constituency is NBC News, the editors at Teen Vogue and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the celebrity-endorsed dictator of the most corrupt nation in Europe. Zelenskyy is now shaking down our cowardly Congress for more cash at the very moment our own economy and our own borders are collapsing. Watch.  

What? Some uppity foreigner in a T-shirt demanding money for his critical economic needs. We have critical economic needs too, buddy. Who are you, troll? Go away. What? Since when does that guy have a claim on our Treasury?

So, this is the job of people like  to remind us again to break the spell of hypnosis the U.S. Congress is under. We don't owe this guy anything. Not one thing. Good luck, pal. That's it.

And as our economy degrades and our border is gone, that guy's lecturing us with some Christmas list, like, k. Really? Up yours, buddy. And at the same time, dragging us the entire West toward nuclear war, telling us we have to nuke Russia and what does Sandy Cortez do? She affirms it. She's not a progressive. She's a stealthy, neocon operative. 

The entire leadership of the so-called progressive movement is that. They're totally and utterly corrupt. Is anyone on the left pointing this out? Has Cenk Uygur  said a word about it? The so-called radicals at Chapo Trap House? The Atlantic Magazine, NPR, MSNBC? Are these left-wing media organizations always telling you how deeply they care about oppressed peoples, all them calling for radical race war every day. But when actual civilization ending war looms on the horizon, they're cheering for it right alongside the Pentagon.

  

As long as it takes to do what? Has anyone even asked that question? Has Sandy Cortez asked that question and your progressive pals ask that question? As long as it takes to do what? How long is that? What's the goal and at what cost? What's the risk? Should we weigh those?  Why? 

Because they're getting more powerful. Even as our country is getting less powerful by the day. So where are the real liberals? Where are the real progressives?

748	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democratic-party-replacing-parents-itself	2022-10-14 23:11:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The Democratic Party is replacing parents with itself | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to a growing movement to limit parental rights when it comes to children's 'gender identity.'

In your head, you always imagine the revolution when it starts. It'll start with tanks and gunfire with chaos and soldiers in the street. You'll know when it comes, but it never does. Instead, the really big changes to American life, the profound ones that affect all of us forever, those changes almost always begin quietly with gentle pleas for tolerance. they tell you.   

That's always the pitch and of course, you always agree to it. Why wouldn't you? Who could say no to that? Some guy down the street wants to wear a dress? OK, fine, have a party. It doesn't affect you. You don't have to wear a dress, so go ahead. Live and let live, but it turns out that's never actually the deal. The guy down the street wears his dress, but after a while, that's not enough for him. He's still angry and for some reason, he's angry with you. And that doesn't make sense because you're the person who had no problem with him wearing a dress in the first place. What did you do wrong? 

Well, the problem is you're not wearing a dress and neither are your kids. Your normal-person clothes, the ones you've always worn, are suddenly immoral. You've got to change immediately. 

, you say,  They don't remember. They don't care. That's not how it works. You don't get to do your thing anymore. The dress guy's in charge now. Everybody's got to do his thing, the dress thing or face punishment. That's how it goes. ""Be tolerant"" becomes ""show some respect"" which evolves very quickly into ""bow down before us and lick our feet or else will hurt you."" That's the final stage. That's where we are now.

For example, a Democratic lawmaker in Virginia called Elizabeth Guzman is introducing a bill that will charge parents with a felony, strip them of their employment and imprison them if they don't wholeheartedly endorse their minor . So, your 12-year-old daughter says she wants a mastectomy. If you object to that in any way, if you raise questions, Elizabeth Guzman will send you to jail for real. Here's a local news report.:

Who is this Elizabeth Guzman? Well, Elizabeth Guzman came to this country not so long ago from Peru as a single mother. Now, rather than wait a while, maybe spend a few generations here before telling you how to raise your children in America, she's decided to get right to it and completely change child-rearing in this country in a way that would never be tolerated for a second in the country from which she comes. Try that in the Andes, honey, and see how that works. Yeah.

But in this country, according to Elizabeth Guzman, you have to affirm your child's  or else you're going to prison and the state will raise your kids. 

Now you got to think maybe they've wanted this for a while. What would this mean? Well, it would mean fewer intact families. It would mean people like Elizabeth Guzman make the decisions, the meaningful decisions within your house. It means less resistance from you. It means more powerful them. What it doesn't mean is that Elizabeth Guzman will be protecting your kids. She doesn't even claim this law will protect your kids. Instead, she acknowledges the whole point is to ""educate parents."" Right. 

Like the COVID vaccine, this is a pretty easy way to figure out who's on which side. Are you for this? OK, you're on our team. You're willing to surrender control of your own children to Elizabeth Guzman, who, again, just got here. But if you're not for it, then we know you're not on our team. We know who you are. We can silence you. We can punish you because you refuse to be educated.

So, it's a signaling mechanism and you know that because the ideology that underlies it, gender ideology, is completely incoherent. It doesn't make any sense at all. It is not rooted in science. It's a form of religion that's so crazy it dares you to say something about it.You can't even say that. If you do, they know you're on the other side.

And it's not just lunatics and ideologues like Elizabeth Guzman from Peru. It's doctors, it's medical professionals.  

Here's a video from Boston Children's Hospital, one of the most famous hospitals in the world, which like many hospitals in the United States at this point under the Joe Biden administration cut the breasts off of minor girls for no medically justifiable reason. Watch a practicing psychologist, now attending psychologist, at Boston Children's Hospital explain how early children can become trans.  

That's Kerry McGregor. She's a psychologist. She works at Harvard. I wonder how many children Kerry McGregor has. Has she raised a lot of kids? Has she watched kids carefully? Does she know anything about kids? Because she's telling you if you're a little kid says, ""Oh I may be on the other sex,"" that means your kid is the other sex. Well, that's insane, because almost 100% of kids at one point or another, at a certain point in development, say things like, ""I think I'm a boy. I think I'm a girl"" and you smile indulgently, ""Get back to me in 15 years.""

But no, says Kerry McGregor, in the womb you can know.  

Think about what they're telling you. They're telling you that developing child in the womb is just a part of the mother. Therefore, you can abort that child at any time. It's like an appendectomy, but at the same time, that same cluster of cells, that fetus, can also be woke and ascribe to left liberal gender ideology and you need to honor that.

No sane person could believe any of this voluntarily. It doesn't even make sense on its face. Again, it's a religion and if you resist it, they resort immediately to force. No questions allowed.  Again, this is science and the essence of science is relentless questioning about what you think you know is true. That is the scientific method. That's science itself, but it's no longer allowed. 

The American Medical Association, which has utterly beclowned itself, along with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, just sent a letter to the attorney general of the United States demanding that the Biden administration, and we're quoting, ""take swift action to investigate and prosecute high profile users on social media"" who have engaged in ""disinformation."" 

You hate to always invoke the German government of 80 years ago, but what else is that? That's totalitarian. They're saying if you disagree with what we're doing, people with guns should come and take you away. Now you'd think someone in the media would point out, ""Wow, you know, we can't have that in the United States where people are free to believe what they want and to talk about it in public and to ask questions."" In fact, they should be encouraged to, but the media don't say anything like that. They're joining with the Children's Hospital Association, the AMA, to call for more censorship at gun point. Watch. 

It's so funny. Back to the point at the open, when the revolution comes, there won't be tanks and soldiers won't be stormtroopers in all uniforms and symbols. It'll be some unmarried 30-year-old woman talking in a singsong voice inflection at the end. Special glasses or complex glasses that don't actually improve her vision. She'll have all kinds of pointless humanities degrees and she'll be on cable news and say. What she's really saying is ""shut up and obey or will hurt you."" She's delivering the same message any stormtrooper delivers, but she's doing it in a singsong way.. 

Call us literal, but this is the opposite of disinformation, isn't disinformation. This is literally what they're seeing. Boston Children's Hospitals, which we showed you on tape, is telling you what they're doing. They perform double mastectomies on miners for no medical reason whatsoever. That's insane. It ought to be a crime. In a civilized country it would be and they know that because when they were caught, they tried to erase the evidence and they're not alone.  

UCSF, U.W. Health in Wisconsin, Golisano Children's Hospital in New York, Vanderbilt Health, Children's Minnesota, all of these hospitals have deleted the evidence of their gender-affirming procedures, their grotesque mutilation of children after they were publicized. Their own words were publicized online. No one's twisting it. People are just putting up their words and not all the videos have been deleted. 

Planned Parenthood is big into this now because it's lucrative. Here's Planned Parenthood in 2021 telling children that so-called puberty blockers are harmless. Oh, right. That's a lie and by the way, there's no such thing as a puberty blocker. These drugs are hormone agonists and they're FDA approved for things like cancer treatment. You get prostate cancer and they lower your testosterone, for example, to prevent the cancer from growing quickly. They are not approved for so-called ""puberty blocking."" They're unapproved and the long-term effects are not known, but it's pretty obvious they're grim, but Planned Parenthood won't tell you that. Here's their video.  

Everything about that is dark and horrifying and there should be an uprising against that. That's aimed at your children—not at adults who can make rational decisions—but children who are people too young to drive or drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes or serve in the military or vote, people who are not (we have agreed as a group) capable of making rational adult decisions and that's aimed at them. It's propaganda aimed at them and it's a lie.. They are absolutely not safe. You can't delay puberty without damaging severely the bodies of young children. The FDA just identified several ""clinically serious cases"" of side effects after these drugs were recklessly administered to children by lunatic ideologues. 

The FDA found a ""plausible association"" between the use of puberty blockers and something called intracranial hypertension. Do you want that for your 13-year-old? 

According to the Mayo Clinic, that condition can cause brain swelling, double vision, severe headaches, permanent vision loss. In other words, brain damage. Brain damage! Oh, great. OK. 

On top of that, the European Journal of Endocrinology, among many other publications, has found that so-called puberty blockers often cause, ""decreased bone density, which is associated with a high risk of osteoporosis"" and there are other permanent side effects as well. We don't even know the scope of them because this has never been tested longitudinally ever, but the effects are very obvious and if you poke around on the internet for about 4 minutes, you will see them. One teenage girl just uploaded a video showing the effects of five years of puberty blockers on her. Watch this.  

Yeah. That's what happens. That and a lot of other things. That's what they're telling you is ""gender-affirming."" No, it's mutilation. It's grotesque. It's destroying people's lives, children's lives. We made a documentary on this for ""Tucker Carlson Originals."" We spoke to a lot of people who had endured similar torture.  

It's just awful and every person who is participating in this in their moments of clarity knows that ten years from now, there will be thousands of vocal victims of this moment of true craziness and hysteria that has gripped our country. People's lives are being destroyed right before us. Most adults are too cowardly to say a word about it and the Democratic Party is actively doing all it can to promote this to protect hospitals that are mutilating and destroying the lives of children.

in the state of California – Always a bellwether – a legislator called Scott Wiener has just sponsored legislation to make California a so-called sanctuary state for kids who want to mutilate their own bodies to castrate themselves. Scott Wiener, really? Is he a good father? Would you trust this guy within 500 yards of a child? Probably not.  

Gavin Newsom just signed the bill, of course. So, what's the point here? It's not to protect children. It's not protecting them. Any parent will tell you if you want to protect children, you tell them, take a deep breath and reach adulthood and then make rational decisions about how to live their lives. 

You would definitely not let them make a decision, an irreversible decision like this, for themselves. You're their parent. That's the whole point. But the Democratic Party doesn't like parents. The Democratic Party is replacing parents with itself. We're in charge now. It's the most recognizable possible move for any totalitarian movement. Break up the family. Replace parents with politicians. The state is in charge. The party is in charge, obviously, and it's happening all over the country.

749	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-midterm-elections-democrats-running-fantasy-denial	2022-10-17 22:49:00	TUCKER CARLSON: For midterm elections, Democrats are really running on fantasy, denial | Fox News	"WARNING: Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson dissects Democrats' messaging ahead of midterm elections on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We are going to start the week by doing something we rarely do, which is bombarding you with political cliches. We usually leave that to MSNBC. But we're going to tell you what you already know, which is  are always and everywhere a referendum on the party in power. That's true. That's true this year, too, but this year, they are not just that. They're more than that. In just 22 days, Americans will have the chance to render judgment on the unprecedented moral atrocities our leadership class has committed over the past two years. 

The shameless lying, the arrogance, the stupidity, the total incompetence, the unfairness, the relentless and vicious racism toward the majority of the American population, all of which together amount to, yes, attacks on democracy itself. If you believed in democracy, you would not act like this. No one has ever run a developed country with this degree of recklessness. 

The question is, is anyone ever going to be punished for it? That's what's really on the ballot this November 8. So, for Republicans, the election should be easy, not that you should ever for a second underestimate their ability to screw it up anyway. They may. But the template for success is right in front of them. Just run against Joe Biden. 

There may be people out there who feel sorry for Joe Biden, but there's absolutely nobody who thinks or can argue with a straight face that he's doing a good job because he's not. So, just say that. You're not the . Run on the economy and crime, homelessness (It's everywhere. Have you noticed?) fentanyl and on what Joe Biden has done to our southern border. Stick to the obvious issues and you're probably going to win. How could you not? 

Surveys show that voters care most about inflation, jobs and immigration. As it turns out, those are exactly the issues, according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll, that voters also believe are the top priorities of the Republican Party. So, this is a moment Republicans rarely see. It's a moment where there's total alignment between their priorities and the priorities of the electorate. Again, that doesn't happen very often. 

That same poll, if you dig a little deeper, shows that voters believe Democrats, by contrast, are fixated above all on January 6. Oh, yeah, January 6, the QAnon insurrection. January 6, where Nancy Pelosi's cops opened the doors and let protesters walk inside, all of whom are now nevertheless classified as dangerous felon revolutionaries, except for Ray Epps, who for some reason is still a good guy. Ok, Democrats, that's a story they're running on. Lots of luck.  

January 6 might make for a spicy CNN segment, but it is not a governing platform. Who's voting on that? Nobody. At least one candidate seems to understand that. It would be John Fetterman actually. Fetterman may have brain damage, but he's one of the very few Democratic office seekers who is bothered to explain what he might actually do if he's elected. Here's John Fetterman at a recent event getting specific about his governing platform.  

Do you hear that? If the voters of Pennsylvania send John Fetterman to Washington, Fetterman promises, ""to push back against work to work."" No more ""work to work."" You can hear a man in the audience cheering, as Fetterman says that. That man gets it. He knows how badly we need to fight the hidden epidemic of work to work. This work to work pipeline is literally killing people and John Fetterman will put an end to it. No more work to work. 

So, there's that, the anti work to work platform, whatever that might be. The other thing that Democrats are running on, the thing with the thing they believe we need a lot more of is of course, abortion, and you can see why. 

As Yahoo! News dutifully reported the other day, ""America is facing a diaper crisis and the anti-abortion movement may not be helping."" So really what you have here is a classic demand side approach to the ongoing diaper and formula shortages. Just don't have kids, dumbo, and then you won't need diapers. You also won't need a house or a car or a raise or extra food or money for college tuition. It's pretty simple. 

When you get to this point and this point is a place where the economy is so completely distorted that only Democratic donors can still afford to have normal families, when you get there the solution is simple: don't reproduce. Childlessness is the cure for the economy they created and that's why abortion is so very important especially now. 

It's so important the Democrats say they want to eliminate the filibuster to bring back more abortion. Once again, here's John Fetterman:

Yeah. Now we're in November or whatever the election is. Let's be completely honest, there is no chance that guy is going to win and of course, Pennsylvania is a purple state and of course, he's running against a guy who's been attacked a lot, Dr. Oz. Of course, he has the backing of every Democrat up and down the chain in Washington, but let's be real. That guy in the U.S. Senate? Refuse to believe it. But it's not just Fetterman. Every Democrat is now talking like this, even ones who technically identify as women. They're not just John Fetterwomen. They're actual identified as women, women, whatever that means now. 

At the White House today.  said that abortion restrictions, which apparently are not relevant to her, but she still cares a lot, are ""not just disturbing, but also dangerous."" To whom you wonder? She didn't get specific on that. 

And then in Arizona, Katie Hobbs, who is running for office there against Kari Lake, just went on CNN to announce that not only is she pro-choice, she will not support any restriction on abortion ever, anywhere, under any circumstances. Here she is:

If Katie Hobbs loses (It looks like she's going to. Praise God), you hope for her sake that she'll spend a little bit of time asking herself, maybe in seclusion, ""How did I get here? How did someone like me, with no obvious skills, unable to speak or think, how did I wind up running for the highest office in the state of Arizona? Maybe I should've done something else in my life."" In the meantime, you have to kind of marvel at how out-of-touch people like this are.  

If you listen to unhappy middle-aged liberals like Katie Hobbes, you would think that hundreds of millions of Americans are lying awake at night, night after night, terrified they might not be able to get that federally subsidized late-term sex selective abortion they've been dreaming about. They want it, but they can't have it. Potentially, maybe in Mississippi, if they were to go there and get pregnant, which they won't, but whatever. It's what's wrong and that's clearly Katie Hobbs' main fear, but it's definitely not the concern of most people and we know this for a fact. 

The latest New York Times poll, probably not slanted to the right, finds that only 5% of Americans list abortion as their top priority. Keep in mind, that's both pro and con, both pro-choice and pro-life, just 5%, so whatever you think of Roe v. Wade being overturned politically, this is not a powerful issue, actually. It's a boutique issue. If democracy were functioning as a democracy is supposed to function where the people, the broad bulk of people have a voice in government (In fact, they're supposed to control government. 

Most people aren't that interested and Democrats know that.) they have pollsters, too, but because abortion is all their donors care about, they can't stop talking about it. It tells you a lot. No wonder Katie Hobbs is refusing to debate her opponent Kari Lake. 

Can you imagine getting up on stage and saying ""This is a decision, this is a medical decision between a patient and her doctor."" To which Kari Lake might say ""like a vaccine? Your body, your choice? How does that work? It's not actually your body or your choice. You only told us that, Katie Hobbs. It's the politician's choice what goes into your body or what comes out.""

But we're never going to see that because she refuses to debate. This is the Democrats platform, January 6 and abortions. That's what they're running on, sort of.

But actually, the real thing they're running on their main platform is fantasy, denial. None of the problems you may have noticed (and it's hard to ignore them or not see them) but none of them in Biden's America are real. There's no recession. It's not a recession. That's racist. Stop saying that. There's no fentanyl crisis, at least not in Ukraine, where it matters. How many Ukrainians are dying of fentanyl? Not many. OK, no problem and to the extent there actually are problems in this country, the United States of America, Republicans did it. 

Robert Reich at one point was a high government official. High may be a weird way to describe him, but he served in the Clinton administration, was reputed to be a smart guy. Robert Reich just wrote a long piece explaining that rising crime is actually the fault of the Republican Party because guns. ""Rising crime rates are due to the proliferation of guns."" OK, why is it that the states with the lowest crime rates also have the highest gun ownership rates? Hmm. No one believes this. Not a single person believes this. 

If you're trying to tell voters that QAnon somehow defunded the police, they're not going to buy it and in fact, people are tired of being lied to at this level. It's too obvious. They know crime is real. They're afraid of it, and they know exactly why it's spiked under Joe Biden because they defunded the police, they intimidated police who were still serving into not enforcing the law. And in every possible case, they sided with the criminal—the antisocial, anti-human savages who are murdering people, push them in front of subway trains. 

""They have rights!"" Really? What about the rights of the person pushed in front of the subway train?  Right? Got it. People aren't buying this anymore. No one's buying it and that's why Lee Zeldin, congressman from Suffolk County, New York, has apparently caught up to Kathy Hochul, the unelected governor of New York. Why is Lee Zeldin doing so well? It's not just his sparkling personality. It's because he's running ads like this one:

What's the answer to that? What that it's not real? Those are crisis actors? No. The answer is But people who do notice it and say so out loud are doing very well. J.D. Vance in Ohio is one of them. He is the fortunate running against Tim Ryan, the congressman from Youngstown, who in 2019 called for ending cash bail not just in Ohio, but nationwide. Watch. 

 Keep in mind, Ryan was supposed to be the new kind of Democrat, which is to say the old kind of Democrat, the workingman's Democrat who understood that you have to have a functioning society or else you can't continue. But if you actually listen to him, he's just another cringing NPR liberal like the rest of them, advocating for bail reform. Really? We know how that ends. It's been the single most deadly social experiment we have seen in decades. 

In New York, lawmakers enacted bail reform in 2019 and as a result of that, judges can no longer consider the danger posed by suspects when deciding whether to keep them in jail. Really? You can't consider the danger they will pose to the public? Isn't that the whole point? Not anymore. 

So, when the bail reform law took effect in New York in 2020, police in New York arrested thousands more violent criminals who already had active open cases against, in other words, people who should have been locked up and would have been under the old system.

But they weren't because of bail reform.  They were out terrorizing and murdering new people and the numbers show it. Major crimes are up nearly 40% this year in New York, 40% in one year. So, that's a complete disaster and it hurts, as always, the weakest among us, but instead of acknowledging that, much as addressing it, Democrats in the media are telling you, if you notice it, you're the criminal. Watch. 

You really hope that November 8 is the beginning of the end of the hegemony of the tiny brained, cringing liberal, the lifestyle liberals who really wreck this country, the people you just saw on MSNBC. You hope that their reign is over because you've done so much damage and their hypocrisy is impossible to miss. These are the ones who cheered as the beleaguered residents of Martha's Vineyard deported 50 illegal aliens to a military base.  Now they're telling you that you're the one who's afraid of migrants in your community because you're a racist. The shamelessness goes right to the top. Of course, it does. Here's Joe Biden on Saturday:

 Really? Have you looked at markets? It's not just tycoons who care. That's where your retirement account is. It's way down and by the way, day to day, you notice inflation. We have record inflation. We can go on about it. We have many times, but you already know they're telling you, yes, we have inflation because it's kind of hard to deny their own fate cook numbers reflect it. What they're telling you for now is that Republicans are responsible for it. They did this.  

Remember the Inflation Reduction Act? So much for that. Joe Biden is now saying, we're quoting, ""If Republicans in Congress get their way, prices will go up and inflation will get worse. It's that simple.""

Really? Tell us how that works. It's unbelievable. It really is. It's like eating the cookies right in front of you.. It's sick, actually. 

So, they're telling you that if you vote Republican, you're going to get a lot more of the things that you don't like that they created. By the way, if you don't vote for Democrats, border security will actually get worse, too, but for now, it's not a crisis. Relax, racists. There are no drugs or criminals or terrorists coming over the border from Mexico. This isn't some intentional attempt to change the population of the United States even though Democrats have said so many times on camera. Watch.  

There was tiny Dick Durbin admitting that by design, America's population is changing faster than in any country in history, and you are required to conclude that is a great thing. You must celebrate it and if you don't, you're evil but you also can acknowledge it's happening. In other words, it's not real and it's a very good thing that it is. So, if it's not real, who are these people coming into the United States? Well, according to CNN, 99% of them are law-abiding. Watch Kari Lake, who's running for governor of Arizona, respond to that. 

Well, exactly, because that was the master class right there for all Republican candidates. Never agree to the premise of a biased question. Well, it just so happens that 99% of these people are totally law abiding, but on to the next. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. That's not true, actually and the point is, we can't know if it's true because we don't know who all these people are. That's the key point. That's what Kari Lake said. According to the Biden administration's own estimates, nearly a million illegal migrants managed to evade detection and sneak into the country since the beginning of fiscal year 2021. So, how many of those have preexisting criminal records? 

We know they're using all fake documents here in the United States, the one you'll get arrested for if you dare to use. We also know that they broke federal law by definition, by sneaking into our country without permission. So, to avoid that problem, the CNN anchor focuses on the number of migrants encountered, but a lot of those migrants are criminals, too. They are again breaking federal law with fraudulent asylum claims, but you're not allowed to notice that.  

The good news is a lot of people are noticing that. This is all a lie. It's a tissue of lies, and it's coming apart. Now, the Republican Party in Washington, we hate to tell you this, is lame as it's ever been. It's controlled opposition, obviously. but the good news is voters are genuinely sick of it and that's why Kari Lake in Arizona and Blake Masters also in Arizona, will likely win and why Adam Laxalt will likely win in Nevada. And it's why you're seeing conservatives surge in places that Biden won easily just two years ago. That would include the fifth Congressional District, Connecticut. We're going to talk to a Republican running there in a minute and would include the state of Michigan. 

Tudor Dixon is running for governor of that state. She has closed the gap with perhaps the worst governor in the United States Gretchen Whitmer. Here is Tudor Dixon's message. 

  

So, to Tudor Dixon, as we just told you, is running for governor in Michigan. In a normal year, you'd have to say, ""Well, Michigan is a union-dominated Democratic state. It elected Gretchen Whitmer.

750	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-elon-musk-committing-unforgivable-sin-left	2022-10-18 22:47:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Elon Musk is committing this unforgivable sin to the left | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson explains why freedom of speech is essential in society and reacts to the hysteria surrounding Elon Musk's Twitter bid on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here's a thought experiment for you. If you wanted to turn a free country into a dictatorship, not that anyone would want to do that, but let's say you did want to do that, how would you do it? What's the first freedom you would curtail?  

Hmm. Well, it turns out the founders of this country thought very deeply about that question. They were making a new country, and they wanted to avoid dictatorship. They concluded that it wasn't even close. The freedom that matters is the freedom to speak your mind, the freedom of speech. That's the most basic and essential of all the freedoms, and that's why it's enshrined in the very First Amendment to the Bill of Rights. 

It's central not simply to freedom, but to humanity. It's not opposable thumbs that separate us from the animals. It's words. We can speak. That's our power — words. ""In the beginning was the Word,"" declares John at the opening of the fourth gospel. The word. The word is the most important thing that we have. Take away our ability to choose our own words, and we are no longer fully human. We are subjects. We're chattel.  

Authoritarians understand this above all. That's why they hate freedom of speech. In fact, if you gave them a choice, they'd let you have a fully automatic, 50 caliber machine gun before they allowed you to say exactly what you want. With the gun, you might be able to kill people, but with words, you can expose them.  

With words, you can change the world. In fact, there has never been a change, a deep change to the way people live and think, that didn't begin with words. Not with might, not with violence, but with words. That's why they're so obsessively focused on what you can say, on the words you can use, because they understand the power of words. 

And Elon Musk, whatever his faults may be, understands this too and that's why he's trying to buy Twitter, not because he needs another company. No.  is more than just a potential change to the media landscape. It is a true existential threat to the hegemony of the people currently in charge.  

Allowing freedom of speech means the possibility of a revolution from below against the forces destroying this country and the West. Everything rides on this. They know it. You may not, but they do. So, they've got to do everything they can to destroy Elon Musk, who was just the other day, a hero to them. He's the electric car guy, remember? They don't even mention his electric cars anymore because he's doing the one thing you're not allowed to do, which is giving voice to people.  

Since April, they've been trying to destroy Elon Musk. First, they called him a racist. Well, it turns out he was too rich to care. They moved on to new tactics so that NGOs funded by George Soros commanded companies to pull their ad money away from Twitter.  Then some Saudi prince tried to argue that Elon Musk was somehow underpaying for Twitter when it's very obvious, look at the markets, that he's overpaying and then the Washington Post's Max Boot got involved because this was another war he could support. 

In order to save democracy, Max Boot informed us, we need more content moderation on Twitter. No free speech allowed. Of course, content moderation is a euphemism for ""censorship"" and who does censorship help? Always and everywhere, the powerful. Who does it hurt? The weak. Words are all they have. Take their ability to say what they think away from them, and they have no power at all.  

Tonight, after roughly six months of watching this drama, which has gone in and out of the news cycle, it looks like they have failed to stop Elon Musk from buying Twitter. All indications that we have as of right now are that the deal will go through. Twitter is just locked its employee stocks and that indicates some kind of transaction is imminent, and then a source tells the show that there is a very high probability, 90% probability, that within the next two weeks, Elon Musk will own Twitter. And he has said repeatedly and we can't guess the future, but he has said he is doing this in order to give voice to people who have no voice.  

All of us have forgotten that Twitter banned a sitting president of the United States from speaking, thereby making it really clear who's got the real power. No, not the U.S. government. Transnational corporations like Twitter, which control speech.  

They did everything they could to stop this from happening, but they failed, so now they're attempting to destroy  the man and again, to be clear, we don't know Elon Musk. We're not carrying water for Elon Musk. He may have weird agendas we don't know about, but it's only about speech. That's it. And that's why the Justice Department is now investigating Elon Musk for reasons that no one can explain, but that's what the DOJ does now, tries to terrify people with criminal investigations into obeying.  

Then David Frum naturally got involved because there's no level to which he will not stoop in defense of the people in charge, and he is now calling for the Biden administration to seize Elon Musk's satellites, the ones that he's given for free to the government of Ukraine for use in their war effort against Russia. 

""The U.S. should have a plan ready to nationalize  (the satellite company) fast, if Musk cuts off Ukraine's connections to advance his political agenda,"" wrote David Frum. His political agenda? In other words, if you don't like his politics, just seize his stuff. And of course, at the core of his politics, all that matters is the call for ordinary Americans to be able to say what they really think. Just take his stuff by force. CNN, meanwhile, is calling Musk an agent of Russia because he will continue to provide access to his satellites to Ukraine free of charge. Watch.  

OK, says the guy with his eyes too close together. Oh, really? It's about Russia and Ukraine. It has nothing to do with Russia and Ukraine. You think they care about Russia and Ukraine? Of course not. If they did, they would be pushing a peace deal to save Russian and Ukrainian lives. They don't care. It's about domestic politics. It's about the United States and Elon Musk committing the one unforgivable sin, which is trying to allow you to say what you really think about the people in charge to make the contest a little less asymmetrical, to give you a little power and they're terrified that he will succeed. 

What we're seeing is the desperation of a regime, not just a political regime, but a cultural regime, a class of people running the country who feel like they are losing power, and they're panicked. You can feel it in their hysteria. The hectoring lifestyle, liberals, the one who work to crush the American spirit, freedom and independence of mind, masculinity, those people, the ones who've been yelling at you on television for the past five years, feel like, ""Holy smokes, it's all slipping away. If the proles get to talk, we're in deep trouble. Ready the helicopters from the roof of the embassy. We got to get out of here,"" but it's interesting. 

Unlike previous regimes, these are not people in uniforms. These are chirpy, middle-aged women who are telling you, you better obey for your own good. Brandy Zadrozny of NBC News, for example, we showed a clip of her the other day talking in her singsong voice about how we're going to need a lot more censorship in this country and yeah, just for your own good. 

Okay. This is the face of soul-crushing fascist liberalism. This is not what we've had before. This is what we have now and people like Brandy Zadrozny are its stormtroopers. She literally wrote a guide for how to reveal where people live, how to dox them if they are guilty of wrongthink. This is a person who targets anonymous posters online if they disagree with he, and then sits back and watches what happens. In a lot of cases, their lives are destroyed and for that, for that service, that dutiful service to the people in charge, corporate media celebrates her as a hero. They have her on constantly to call for even (can you guess?) even more censorship.  

Oh, there are people out there who don't want to lose their jobs. They want to fly an airplane, but they can't for their own good. 

The problem for people like Brandy and the literally hundreds of people just like her in corporate media, all of whom wake up every morning trying to figure out how to serve power as efficiently as they can is that no one believes them anymore. No one takes them seriously anymore. They've been caught lying one too many times so people really no longer care if they're called names.  

Yeah, okay. I don't care what you say. You're totally discredited. You're a joke and that suggests that there is a change coming. We may have a country very soon where people can say what they actually think and when they do that, they will be able to live with dignity again, like free people and you're seeing indications of this. You're seeing people run for office who will not be controlled by unfair, in fact, ludicrous attacks from their opponents. They've unshackled themselves. They've taken off the leash.  

JD Vance is one of them. He's running for Senate in Ohio. He's running against a guy called Tim Ryan. Tim Ryan is worried he's going to lose. In fact, he is going to lose. We're going to celebrate when he does, but Tim Ryan just said 

Watch how JD Vance responded last night from the Ohio Senate debate. 

Yeah, we're sick of it. And it's not just JD Vance who's sick of it. It's virtually every normal person who lives here, of all colors and all political backgrounds. Just sick of it.

 ""Shut up!"" they explain. No, we're not going to shut up. How's that? We're going to keep talking.

751	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-open-race-hate-forms-much-msnbcs-substance	2022-10-20 01:27:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Open race hate forms much of MSNBC's substance | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out MSNBC for broadcasting open race hate on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

In July of 1993, a radio station in Kigali, Rwanda, began openly attacking one of the country's main ethnic groups, the Tutsis. The radio station was called RTLM, but many remember it as simply Hutu Radio because its audience was primarily Hutu. According to Hutu radio, Tutsi people were responsible for virtually every bad thing that ever happened in Rwanda. Tutsis had way too much money. They had way too much power. Tutsis were way too privileged. They were greedy. They were bigoted. They were racists. They were dangerous. Everything about Tutsiness was repulsive.  

For the most part, actual Tutsis in Rwanda ignored all of this. Hutu Radio was not aimed at them, but then in July of 1994, just nine months after RTLM went on the air, a genocide began in Rwanda. More than half a million Tutsis were murdered, in many cases by Hutus whose rage had been stoked to violence by RTLM's broadcasts. 

Entire Tutsi families were dragged from their homes and hacked to death with machetes. Hundreds of thousands of women were raped. The world watched in horror as it happened but did nothing to intervene. Instead, our leaders told us at the time, the genocide in Rwanda would live forever as a lesson to the rest of us about the capacity for evil that lurks inside every human heart and the dangers of reducing our neighbors to the sum total of their ethnicity. They're individuals, not ethnic groups.

Bill Clinton gave an eloquent speech actually on the subject in Kigali back in 1998. Look it up and ask yourself as you read it, if any Democratic Party official could today say those same words.  

It's hard to imagine, given what plays on a loop on that party's cable news arm, MSNBC. Have you watched MSNBC lately? Likely you haven't. Like the Tutsis, you're not the target audience, but you should tune in sometime. It's remarkable. Given that opposing racism is America's national religion, it may surprise you to learn that open race hate forms much of the substance of that channel's programing and when we say race hate, we're not referring to the subtle coded variety. You want border security? You're giving your kids piano lessons? You like Shakespeare? You believe it in the SAT? You must be a racist. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the kind of race hate you cannot mistake for anything else. The kind of people just come out and announce, ""I hate this race of people and here's why I do."" 

It's hard to believe that anything like that is happening right now on American television, but it is out in the open and the most amazing and the most creepy part of all is that no one is saying anything about it. It's all but ignored, and honestly, we had no idea it was going on either until we started getting texts from people, ""Are you watching this? Can you believe this?"" So, we tuned in. 

Apparently on the left, what you're about to see is considered completely normal, even good and that should worry you deeply. You don't want to live in Rwanda, but in MSNBC, they're already there. Now, you probably knew about  who's been fixated on race hate for years now, but MSNBC has a new host, someone called Tiffany Cross, who hosts a show called ""The Cross Connection."" Here's a selection.  

 I don't think it's our responsibility to be tasked with destroying and dismantling the racial oppression that's against us. That's just saying we're more at fault than the White people who constructed this system and the White people who continue to practice institutional racism. 

  

 In fact, as you just heard  say, White people are a mortal danger to you and your loved ones. They threaten your life. Are they poisoning the wells? Are they baking bread with the blood of your children? If not, according to Tiffany Cross and MSNBC, They've certainly done worse.  

This is Hutu Radio, but it's not an independent radio station in an African country. It's part of one of the biggest news organizations in the world, part of the biggest telecommunications company in the United States, Comcast, which owns it. So, you have to ask yourself, what does Comcast’s board think of this? Comcast’s board is mostly White people. White people who, according to the channel they own, decided they wanted something, then they annexed it – White people who steal because they're White, White people who could ""turn to violence"" when they don't get their way. White people are going crazy, endangering their communities.  

So, you have to ask yourself, why are they putting this on the air? Why are they allowing this? This is not a policy debate. These are open attacks on people, on Americans, on the basis purely of their race and that's just a selection. We could go on and on and on. 

Are they aware that this is happening? Perhaps they're not. We weren't, to be fair, but it is happening day after day, after day, after day and at a certain point, you have to ask yourself, if it continues and nobody stops it, do they agree with it? Maybe they do and just in case you think that we are taking Tiffany Cross out of context and pulling the worst quotes from am out-of-context segment to make her seem crazy and racist, here's more. Here's Tiffany Cross on MSNBC:

It's not just Whites, it's White women. Their women are bad, too. Women, of course, are the key to reproducing the White race, which is clearly a threat, as she says again and again to you and your family. 

Now, don't be fooled by the fact that Tiffany Cross can barely speak a coherent sentence. She was a communications major, apparently, according to the internet. That didn't work. But the gist of it is very, very clear. White women are dangerous because White people are dangerous. They are, by the nature of their DNA, potential domestic terrorists. 

Now, you can play the game, well, if any other group were spoken about this way, this would be shut down immediately and of course, that's completely true. There is no other group in America you could talk about the way that Tiffany Cross and Joy Reid and other anchors and MSNBC talk about White people. But you even have to play that game. It doesn't matter what the color is. It's always wrong to reduce people to the color of their skin, to their melanin content, to their DNA, and it's even worse to attack them on the basis of that. And in fact, it's the basis of violence, actual violence, actual violence, but Tiffany Cross can't be criticized because she's oppressed. That's the key. Watch this. 

OK, once again, calling out a specific race by name. Now you have to wonder what the other anchors on MSNBC, some of whom are that race, do they know this? Do they know what's happening on their channel? Are they OK with this? What do you think happens if we continue to talk this way? You may not watch that channel, but some people do. What does this look like in a year or five years or ten years? What kind of country do you live in? Well, a country at war with itself, a race war.

This woman, Tiffany Cross, whose clips you've been watching, is so deranged by a racialist worldview that she believes all people of one color are oppressed by all people of another color. And to prove it, she says, even NFL players, some of the richest people in our society, some of the most celebrated, the most famous, the most privileged, even they can't escape the all-pervasive hatred of diabolical Whites. Watch this.  

The average salary for an NFL player is more than $2 million a year. 60% of NFL players are African-Americans in some positions like cornerback, virtually all the first-string players are Black. We don't have a problem with that. Most people don't have a problem with that. But if you look at that picture and say this is White supremacy, what are you really saying? You're saying that anybody involved in the sport who is White defiles the sport because Whiteness is itself inherently corrupting. White people are so evil that their mere presence in a sport that is overwhelmingly African-American and from which African-American individuals are benefiting is enough to destroy the whole operation because there are Whites involved. 

What kind of talk is that? Well, it's genocidal talk, actually. Not an overstatement. That's exactly what it is. Again, you have to wonder, what does Comcast’s board think of this? It's not a rhetorical question, really, now that we're talking about sports, because Comcast also owns an NHL team, a hockey team, the Philadelphia Fliers and maybe not surprisingly, the NHL just published its first ever diversity report and according to that report, we have a huge problem with hockey and the problem is there are too many White people in hockey. 

Now, why is that a problem?  No one actually explains. It doesn't need to be explained because it's just prima facia obvious. We’ve got a lot of White people. That's inherently bad because White people are inherently bad. Again, do you want to live in a country where powerful people talk this way? What do you think it looks like in five years? The head of the NHL's ""Social Impact Division"" said, ""We have a lot of work to do."" 

Again, how does Comcast's board feel about this? Will the board undergo some kind of forced diversification? What about the NBA and the NFL? We're not following all of this, but as Joy Reid and Tiffany Cross tell us, that's probably because we're White and too stupid to understand.  

  

We could go on and on. We could read excerpts from Tiffany Cross' book, which are brimming with racial hostility. We could play you a million clips from Joy Reid, which are exactly the same, filled with open racial hostility, but you get the point and if you don't believe it, just go ahead and tune into MSNBC.

But it's not really about that channel or those hosts. It's about a society that thinks that's OK, where it's not really about diversity. It's about hating other people on the basis of their race. And it's a little bewildering to the rest of us who thought the whole point of out of America was that we're aspiring to a country where we are judged by the content of our character, not the color of our skin.

And all of a sudden, racial reductionists don't simply have the floor and the platform and cable news shows, but have apparently the unquestioning support of the biggest telecommunications company in the . What does that say about the country and its leadership?

752	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-media-done-everything-it-can-minimiz-economy-crime	2022-10-24 22:12:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Media has done everything it can to minimize the economy and crime | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the impact of rising crime on the midterm elections on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The good news stories just keep coming. Here's one of them. When the Supreme Court overturned  this past June (You remember this) Democrats howled in outrage for weeks. Every hour on MSNBC sounded like a plot summary from The Handmaid's Tale.   Liberals seemed genuinely upset and probably most were, but on some level, not very deep beneath the surface, the people who run the Democratic Party weren't upset at all. They were thrilled.  

Here finally was an issue for them to run on in the midterm elections. It was an issue perfectly suited to a party that had nothing else to talk about. Are they going to brag about Joe Biden? I don't think so, so it's going to be abortion. That was the Democratic message for the , the ones that are coming up in just a few days, but there was a problem with the messaging.  

COVID had just ended and people, not being entirely stupid, still remember that this very same Democratic Party, the same people, had forced the entire population to wear paper masks like children and then to take the shot as a condition of going outside. So, women have the right to control their own bodies? They used to tell us that and then they fired thousands of nurses for refusing to submit to an experimental vaccine.  

The phrase ""my body, my choice"" had been, as we say in the news business, overtaken by events. Clearly, Democrats needed a new slogan, a new way to talk about abortion. Unfortunately, nobody could think of one. ""Your body, my choice?"" No, that wouldn't work. It was too real. In the end, liberals just dusted off the same old talking points and pretended like COVID never happened. Watch.  

The midterm election is now less than three weeks away and in the final stretch, I noticed and I don't know if you've noticed, frankly, the gaslighting of women voters. This message says, ""Oh, you don't really care about your right to control your own bodies, dears. It's the economy, stupid."" You've got a media narrative that says that women don't really care about abortion, women don't really mind if the states control their bodies. They don't care about that. They just care about the price of milk.  

Yeah, it would be a shame if states got to control people's bodies, like telling people what to wear on their faces or what drugs they have to be injected with. That'd be like The Handmaid's Tale! Theocracy! Next, they'll be trying to control what you read on social media. Oh, wait. It's all pretty amusing and the good news is that for once, lines this preposterous are not working. Abortion politics is a total fixation of Democratic donors. It's the main thing they care about. Why is that, by the way? It's a religion. It's a child sacrifice cult, but not everyone else feels that way, even Democrats. 

As The Daily Caller just reported, polls show that ""abortion is not a top priority for female voters."" In fact, ""most women support abortion limits that would have been considered unconstitutional under the Roe v. Wade precedent."" 

Oh. So, it looks like yelling about abortion is definitely not going to be enough to keep Democrats in control of the Congress. Are you surprised by that? No, of course not. You live here. How did the highly-paid and admittedly pretty smart strategists who figure out what the issues are in the Democratic Party so misjudge this one? 

Well, they did what a lot of us do. They forgot that not everyone is like them. Not everyone in America is as miserable as they are. In fact, there are still plenty of people in this country, believe it or not, who have happy marriages. There are still people who love their kids and their grandchildren, still people who consider babies a blessing, not just an obstacle to better vacation.  

Now, some of those people, maybe a lot of those people, might still consider themselves ""pro-choice,"" but they're hardly pro-abortion. They don't think abortion is a positive good. It's not. They don't consider it liberation. and they definitely don't see abortion, as Janet Yellen recently claimed, as the answer to our national economic problems. She said that.  

Here's how it works: Janet Yellen gets rich giving speeches to the companies she regulates. That's corruption, but she's never charged. She's still free. In fact, she's the treasury secretary. And you? You get poorer, but we have a solution. You just need to have more abortions. That's what she said. That's the message they're selling and maybe not surprisingly, it doesn't work. That's not what voters want. So, what do voters want? What do they care about? 

Well, if you look at the polls, they care about exactly what you'd expect them to care about, which is the quality of their own lives. They care about the economy and they care about . This is very obvious. You don't even need to look at polling to know it, but every poll shows it with maximum clarity. How does the media respond to this? Well, of course, doing their job. they've done everything possible to minimize both issues, the economy and crime. 

They've told us the economy is not in a recession. No, it's not. One, of course, by every measure, it is very much in a recession. And on crime, they've told you, don'teven talk about it. Only racists worry about crime. Racists! The one thing you don't want to be called. 

How should Republicans respond to that? Well, we have video evidence. Here's Kari Lake, who's running for governor in Arizona, deftly swatting away a reporter's claim that somehow people of color like crime. Watch this. 

 A lot of people of color feel like they’re being targeted.  

A lot of people of color? A lot of people of color? How many people of color have you talked to about that?  

 I mean, if you look at surveys. 

Which surveys? I'm happy to look at those stats because I will tell you this, that I talk to people of color. I talk to all Arizonans. They're all concerned about the crime. Just because their skin isn't the same color as yours, doesn't mean you want your kids to be walking down the street in an unsafe neighborhood. Every Arizonan wants safety and security in their neighborhood. It doesn't matter what your skin color is and if you look at stats, you will look and see that police do not target people of color. That is a lie that's been perpetuated by the left and then spread and disseminated and spread in the media. Check the stats. 

So great! The reporter says, because, of course, being a White liberal, all White liberals know, if they know one thing, that they have a right to speak for ""people of color,"" not to people of color, something they really do, but for, on behalf of people of color. Kari Lake stops at that. All Republicans running for office should watch that video.

but in the end, you don't need to convince people that crime is real because they live here, too. Crime is everywhere.  

In New York, crime on public transit is up more than 40% and not just pickpocketing. Now, this video that we're about to show you is not an aberration necessarily. It just so happens this was caught on tape, but this is exactly the reason that people are afraid to ride the subway. This weekend, a man was pushed onto the tracks. You can guess the motive actually from watching this video, but we know with no warning whatsoever. Here it is.  

Oh, this random attack. There are a lot of random attacks on the Internet you may have noticed. Are they random? Really? The person who did that is not being sought as a hate criminal. You wonder why.

But the point is, those kinds of attacks didn't used to happen. Now they're commonplace enough that you may no longer be shocked by them, but if you live there, you stay off the subway as a result. Crime in Philadelphia is completely out of control. For example, last year, Philadelphia recorded 562 murders.  

That is the highest homicide total since 1960. That happens to be the year the city started tracking homicide data. This year in Philadelphia, crimes like robbery with a gun are up 47%. Now, why is this happening? It's not an accident. None of this is an accident. Crime is rising as a direct result of policies designed to make crime rise and at the same time, any effort by normal people, middle class people, to defend themselves is immediately met with the full ferocity of the state. This is an attempt, of course, to destroy the American middle class. Let's just be honest about it. 

This is crime with a purpose. They don't want to have this conversation, the people who did this, and that's why they attack you personally and morally if you bring it up. In Philadelphia, a lot of these crimes can be traced to one man, Soros-backed D.A. Larry Krasner. He's decided not to charge many robbers with crimes. Arrests and charges for retail theft in Philadelphia have dropped by about 70% over the past four years. In that same period, reports of robberies jumped more than 20%. You see how this works?  

If you stop charging people with certain crimes, they commit more of them. That seems like an obvious observation and again, it's more evidence this is not an accident. Larry Krasner is not an idiot. None of these people are stupid. They're doing this on purpose. They're trying to destroy and why are they doing that? Well, we can't guess as to the motive, but they're definitely doing it.

When asked about this, how does Larry Krasner respond? Watch. 

 Here you have another White liberal deputizing himself to speak for people of color against his political opponents. Have you figured out how this works? Are you getting tired of it yet? 

Voters are getting very tired of this, so tired of it that even some Democrats have started to figure out actually maybe voters don't want to be shot, raped or carjacked and then attacked morally if they don't like it. 

Kathy Hochul, who is in part responsible for the rising crime in New York, is now running last ditch ads promising to fight crime.  

Oh, really, Kathy Hochul, but it's probably too late for her. She's losing to a Republican in New York. Pennsylvania is almost as Democratic as New York is, but the lieutenant governor now running for Senate there, John Fetterman, is also losing for the same reasons, we guess. His challenger is Dr. Mehmet Oz.

What's that sound you hear? Oh, it's the sound of America getting a little better. You can feel it happening. Last night we played you a clip from an unintentionally hilarious MSNBC town hall in which some pompous airhead reporter tries her best to explain to Trump voters why January 6 actually was an insurrection, an insurrection in which only the police had guns inside the Capitol, an insurrection which the police welcomed the insurrectionists inside the building to interact. Quite an insurrection!  

Of course, the insurrection that went nowhere, where the leader was dressed in Viking horns, eating psilocybin mushrooms. So, we thought it was pretty funny what we didn't note though last night was the moment where that airhead reporter claims that a police officer was killed by the mob that day. Now, if you watch television, you've heard that line so many times that you may not even notice when people say it anymore. They've been saying it constantly for nearly two years. 

""Police officers were killed, many of them."" Why are they saying that? It's not true. It's provably a lie. It is in no sense accurate. No police officer was killed by the mob on January 6. Anyone who claims otherwise is always welcome on this show live to explain who exactly was killed. What's an officer's name and how was he killed?  

We don't expect any takers on that offer. So, the question is, why do they keep telling us that? Well, there's a reason. There's always a reason. They're telling us that likely, so we won't ask too many questions the next time we read about yet another January 6 protester going to jail. We'll just think ""Oh, another cop killer getting what he deserves."" That's what they're hoping you will think, and they're hoping that because if you knew the truth, if you knew why they're really going to jail, you'd be very concerned.

And here is the truth: Joe Biden's Justice Department is imprisoning people for having the wrong thoughts, thoughts that we all imagine were constitutionally protected, as all thoughts are, but don't take our word for it. That's just a right-wing talking point on our cable channel. You can read the court filings in January 6 cases over the past year and a half and in virtually every instance, federal prosecutors argue in public that the political views of the defendants, not anything they actually did, not crimes they committed, but instead their personal beliefs, what they think, those beliefs are reason enough to put them behind bars. 

According to Joe Biden's DOJ, for example, Army veteran Jessica Watkins needed to be detained indefinitely because she had, ""extremist and violent views regarding how to address what she believed to be a fraudulent election."" 

Oh, she was an extremist? It's a term they never explain, but that apparently is now a crime.So, we decide what extremist means and then we put you in jail for being one. That's how that works. UCLA student Christian Secor, that was the guy who sat in Mike Pence's chair on January 6, is now in prison, and he should be in prison, explained the 's lawyers, because he had ""extremist beliefs"" and a ""history of adhering to extremist ideology."" Really? Again, you decide what extremist is and then put me in prison for being one.  

In the case of Robert Morss, that was the guy who was busted in possession of a Lego set of the Capitol, the DOJ put it this way: ""It is difficult to fathom a more serious danger to the community"" than someone who tried to .""abort the certification of a lawful and fair election."" It's the one kind of abortion they don't favor, the aborting of a fair and .  

In every case, though, the defendant's real crime was not aborting an election. No. The real crime, and the DOJ says it right in the filings, is denying the outcome of the election. It was believing the wrong thing. It was not believing that a senile man who refused to leave his basement during the campaign somehow got more votes than any president in American history. If you refuse to believe that, you're now a felon. Question the system. and they haul you away. Those are the rules now as hundreds of imprisoned Republicans can personally testify if they could speak. The legal precedent has been established. 

You cannot deny elections and yet, even in the face of the mounting evidence, this is now a very serious felony, there are some extremists who are not deterred. They're continuing to commit the crime of election denial and they're bold enough to do it on video. Here, ladies and gentlemen, is one of them. 

Did you hear that? Right-wing extremists will literally, –  – (Must teach that word at NPR) – literally steal the next election. That's pre-emptive election denial committed by Hillary Clinton herself, but here's the thing. Probably not likely that an FBI SWAT team is going to show up at Hillary Clinton's house when she's in the shower tomorrow morning and in fact, the next time a courthouse is attacked in Portland, Oregon, or a church is torched in downtown Washington, D.C., it's unlikely that a DOJ court filing will cite what Hillary Clinton just said as an extremist ideology that led to violence.  

Why is that? Well, because in the considered opinion of the Democratic Party and the DOJ, it's not election denial when they do it. No, it's just ""election affirming care."" And there's been a lot of election affirming care going around these past few weeks. In Washington in the hometown newspaper owned by Jeff Bezos, the Washington Post, Max Boot just announced that, we're quoting, ""If the current trends hold up, Republicans are likely to take over at least the House and quite possibly the Senate, too, along with many state offices. This is how democracies die, both at home and abroad."" 

In other words, if you vote for the wrong person, that's not democracy, which by the way, unlike dictatorship, does not always come to the conclusion that you favor. That's not democracy. That's the death of democracy. Democracy dies in both darkness and non-liberal election outcomes. Oh. OK. 

New York Magazine isn't waiting around for the next election. Here's their latest dispatch: ""There are already signs of 2020 election deniers refusing to accept their own possible defeat this year"" and that's half true, of course, but New York Magazine isn't talking about Republicans: ""Most observers are primarily worried that Trump's 2020 shenanigans may have served as a dress rehearsal for 2024.""  

Wait, what? So that means you have Democrats two years before the presidential election telling us that that election is going to be rigged, but that's not undermining confidence in elections? That's not an attack on our sacred norms? Not when it happens in New York Magazine or at PBS, which, by the way, you continue to fund with your tax dollars, the channel nobody watches.  

The only people who watch PBS are the ones who are stuck in traction in the attendance, going out for a cigarette and taking the remote. But they're still broadcasting and here's what they're saying, ""Nearly one in three Republican candidates for statewide office support false election claims."" 

Why aren't they in prison and what is the endgame of these dangerous extremists led by Donald Trump? Vanity Fair figured it out. They blew the plan wide open. ""And then there's Donald Trump,"" Vanity Fair reported. ""He hasn't been implicated in any murders (that we know of) nor has he currently trying to kill anyone (Again, that we know of). He is, however, said to be actively plotting to steal the midterm elections and the presidential one after that."" 

Did you hear that? Donald Trump is going to steal the midterm elections and then the presidential election. How is he going to do that? And isn't predicting he's going to do that, isn't that itself a crime? We can't say. We're not Merrick Garland, but we do know how he's going to do it, because Hillary Clinton has been giving that away for years. Donald Trump is going to do that as he always has done it, with help from Vladimir Putin himself. Watch.  

We know the Russians hacked the DNC, hacked my campaign, etc.. Trump knows he's an illegitimate president who got illegitimate foreign powers. 

I do think that he knows that he's an illegitimate president. 

I believe he knows he's an illegitimate president.  

You can run the best campaign. You can even become the nominee and you can have the election stolen from you.  

Stolen from you by Putin? We better have a nuclear war with him. Oh, we're moving toward that. Too bad every Republican leader in Washington is for it. How dumb are these people?

 If you take three steps back, you will note that nothing the January 6 defendants have ever said, even the guy with the Viking horns on acid, nothing they've said is half as crazy as what you just heard Hillary Clinton say. In federal courtrooms, January 6 defendants are being sentenced to prison because they're not exactly sure how it is that Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama did,. Barack Obama, the rock star who is president and yet his vice president was so stupid that even Barack Obama could barely stand to be in the same room as and got 15 million more votes than he did. How did that work? 

How did Joe Biden get more votes than any president in American history? Is that not a fair question? No, it's not. It's a crime to ask and yet no one bats an eye when Hillary Clinton tells us that Putin is literally going to steal the election. How is it that only one side is allowed to deny the results of elections? OK, no one answers that.

 Here's Joe Biden claiming that Democrats don't question election results.  

We do not deny it. Unless, of course, two weeks out from a pivotal midterm election, we get the sense based on polling that we're about to be spanked like the bad little girls we are, at which point we start making excuses and planting the seeds for more election denial, just as we did after Donald Trump won. That's exactly what's going on now.  

Even as they try to destroy the careers and tear down the character of people who ask honest questions about the last election, that would include Ron Johnson, who is the senator from Wisconsin, the Republican, one of the very few Republicans in the entire U.S. Senate who has actually improved every year that he served there as the opposite of the normal progression for Republicans in the Senate, in case you haven't noticed.  

Now, Ron Johnson is running against someone who's legitimately far out. His name is Mandela Barnes. On Twitter, Barnes once rang in the new year by praising—and few politicians do this—by praising Iran's ayatollah because he supports BLM and we're quoting, ""The first tweet of 2015 from @khamenei_ir is #BlackLivesMatter. Let that sink in. May This be a most wonderful year for you and yours,"" Barnes wrote. 

He's got the ayatollah vote. Barnes also wants to abolish ICE, defund the police and end cash bail. That would result in further chaos and the total destruction of American society. It might be worth following up on that. but no, the media in Wisconsin are still talking about Ron Johnson's election denial.  

Here's his hometown newspaper, which no one reads in fairness, attacking him the other day for it: ""Election deceiver, science fabulist, billionaire benefactor. After 12 years, it's time to turn limit Senator Ron Johnson.""  

Again, just to be clear, Democrats are sending people to prison for questioning the last election, trying to prevent people from getting elected in the  for questioning the last election, while at the very same time telling you that the 2016 election was rigged, the midterm will likely be rigged and we know for a fact the 2024 election is not on the level. 

How does this work exactly?

754	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-fetterman-candidacy-tells-dark-democratic-party	2022-10-26 22:26:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Fetterman's candidacy tells us something dark about the Democratic Party | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reveals what was learned from Fetterman-Oz Pennsylvania Senate debate on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Two days before the Democratic  back in May, staffers for the John Fetterman campaign announced that their candidate had tragically suffered a stroke, but no problem. In a written statement purportedly written by John Fetterman himself from the hospital, Fetterman announced that he was absolutely fine. 

""I'm feeling much better,"" the statement read. ""Doctors tell me I didn't suffer any cognitive damage."" The primary continued as planned with Fetterman's name on the ballot and Fetterman won. He became the Democratic nominee and that was the last that most voters heard about John Fetterman's stroke.  

For months, Fetterman remained in semi-seclusion. Then as the campaign progressed and the polls tightened, he began to venture out. He had no choice. And video clips surfaced of Fetterman speaking at rallies in what seemed to be a bizarre and highly disjointed way. Some began to wonder if he'd really suffered ""no cognitive damage"" from his stroke. 

It was at this point that Fetterman’s personal physician, a man called Clifford Chen, who also happened to be a campaign donor to him and other Democrats, rushed forward to bring science to bear on this question. In Clifford Chen's considered opinion as a respected medical professional who works at a major research university, John Fetterman was absolutely fine. Fetterman was ""recovering well"" from his stroke. He had ""no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office."" 

In other words, John Fetterman was as sharp and as healthy as you or me, as anyone in America. In fact, more so, ready for the Senate. Fetterman's wife, who presumably would know, seconded this assessment and attacked anyone who disagreed—so did a group of Democratic officeholders who wrote a piece in the Huffington Post about how their own strokes had only enhanced their public service. For their part, most of the reporters who covered John Fetterman day-to-day worked hard to calm concerns about his health.  

ith? No, they conceded, 

Until last night, that's pretty much where things stood. Some people, mostly Republicans, thought John Fetterman might not be mentally fit to work in the Senate. Others, mostly Democrats, agreed with Clifford Chen, his doctor, that Fetterman was absolutely fine.  

It was a neat partisan split. Then, Fetterman appeared on stage for his first and only debate and settled this question for all time. John Fetterman, it turns out, is not capable of driving a car. He should not be allowed to operate a microwave oven. There is no chance that under any imaginable circumstances, John Fetterman could ""serve in the U.S. Senate."" It's not a close call. Watch. 

What? That was the moment right at the top that you know, this was not a debate like the debates you'd seen before. Most of it is feel pretty scripted and in fact, this debate actually was scripted. John Fetterman had a script. He was reading it, but he was still incapable of following that script. Here, for example, is how Fetterman responded to maybe the most obvious question of the night, one he knew was coming and of course, would have prepared for it. Here's his answer.  

OK, so a lot of conclusions here. The most obvious, why is Clifford Chen still practicing medicine? If you're a physician, are you allowed to lie for partisan reasons? Don't we have enough of that in this country? Should doctors be allowed to do that? He clearly was lying. 

That's not a man who can work with no restrictions in the U.S. Senate. Far from it. And everyone watching, every honest person, would come to that conclusion. We could play you a lot of clips like that, probably seen them already today, but not everyone is an honest person and to prove it, we're going to show you how MSNBC covered this debate the moment it ended. Here is New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister.  

We just keep clips like that around just for future historians to assess what went wrong in America and we wanted the hackiest possible response, the most dishonest assessment ever offered of any public event, and we just played it for you. 

Because we're literally can't control ourselves,ou just heard her say that Fetterman had a strong answer to a question. Talk about patronizing, by the way. Well, we thought we'd go and check what was his answer. You can assess for yourself whether this was ""strong.' Here it is. 

Again, we could fill the hour recapping John Fetterman's sad responses, but it's not really that surprising. Anyone who's been following John Fetterman for the past five months, you knew that he was profoundly cognitively impaired and it turns out he is. So, you learn really not that much new about him. What you learn is that everyone around him, from his doctor to his wife to the media, to the Democratic Party, they're all liars and they all just got caught lying. Then they went on and on and on like this. During Dr. Oz's closing statement, Fetterman began shouting uncontrollably about social security until the moderator hushed him. Really? Look it up.  

The effect over an hour is to make you feel very sad for John Fetterman. This is humiliating. The guy looked exactly like Billy Bob Thornton in the movie ""Slingblade."" He really did. He couldn't even read the canned lines his staff was writing for him. It was pathetic. You do wonder about his wife, as you do about Joe Biden's wife. It seems cruel to do this to a man, even for political power.

But again, it's the media who cover John Fetterman, who should be the most ashamed. They've known the truth for months. With only one exception, that would be NBC reporter Dasha Burns, the media lied to voters about it. We don't know anything about Dasha Burns, but she at least tried to be sort of honest. Here's what she said after meeting John Fetterman. 

Oh, that's not allowed. Here you have a young reporter who clearly doesn't know the rules. No matter what you actually see or experience or report, you can't reveal anything that might hurt the fortunes of the Democratic Party. That might slow down the team. So, clearly Dasha Burns hadn't gotten that memo and for daring to say that, for honestly reporting what she saw, liberals tried to destroy her.  

Rebecca Traister again, of New York Magazine, said Fetterman ""is not at all impaired. He understands everything."" Molly Jong-Fast said she spoke to Fetterman and, ""He understood everything I was saying and he was funny."" Podcast host Kara Swisher—this is like the worst people on social media—wrote this on Twitter, ""Sorry to say, but I talked to @JohnFetterman for over an hour without stop or any aides and this is just nonsense. Maybe this reporter is just bad at small talk."" 

Blame the girl, will you, Kara Swisher? Of course. And then Charlotte Alter of Time Magazine, whatever that is, also interviewed Fetterman recently. She knew perfectly well he is incapacitated. They all did, but Charlotte Alter decided to cover for John Fetterman because supporting a Democratic Party is, of course, her job. In the hours before the debate Charlotte Alter did the bidding, the direct bidding of the Fetterman campaign, by trying to lower expectations. That was their goal, and she worked on their behalf.  

""Fetterman has never been a good debater."" Alter added, ""Everyone will be watching for Fetterman stroke symptoms. I can tell you already what they are. He sometimes says the slightly wrong word or conjugates something the wrong way."" 

Okay. They're not embarrassed. They're caught working for a Democratic Senate campaign and they just shrug it off and keep going. They never slow down. 

Once Fetterman got on stage, it was really kind of no lying about it. He humiliated himself. The usual chorus piped up, not to admit that they were wrong, but to say, yeah, he's demented, but it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter that he's totally incapable of thinking or speaking. Why? Because abortion. Abortion is more important than anything because it's not a child sacrifice cult at all. No, it's not. Don't worry.  

In response to a post stating the obvious, that Fetterman is totally impaired, a lawyer at the Democratic Party's main firm, Perkins Coie, sent this Stalinist tweet, ""His ability to protect a woman's right to choose is not in doubt. This is a harmful tweet. Delete it."" 

""Delete it."" Of course, it's important to note the obvious, Senate Democrats tweeted effectively the same message after the debate. ""Mehmet Oz is a grave threat to woman's right to choose. John Fetterman will fight to protect abortion access nationwide."" That's their response to a guy who is literally incapable of talking.  

What do we learn from this? We learn a couple of things. Obviously, it tells us that abortion is more important than anything else. Abortion is what really matters to the left. And if you doubt that, consider the case of 89-year-old Dianne Feinstein who supposedly represents the country's biggest state in the U.S. Senate. At this point, everyone in Washington knows, Dianne Feinstein isn't representing anyone. She's no longer capable of recognizing old friends and in April, the San Francisco Chronicle, to its credit, ran a story in which former staffers, not political enemies, but registered Democrats who voluntarily worked for Dianne Feinstein, in which these people, her friends, describe Dianne Feinstein's mental decline and said that she was too senile to serve in the Senate.  

In response to that, Nancy Pelosi dismissed their firsthand accounts as ""unconscionable"" and ""ridiculous,"" not just wrong, but immoral. In other words, 

To emphasize that point, yesterday, Kamala Harris went on a tirade not about inflation or housing prices or fentanyl deaths or the border or the looming nuclear war with Russia, but about the thing that matters most to her and all of them, which is . Watch this.  

Oh, it's about freedom and liberty, says the childless middle-aged lady who forced women across the country out of their jobs because they wouldn't take the vaccine that she was pushing on them. Suddenly it's their body, their choice again. Right. Barack Obama cut an ad for John Fetterman just a few days ago. He's not ashamed to do that. His argument? Of course, abortion again. Watch.  

It all goes back to that one issue. It always does. Why is that? We're not exactly sure, but it's hard not to notice that it does. But there's something bigger going on here. Fetterman's candidacy, like Joe Biden's candidacy two years ago, tells us something pretty dark about the Democratic Party. What it tells us is the Democratic Party has such contempt for voters and for democracy itself and so much confidence in its ownership of the media and of Big Tech that it no longer has to try to win your votes. 

Democrats can run Raphael Warnock, an aggressively anti-Christian fake Christian pastor whose wife detailed abuse allegations against him on camera and that's okay. Still good enough for a Senate seat in Georgia because the machine keeps working. It's not about the person. It's about the party. It's not about the individual. It's about the group. And to prove it, they can even run mentally defective candidates who can barely speak, and then only expect them to win, but expect you to accept the outcome no matter how transparently absurd it is. 

On November 9, they'll be telling you that  got 81 million votes in Pennsylvania, and they'll threaten to put you in jail if you don't believe it. Why wouldn't they do that? It worked with Joe Biden.

755	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-thanks-bidens-religious-war-in-ukraine-us-run-out-diesel-fuel	2022-10-27 22:08:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Thanks to Biden's religious war in Ukraine, the US is about to run out of diesel fuel | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on the energy crisis stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

There are a lot of faraway places in this world—Namibia for example— but Europe is not one of them. Europe is where your kids spent junior year abroad. Europe is an easy flight from the east coast of the United States to pretty much anywhere on the continent and you know this. You've been on vacation in Europe, as millions of Americans have. For the most part, they speak English in Europe. They've got Starbucks and Taco Bell and air conditioning and modern hospitals. It is not another world.  

Given how closely related the United States is to Europe and has always been, you would imagine our leaders would notice when Europe began to fall apart, especially when the signs were not subtle at all – and they weren't. This summer, Germans began clear-cutting ancient forests to heat their homes. In Poland, families queued up for hours to buy coal, just like they did 150 years ago. In the U.K., the government projected that more than 10,000 Britons will freeze to death, will die, this winter for lack of heating fuel—freeze to death in England! That is not supposed to happen in a first world country. 

Europe is moving backward at high speed and it's not clear where it will end. The question is: why is this happening? The answer for once is a very simple one: the war in Ukraine. That's why it's happening. A huge percentage of Europe's energy came from . Those imports have now been banned, supposedly to punish Vladimir Putin. What's the result of this punishment? Well, the Russian ruble is now far stronger than it was a year ago. The European economy, meanwhile, is collapsing. Europeans are much poorer than they were when the war in Ukraine started.  

How is that a victory for Europe, the West and democracy? Well, that's a fair question. It's an obvious question, but no one in Washington appears to be asking that question. Instead, the Biden administration is doubling down on the self-destructive mistakes that are destroying the European Union. 

The White House banned Russian oil, natural gas and coal. It was our moral duty. Then at the same time, the Biden administration crushed domestic oil production here by canceling oil and gas leases and then, as if that wasn't enough, the Biden administration sold a piece of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, maybe this country's most important resource, to China. None of this hurt Putin in any way. All of it impoverishes the United States.  

What could possibly be the justification for doing that? We've wondered. Anyone who's paying attention has had to have wondered that. Well, this week, Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, of Bethesda. answered that question. Russia is an orthodox Christian country with traditional social values and for that reason, it must be destroyed, no matter what the cost to us. This is not a conventional war. This is a jihad. Jamie Raskin said that out loud, but many in Washington agree with him in both parties. They would like to see World War Trans immediately. 

What is a jihad going to mean for you? The details are stunning. Thanks to the Biden administration's religious war in Ukraine, this country is about to run out of diesel fuel. According to data from the Energy Information Administration by the Monday of Thanksgiving week, (that's 25 days from now), there will be no more . What's going to happen then? Well, everything will stop. That means trucks and trains and barges all unable to move. 

Farm equipment will shut down. There will be no deliveries because there'll be no trucks. There'll be no diesel generators and then inevitably, our economy will crash because everything runs on diesel fuel—not on solar panels, not on wind farms, on diesel fuel. Diesel is not a negotiable commodity. You have to have diesel.  

What happens when we don't have it? Well, yesterday, Fox's Jacqui Heinrich, apparently alone in the White House press corps, asked the White House spokesman, John Kirby, that very question.  

John Kirby, standing at the podium representing the White House, the president of the United States, the administration, the largest organization in human history, the executive branch of government had no answer. Butdon't worry, he said. We will be exporting plenty of energy to Europe to help fight that progressive crusade in Ukraine. Watch.  

Just pause and savor the irony here just for a moment because now everything is irony. They've been telling you for decades since Al Gore left the White House, that the single greatest threat to the world was warming and because of their efforts to fight warming, you are in danger of freezing and unlike warming, freezing actually kills people, a lot of people every year, and it will kill people in the West this year, thanks to their efforts to fight warming.  

The second thing to notice is the White House spokesman's totally uninterested, blasé response to the most basic question anyone could ask, which is ""What are we doing about the fact we're running out of diesel fuel?"" He has no idea and he's not embarrassed that he has no idea. The problem is at this point, there may not be an answer because there may not be a way to avoid a disaster. Diesel fuel is not just low in this country. It's low in every Western nation that is aligned itself with Ukraine. All these nations preparing for World War Trans are running out of diesel fuel. As New York Magazine has reported, ""The last time there was this little supply (of diesel), there were about 3.5 billion fewer people on the planet."" Well, that puts it into perspective.  

The Biden administration responded, as you know, earlier this year to rising gas prices, which they feared above all, because the midterms are coming in two weeks by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, but that will not work here. The Northeast home heating oil reserve contains a million barrels of diesel in case of emergencies. The problem is that demand is so high across the board that, according to The Washington Post, even if the Biden administration used every single barrel in that stockpile, that stockpile would be empty in less than six hours.

And of course, it's not just diesel that's running out. Jet fuel is up about 23% in just the last month. Kerosene, which if you don't live in New York City, you know perfectly well, is used to heat people's homes and keep them from dying, is now close to $7 a gallon. Who heats with kerosene, by the way? Poor people heat with kerosene, and they're the ones who can't get it. $7 a gallon! In New England, people are worried about freezing to death this winter. Here's a local Fox report. 

This shouldn't be happening in this of all countries. The United States has some of the deepest – by some measures, the deepest – energy reserves on the planet. It's our main strength. Cheap energy is the reason this is a rich country. That's the reason. That's why we're exceptional, because we have cheap energy and this country was energy independent a few years ago.  

Now, if you want to fix the economy, you would make this country energy independent once again. You would bring back cheap energy. That will fix the economy quicker than anything else. That's the only thing that'll fix the economy. But the Biden administration, for whatever reason, has done the opposite — depleting our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for example. They just released another 15 million barrels the other day.  

Because they know that's running out, the White House is also begging foreign governments for help in the most humiliating possible way. Biden just went and begged the Saudis in secret for more oil. As the New York Times reported this week by his top aides, ""thought they had struck a secret deal to boost oil production through the end of the year.""

But then the Saudi royal family decided not to go along with it. They're not ramping up their oil production. They're doing the opposite. Saudi's oil minister is now telling the West to brace for energy shortages. Watch this.  

An energy shortage is not really a debate over whether some dude should be on the girls’ swim team. This is adult stuff. Countries rise and fall on the basis of what energy costs and when there's a real energy shortage, things fall apart. People die. Economies collapse. Poverty sets in, systemic poverty, not just in the bad part of town, but in your part of town. This is a real thing. 

The problem is the people running the government are children. They not only can't admit what they've done wrong, they don't even understand it. Here's Karine Jean-Pierre, the glass ceiling shattering spokeswoman at the White House, addressing the question yesterday.  

This is embarrassing. She can't even conjugate the verb correctly. This is the spokesperson. It's a joke. She's doesn't know what oil is and she's lying. They're all like that. These people are not capable of running a country this big and this complex and that's why it's falling apart. Joe Biden is blaming gas stations for high prices. How's Kamala Harris responding to all of this? Well, she's responding to diesel shortage by telling you diesel is bad. Watch. 

The lady who never had children is lecturing you about children. The person has never had a real job is lecturing you about energy policy. The woman who told you masks would stop COVID is telling you about diesel fumes and their effect on your body. 

This is a joke. The truth is these people are bumping right smack up against reality and here's the reality. We have 25 days to avert economic catastrophe. Catastrophe is what will happen if we run out of diesel fuel. That's more important than prosecuting a jihad in Ukraine. It's more important than World War Trans. 

Everything depends on this, and we've got 25 days to fix it.

756	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lefts-monopoly-twitter-broken	2022-10-28 22:16:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The left's monopoly on Twitter has been broken | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson breaks down the ramifications of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The Babylon Bee is one of the last English language satire sites left on the internet and no, we're not counting The Daily Beast or The Atlantic Magazine—neither of which make people laugh on purpose. The Babylon Bee, by contrast, is intentionally amusing, and it succeeds mostly because it is sharp, and it's honest. This March, the site published a piece with the headline ""The Babylon Bee's Man of the Year is Rachel Levine."" 

The article is funny because it pointed out that Rachel Levine is himself, pretty funny. Here you have a man dressed up like a woman in makeup and purple glasses, wearing some kind of admiral's uniform, pretending to be the assistant secretary of Health when he looks like a candidate for imminent heart attack himself. So, the whole outfit is a riot. It's like a Halloween costume some clever drunk college student dreamed up. ""This year, I'm going as an obese transvestite health admiral.""You’d laugh if you saw him at a party.

But the Biden administration can't allow you to laugh at Rachel Levine or at Karine Jean-Pierre or Kamala Harris or any of the other transparently absurd figures they’re pretending are running our country, or, for that matter, at Biden himself, who somehow they tell you got ""81 million votes"" despite being senile and rarely going outside. 

It's all pretty funny when you think about it, but you can't laugh and you can't laugh because humor is the most subversive thing. Once you start noticing the pure, hilarious ridiculousness of the people in charge, you may be much less likely to obey them. So, it's absolutely vital that somebody wipe that smirk off your face by force if necessary. Twitter immediately banned the Babylon Bee from its site for the crime of making fun of Rachel Levine. 

You've heard that story for other stories like it, but here's what's interesting about this one. , wherever he was at the time, noticed this happening and he was appalled. He wasn't appalled because he's an ideological conservative. Musk is the richest man in the world and he didn't get that way by being a right-wing political activist. He's a business guy. To the extent Musk has politics, they seem to be traditional, civil liberties, oriented liberal...but banning a comedy site for mocking someone in power? That seemed totalitarian to Elon Musk. 

Musk called the head of the Babylon Bee, Seth Dillon, and told him that he ""might need to buy Twitter"" and he wasn't kidding. Yesterday, after months of legal drama, Musk did that. ""The bird is freed,"" he tweeted. Then he fired several of the company's top executives, including its CEO Parag Agrawal. Within hours, he pledged to let people laugh online if they wanted, to let people who've been excluded from our public conversation speak, lifting the ban on the banned commentators on Twitter. That would include, presumably, Donald Trump, the former president; Project Veritas, a group of journalists; Alex Jones and many thousands of others. Then Musk promised to make Twitter's algorithm transparent.  

What is Twitter's algorithm exactly? Well, we don't have any real idea because no one's seen it. We will now. Twitter will no longer be a publicly held company. It will be a privately held company and Musk has said he will show us exactly how it works. Apparently, the algorithm has effectively existed to censor conservatives on the basis of their political views. Now, in one day, people who could not speak will be allowed to speak. The playing field will be transparent, which is a prerequisite for fairness and if you want to laugh on social media, you can.  

It seems like a big day. This seems like good news. And if your job was to defend freedom of the press – and it is the job of journalists to defend freedom of the press because they rely on it – you'd think he'd be pretty excited about this, but they're not excited. Instead, journalists are panicked by this development. Watch.  

It's scary when rich people own media companies, says Donny Deutsch, who inherited a media company from his own rich father, but he doesn't mean it. There's no principle here. No one at MSNBC means it. How do you know that? Because they're not complaining about, say, MSNBC's corporate owners, its billionaire owners at Comcast. They're not upset about the fact that Jeff Bezos, probably the second-richest man in the world, owns the hometown newspaper of the government—The Washington Post. The Washington Post, owned by another billionaire, just published a tweet telling users how they can crush Twitter now that Elon Musk owns it. ""If you do only one thing,"" The Post wrote, ""locked down (your) ad settings on Twitter."" 

The Washington Post's reporters are also panicked that free speech might be back on Twitter. Taylor Lorenz, one of their most famous and thoroughly ridiculous reporters, had a particularly rough night ""It's like the gates of hell opened on the site tonight,"" she wrote. 

""The gates of hell.""People in the media may have noticed, spend their entire lives online. No, the gates of hell will open when we run out of diesel fuel and the airlines don't work and people freeze to death. The gates of hell don't open when people get to say what they want on social media. Sorry. Get some perspective, honey. But none of them have perspective. 

""It is sad,"" responded Frank Shaw who works as the head of communications at Microsoft. Lorenz was upset because she makes her living by defaming people and then harassing them personally, but until last night, Twitter protected her and many journalists like her from any criticism whatsoever. Here is Vijaya Gadde. Gadde was the chief censor at Twitter, the head lawyer, explaining why Twitter bans anyone who mocks journalists because it's dangerous to mock journalists. Watch.  

  

See how this works? When you're a journalist, you can destroy people's lives in this country on behalf of a political party. You can totally crush them, get them fired from their jobs, attack them to the point they literally lose custody of their children, which has happened, is happening now by the way. You can do whatever you want if you're a journalist, but if anyone criticizes you, they have to be shut down because their criticism is violence. In this case, Twitter objected to the phrase ""learn to code."" 

Now, that's a phrase specifically used to mock journalists, because that's what journalists told coal miners to do when they lost their jobs, learn to code, it's not a threat in any way. It's not violence. It's a joke, but until last night, you couldn't say it on Twitter. Of course, you could aim it downward. You can still tell coal miners to learn to code, but you couldn't tell people with power to learn to code. That's the point. When you eliminate , who do you help? The people in charge. Only the powerful benefit from censorship. 

The editor of The Daily Caller, was banned for telling ""The Daily Show"" to ""learn to code."" The propagandists had protection from Twitter. That's the point and they've lost it and blogs like The Verge are very upset. The Verge just published a profanity-laced screed that included this amazing line, ""Most people do not want to participate in a horrible, unmoderated Internet spaces. Also, everyone crying about free speech conveniently ignores that the biggest threat to free speech in America is the f-ing government."" 

Well, that's true, but it's also a lie by omission because in fact, Twitter was acting on behalf of the government. That's the point. We know that thanks to lawsuits filed by Alex Berenson and others we know for a fact that Twitter censored political views at the behest of the White House and also at the behest of Pfizer.  

The biggest company in the world, the biggest government in the world, get together and tell less powerful people they can't talk and that's what the media are defending right now. So, obviously, they don't understand the concept of freedom of speech or why it's important or why Elon Musk bought Twitter. Joe Cirincione, a ""natsec expert"" member on the thoroughly-discredited Council on Foreign Relations, wrote this last night, for example, ""I now approach every Tweet as if it could be my last."" 

Well, the self-dramatization of these people! They're such drama queens. Democratic Party lawyer Marc Elias was hysterical as well, ""I am here until he kicks me off."" The thing is, Marc Elias isn't going to be kicked off Twitter. We don't want him to be, by the way. We think everyone should be able to speak, period, because that's the basis of a free country. When you don't have that, you have totalitarianism and only people who are benefiting from it support it. 

The whole point of the transaction is to make certain that everyone can talk. That's why Elon Musk did this. The point is to stop censoring all people, period. As the popular account, ComfortablySmug, put it ""We're celebrating because we're free to say what we want. That's what they took from us and that's why they're terrified now."" Exactly. The people who've always been able to say whatever they want are upset, not because their right to speech is under threat, because you now have the right to speech and they hate that because now it's more of a fair fight. Restoring free speech is the main reason that Elon Musk fired Parag Agrawal—that would be the head of Twitter, the loathsome head of Twitter, who went on the record in 2020 saying his goal was to block people from saying what they believe to be true. Watch. 

Free speech isn't just a prerequisite for freedom, of course. It's not simply the first right guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. It's our civic religion. It's what America is. Without free speech, it's not America. Period. 

Here you have a guy who comes to America (Clearly, a smart guy does very well here. Good for him. Made like $42 million last year. Great) and within a few years of getting here, decides to overturn our civic religion and nobody says anything about it. Begone! 

Elon Musk, also an immigrant to this country by the way, comes here because he understands that freedom of speech is the whole reason you would want to live here in the first place. 

The thing about Twitter before yesterday was that it was censoring people before you even knew you were censored. This is called shadow-banning, using algorithms to suppress information like the New York Post's accurate reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop. They did a lot of that. Remember?  

That woman and her boss and a lot of other people at Twitter, the enemies of free expression, the enemies of freedom itself, they're all gone walking down the road, taking their lunchboxes. This is a huge deal. It's hard to overstate how transformative this could be. The activist left believed it owned Twitter and the public conversation in this country more broadly. Why do they think that? Because for many years they have owned it. They had a monopoly and that monopoly has been broken.  

Once everyone can talk—rich or powerful, poor or powerless, doesn't matter—when everyone can talk, nothing will ever be the same and the Democratic Party will be forced to defend its positions on their merits. 

Democrats pulled a sitting president off Twitter. Now, apparently, he's running again. How could you possibly defend censoring that candidate, Donald Trump, if you support democracy? Are you really going to argue that a presidential candidate can't talk? They're going to have to argue that. They're going to have to say that in public. What's that conversation going to look like? 

The Biden administration is in trouble because of this. Everything depends for them on censorship—everything! They're going to do everything they can to shut  down again. They're going to do their best to destroy its new owner, and Elon Musk must know that. He's doing it anyway and that's the definition of bravery. People assume always the billionaires can afford to be bold. 

But the opposite is true actually. Look around. How many brave billionaires are there? Not many. Why? Because the more you have, the more you have to lose. There's no such thing as f-you money. There's only f-you poverty and yet the richest man in the world is risking it all to save free speech. Whatever you think of Elon Musk and however this ends, that's a remarkable thing to watch.

757	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-horrific-paul-pelosi-attack-hold-onto-censorship	2022-10-31 23:09:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Democrats will use horrific Paul Pelosi attack to hold onto censorship | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson dissects the media's response to the attack on Paul Pelosi and how Democrats will try to capitalize on it on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.

We've been watching this story all weekend with growing bewilderment. Last Friday morning, as you know, around 2 a.m., police arrived at the home of the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. It's in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. Inside the home, they found Pelosi's 82-year-old husband, Paul, and another man, 40 years younger, called David DePape. Nancy Pelosi was out of town at the time.

In full view of the police,  in the head two times with a hammer. Both Pelosi and DePape were then taken immediately to a local hospital— Pelosi for his head injuries and DePape for reasons that are still not clear. DePape was later charged in federal court with assault and attempted kidnapping. At this point, that's what we can say for certain. David DePape assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer. Apparently, DePape has admitted that in police custody, but beyond those facts, there was much in the story that remains muddy.  

How, for example, did DePape get inside the Pelosi home? That's the first question. Last year, ABC News reported what you already guessed, which is that Pelosi has round the clock protection at her houses. ""She has her own security. She has the Capitol Police. They fly all the way out here from Washington, D.C. with her."" And yet in this case, San Francisco D.A. Brooke Jenkins says that there was no security present at the Pelosi home on Friday night. And that's pretty strange because according to multiple accounts, even when Pelosi isn't at home, her houses are well-guarded. Again, as you would expect. 

Our friend Harmeet Dhillon told us that when her firm recently tried to serve a lawsuit against Paul Pelosi at various properties he owns, all of them were guarded by ""multiple law enforcement officers on the perimeter."" So how did DePape, get past security that apparently wasn't there? And why wasn't it there if, in fact, it wasn't? We know he got inside and once he was inside, what exactly happened next? Well, accounts of that are changing.  

At the first press conference on Friday, San Francisco police suggested there was a third person in the home when police arrived and Politico dutifully reported that, ""officers arrived at the house, knocked on the front door and were led inside by an unknown person."" In other words, by a person who was not David DePape or Paul Pelosi. Now, Politico never formally corrected this claim. Instead, just two days later, Politico, the same publication, attacked anyone who repeated its own reporting as a crazed conspiracy monger: ""Pro-Trump commentators weighed in online to raise questions about the investigation based on unfounded and false claims. Among those baseless claims that a third person answered the door when police arrived at the Pelosi home."" 

Three separate adjectives, knocking down that idea, but the question remains, was there a third person at the home? We don't know, but it's not crazy to assume there was. Here's how today's charging documents describe the scene inside the house: ""When the door was opened, Pelosi and DePape were both holding a  with one hand and DePape had his other hand holding on to Pelosi's forearm. Pelosi greeted the officers. The officers asked them what was going on. DePape responded, everything was good."" 

It's an awful scene in some ways, but here's the critical clause: ""when the door was opened."" Well, opened by whom? Common sense suggests it probably couldn't have been Pelosi or Pappy who opened it. They were locked in a life-or-death drama, a struggle, over a hammer. The documents filed today assert that Paul Pelosi had never seen David DePape before yet in Pelosi's 911 call he knew DePape's first name and apparently referred to him as a friend. Here's the audio. This is from a dispatcher relaying Paul Pelosi's call. 

What does that mean exactly? Well, again, we don't know, and we can't know. We do know that anyone who has ever met Paul Pelosi can tell you he is an awfully nice man. He's warm, and he's friendly, and he certainly didn't deserve to be hit in the head with a hammer. It's horrifying that he was. But as long as this is a news story with public policy implications, and unfortunately, that's what it's become, it is fair to ask the obvious questions, as you would, about any other violent crime that occurs in America, and especially this one, since so many facts, basic facts seem to be in dispute.  

Local KTVU investigative reporter Evan Sernoffsky, for example, initially reported that DePape was ""found in underwear"" when police arrived. Today, Sernoffsky made a specific point of retracting that claim. ""I'm now told by other sources that DePape was not dressed only in his underwear."" Well, okay, fair enough. We'd be satisfied with either explanation. Not really our business. But you can't blame (and this is the point), you can't blame people watching all of this at home for thinking that maybe there's something weird going on here. Parts of the official account don't seem to make any sense. 

The solution, obviously, is to release the police bodycam footage from last Friday.  That's often done immediately in cases like this, cases that attract heavy public scrutiny. Transparency restores the public's faith in the system. It is the only thing that does. In fact, that's the whole point of body cams, to reassure people that they can really know what happened. Transparency is the antidote to ""misinformation."" On the other hand, if you want people to fall headfirst into crazed conspiracy theories, then you would keep lying and hiding things and yet for some reason, the San Francisco Police Department is refusing to release Friday's body cam video. 

We learned that today when we filed a records request. No chance, they said. So, until we see that tape, there is a lot that we cannot know, but the main question tonight, (one that's going to affect your life going forward because this story will affect your life), the question is, who exactly is David DePape? 

Many in the media seem studiously uninterested. They don't really want to know. At a police press conference last week, a reporter was caught on a hot mic being instructed by someone not to discuss DePape in any great detail. It was left in the end to a journalist who doesn't work for a big media outlet, independent reporter Michael Shellenberger, to fill in some of the blanks. Shellenberger first did the obvious. He went to where DePape was living, across the bay in Berkeley. You're seeing an image of it on your screen right now.  

Apparently, DePape was camping full-time in a dilapidated Ken-Kesey-style school bus, complete with a gay pride flag out front and a sign that reads ""Berkeley Stands Against Hate."" Behind the bus hangs a BLM banner. Politically, this picture could not be clearer. You know where this guy stands.

But Shellenberger and others kept digging. They found that DePape was, in fact, well known in the area, in the entire Bay Area, as a hallucinogenic drug enthusiast and a semiprofessional nudist. He often appeared at nudist theme events. Does David DePape have a prior criminal history? That's an obvious question and perhaps a relevant one. But we can't answer it because, once again, authorities in San Francisco have refused to tell us or anyone else.  

We do know that the people around David DePape believe that he was completely deranged. The ones who knew him best thought that. The San Francisco Chronicle interviewed his ex-girlfriend, who reported that DePape is mentally ill and struggles with drugs. For example, he once thought he was ""Jesus for a year. He's never been able to hold a job,"" said the former girlfriend. ""He has been homeless. This person really does suffer from mental illness and that is probably why he was there at 2 a.m.."" She described him as a ""broken child in an adult body with serious mental problems."" DePape's neighbors, who would know, said more or less the same thing.  

So, just another homeless, mentally ill drug addict with a fondness for BLM. That's not quite so unusual in San Francisco. Oh, and there's one other highly unsurprising thing about David DePape. He's also an illegal alien. Today, Fox's Bill Melugin learned that DePape, who was originally from Canada, has long overstayed his visa, so he is currently in this country illegally. 

So, to restate, the perpetrator in this violent crime against Paul Pelosi is a mentally ill, drug addicted illegal alien nudist who takes hallucinogens and lives in a hippie school bus in Berkeley with a BLM banner and a pride flag out front. Take those uncontested facts and let them rattle around your brain for a moment until a recognizable pattern emerges. What does this sound like to you? If you guessed, this is obviously a textbook case of homegrown right-wing extremism, well, then, obviously, you've been watching a lot of cable news today. Here's a selection: 

This is about election denialism. What has happened over the last two years has seeped into the minds and the thoughts of some unstable people. 

Well, to be fair, the fact that Mika Brzezinski has a high paying job does give rise to conspiracy theories. I mean, in a fair society, how could that happen? But it has.

The bottom line is, ladies and gentlemen, the mentally ill, homeless, illegal alien, drug addict who lives in a painted school bus in Berkeley with the BLM flag is actually, despite all appearances, another member of Donald Trump's QAnon army. As CNN commentator David Axelrod put it, ""far-right conspiracy theories"" are to blame here. And of course, Jen Rubin at The Washington Post accused right wing Republicans of ""inciting violence"" against the Pelosi family using this illegal alien, homeless guy on drugs. ""The far-right demonized Pelosi and that led to the attack,"" read a banner on MSNBC. 

On what grounds, other than political desperation, are they saying things like this? Well, according to some reports, the homeless, mentally ill, drug addicted illegal alien David DePape somehow maintained websites with right wing content on them. One of these sites was apparently called ""friendy-frens-dot-com"" and the strange thing about that website is that the web address for it was registered back in September, but there's content on the site that is backdated to August and internet archiving services didn't register any content from that blog, apparently David DePape's blog, until October 28. That was the day of DePape's attack on Paul Pelosi.  

On October 28, ""friendy-frens-dot-com"" suddenly included a bunch of incoherent posts about UFOs and Peter Navarro. I'm not making that up. Those are the facts. What do they mean? Well, it's a right-wing conspiracy, obviously. Better indict Marjorie Taylor Greene for the crime. 

Keep in mind, as you shake your head in bewilderment at all of this, that the midterm elections are next Tuesday and Democrats are in trouble, and they believe the attack on Paul Pelosi might help them. As Margaret Brennan explained over on CBS, because a mentally ill illegal alien attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband is now immoral to criticize the leader of the Democrats a week before an election. Savor this. 

""Why do you make it about the issues?"" said the lady who spent four years screaming about Donald Trump, the man. It's hilarious and brazen and shameless and the second the midterms are over, they'll stop, but the point is, as always, all the journalists got the same memo and they're all running with the same memo, of course using exactly the same words. Ashley Parker at The Washington Post wrote this, ""In 2022, the GOP spent $40 million vilifying Pelosi in ads and on Friday, her husband was attacked by a hammer."" Do you see the direct correlation? 

If you criticize Nancy Pelosi, obviously you're endangering her family. Of course, she does run the political party that's facing re-election right now, that controls the United States Congress. She's third in line for the presidency. But you can't criticize her because if you do, you're just like your acolyte...DePape.

So the Republican Party clearly needs to stop running advertisements that hurt Democrats ahead of the midterms. Please.  

That's the problem here, not the mentally ill, BLM nudist in Berkeley. That they're really arguing is in the wake of this attack, which is awful against someone who did not deserve it and we want to be clear about that. Paul Pelosi really is a nice guy. Hard to believe, but he is. But in the wake of that, they're telling you unfortunately, you can no longer have free speech. We can't. They're telling you this is an example of ""stochastic terrorism,"" which is a completely meaningless phrase that emerged like a virus out of the university to infect our public discourse or more precisely, to suppress our public discourse. 

Reuters has reported that ""terrorism and extremism experts believe it could be an example of the growing threat of so-called stochastic terrorism in which sometimes unstable individuals are inspired to violence by hate speech."" 

What is hate speech, by the way? All of a sudden, everyone in the media has sort of, without explaining why, agreed that there's this thing called hate speech that's real and probably actionable. They can find a billion-dollar judgment against you if you commit hate speech, but just to remind everyone watching, there's no such thing as hate speech. Hate speech is speech people hate, usually the people in power. The truth is all speech, except speech that encourages people to imminent illegal action, like ""go shoot that guy"", short of that, there's no hate speech. All of it is allowed under the United States' Constitution, which is our final hope.

But what they're telling you is that dissenting in any way from the editorial positions of, say, The Washington Post or The Daily Beast or The Atlantic Magazine, disagreeing with those publications and the consensus they represent isn't simply immoral. No, it's worse than that. It's violence. It gets people killed. That's the stochastic terrorism. When you question, say, COVID protocols or drag queen story hour or the war against Russia, you are effectively smashing an 82-year-old man in the head with a hammer. They're making that argument.

And of course, they have no choice but to make that argument. Democrats are very worried about the coming elections, but they're absolutely terrified that Elon Musk may allow people to criticize them on Twitter and they know Republicans don't seem to know, which is without censorship, the Democratic Party cannot continue to hold power. 

Democrats understand that. They have nothing to offer. They have to stop you from asking questions, so they have to crush Elon Musk, not because he's a right-winger, but because he will allow their opponents to speak. And of course, they are using the attack on poor Paul Pelosi to do just that.  

The New York Times has just come out with a piece that says ""Elon Musk in a Tweet, shares a link from a site known to publish fake news."" Really? What did Elon Musk do? Well, he linked to an article about how Paul Pelosi called the guy in his home a friend. Well, that's what the name on one tape says. You can draw your own conclusions or not, or maybe you don't care, which is also fine. How is that fake? Seems to be real. NBC News is Ben Collins explaining that Musk's tweets are ""how you lose a democracy in the age of the internet."" 

Oh, by asking questions. Jimmy Kimmel attacked Musk personally, used to be a comic, sad to watch that decline. ""It's been interesting,"" Kimmel wrote to Musk, ""to watch you blossom from the electric car guy into a fully formed piece of …"" human excrement. Then CNN told its viewers today that in the wake of the attack on Paul Pelosi, Elon Musk no longer let people speak freely on Twitter. That was his plan, but no more. In the wake of the attack on Pelosi, Musk must retain ""what the far-right calls censorship"" The far-right? 

We don't need to be far-right to identify the censorship, because censorship is exactly what it is and to restate, Democrats could no longer exist or hold power without it. They need censorship, and they're going to try to use this horrifying crime to hold on to it.

But something else is going on here too, something beneath even all of that. Obviously, by immediately politicizing the attacks, Democrats get a lot potentially, but the main thing they do is effectively obscure the deepest truth of all, which is that what happened to Paul Pelosi is not so unusual anymore. Crime in this country is out of control by every measure. Attacks by the mentally ill, homeless, even non nudist who don't live in buses, but the mentally ill homeless are now their own category. They're a feature of life in our cities, in fact, of every part of this country controlled by the Democratic Party. If you live in one of those places, no matter who you vote for, you know that that's true. You're pushed in front of a subway train by one of them. That's entirely real. Here's one recent and especially awful example from California. 

A 54-year-old man and his 22-year-old daughter were just stabbed to death in the parking lot of a Kohl’s in Palmdale by a mentally ill homeless man. Not an unusual story, but a particularly awful one. Here's a local news account: 

To restate with heartfelt sincerity, we couldn't feel worse about what happened to Paul Pelosi. He didn't deserve it. On the other hand, if you're going to be injured in a violent crime in 2022, not so surprising that that crime was committed by a mentally ill homeless man because so many crimes are committed by mentally ill homeless people. A fact that everyone who lives in the city understands perfectly well and the people who are making it possible, the leaders of the Democratic Party, assiduously ignore.

This summer, a nonprofit director in San Francisco, for example, a man called James Spingola asked two homeless men to move away from the steps of a community center. In response, the homeless man violently beat him with a wooden plank and sent him to the hospital. This happened at 11 a.m. in broad daylight. This happens all the time and here's the point. The psycho drug addled zombies who do it are usually released the same day to do it again. Everyone knows that. It's not an accident. It's the result of policy, policies that Nancy Pelosi supports in her own city.

But in this case, the guy did not walk because it happened in Nancy Pelosi's House. So, the guy is still in jail. He's not benefiting from cashless bail. The police got there in 2 minutes in San Francisco. That's four times faster than the average response time in San Francisco. Four times! 

The lesson here couldn't be more obvious and they're screaming is designed to keep you from reaching this conclusion, but here it is, Nancy Pelosi and her party, the Democratic Party – it's not an overstatement to say this – have deliberately created a breakdown in law and order and safety and quality of life in your neighborhood. Yet, they are given special treatment themselves when it happens to them.

So, you can grieve the attack on Paul Pelosi and see it as horrifying because it is and still understand that the response to it would not be extended to you. It's a double standard. It's a two-tiered system of justice. That's completely unacceptable and it's not justice. In fact, it's the opposite. 

The media ought to be saying something about this. This is happening. This crime specifically happened, but so many others have happened because of policies designed to allow them to happen and someone in the press should point that out. ""Hey,  is not the only guy who got attacked by a nut case homeless guy this month,"" but they're not saying that and because they're not saying that Democratic politicians get to skate and not just skate, but to grandstand on Republican violence in ways that any person with a sense of shame would be totally incapable of doing because you'd hate yourself for doing it. But they don't hate themselves. They'll say whatever it takes. 

On the very same day that Barack Obama blamed Republicans for assaulting Paul Pelosi, Obama was campaigning in Wisconsin for Tony Evers. Does that name sound familiar? That's the governor who let homicidal mobs take over the city of Kenosha two years ago for political reasons. Watch this. 

Oh, your speech turns dangerous. Other people are stirring up resentment. Really? No president in American history ever caused, intentionally caused, more racial division, more race hate than Barack Obama did. Of course, it was the key to a second term, obviously. But the solution to something that he did is prohibiting you from saying what you think. Shutting down your constitutionally protected right, your God-given right to say what you think is true is always the solution because they conflate words with violence when it suits them. 

In Georgia last week, Barack Obama said Democrats, the party that defunded the police, the Democratic Party, somehow, he said, bears no responsibility for the rise in violent crime all over the country. In fact, Obama pretended Democrats had not voted to defund the police at all. ""Who actually voted against more resources for the police departments?"" he asked.  

It's like if you say anything maybe it works. Who oversees Baltimore; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis; New York; Seattle and Portland, Oregon? How are those cities doing? Speaking of shamelessness, Kathy Hochul just went to on Al Sharpton's show to claim that the crime wave, the one that you're watching, the one that may have hurt you or killed one of your neighbors, it's all fake, in the statement that is crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever thought.  

That's just a lie, actually. New York is so dangerous that people are leaving. Rents haven't gone down because foreign investors are buying up a lot of the buildings, but people are leaving New York in droves. Of course, but according to Kathy Hochul in a claim that is truly crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever even thought in the shower to himself, Kathy Hochul is telling you that the data are fake. So here you have a city in which, New York City, subway ridership has dropped by 40% over the last two years. 

Now, according to Kathy Hochul it's not because subway riders are being pushed in front of trains. People are being attacked by mentally a whole homeless. No, it's because apparently millions of New Yorkers are watching Fox News. They've been fooled by right-wing propaganda into thinking the subway is dangerous. That's what she's suggesting. 

This is too stupid. This is a lie. Voters know it's a lie and when Democrats get crushed in next week's midterms, it'll be in part because people who live in cities and states run by liberals understand that what happened to Paul Pelosi could very well happen to them, and no one would care.

758	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-affirmative-action-immoral	2022-11-01 22:40:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Affirmative action is immoral | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson weighs in on affirmative action ahead of the upcoming Supreme Court decision on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The promise of a meritocratic society is that the most capable people will rise to the positions of the greatest authority. In a meritocracy, for example, you would hire heart surgeons because they're good at heart surgery, not because of how they look or who their parents are. A meritocracy is the only fair way to run a society, and fairness matters to people, always everywhere. Plus, it works well. Fewer people die on the operating table when you do it that way. 

For generations, this is how American society ran. If you were smart and you worked hard, you could compete on pretty much an equal footing against anyone else in America. They tell you that was never true, but it was true. It was called the ""American Dream."" People moved here from all over the world to partake in that system, but there was a political problem with it. If you've got a meritocratic society, it's pretty hard to play race politics because race plays no role in advancement. Individual initiative is what matters. Group interests are irrelevant in a meritocracy. 

Now, that may sound idyllic to you. It may sound like the kind of country you'd want to live in, but for the Democratic Party, it was a disaster.  How do you get your voters to the polls if they're not racially aggrieved? It's hard. 

At the tail end of the civil rights movement, after all the legislation guaranteeing equality under the law had already been passed, Democrats introduced a new concept. They called it ""."" The idea was to punish or reward Americans based on the color of their skin. Ironically, this was precisely the evil practice that the civil rights movement was designed to abolish. Racial discrimination was unequivocally wrong. That was the whole point of the skirmish on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the March on Washington. 

Oh, but no, said Democrats slyly repainting the slogans on the barn, actually, racial discrimination can be good. It all depends on who's being discriminated against. That was their argument. That is still their argument more than 50 years later, but even now, after all of this time, most people, if you explain it clearly, don't really buy it. 

And of course, they're right. Affirmative action is wrong. It's totally immoral.  

It's completely unfair and now, for the first time in years, the Democratic Party is being forced to defend it in public. The Supreme Court is now considering a case about  at Harvard specifically. Because they understand that their power depends on maintaining the racial spoils system they created, Democrats are defending the indefensible with maximum ferocity. Unfortunately for them, it's not that easy to do.  

Affirmative action is not only the very definition of racism. It's also highly embarrassing in its particulars. The closer you get to it, the more embarrassing it is. When you elevate people on the basis of their appearance, you tend not to get very impressive people. Why would you? Unless you're buying sunscreen, skin tone is a totally irrelevant criterion.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor unwittingly made that point today. 

Sotomayor openly concedes that she got her job because of affirmative action. She was completely and demonstrably unqualified for the position. Obama chose her because of the way she looked. Now, that may sound deranged, but it actually happened. No one disputes it. 

Today we saw the consequences of this. During oral arguments, Sotomayor made a mistake that no first-year law student would ever make. She repeatedly confused the terms ""de facto"" and ""de jure."" Now, if you're a lawyer, that is an inconceivable mistake. It's like your local service station confusing gasoline with diesel fuel. 

It doesn't happen because the terms have entirely different meanings. ""De facto"" means something that's not in the law but happens anyway. ""De jure"" means something that is happening that is sanctioned by the law. See the distinction? Of course, you do, and you're not even a Supreme Court justice. But Sonia Sotomayor doesn't see it. Watch.  

  

We have racial segregation under the law in America? That's what Justice Sonia Sotomayor just said. Why is this woman wearing a robe? Even after Justice Alito corrected her, Sotomayor kept saying it was de jure segregation. She said de jure segregation in 2022. . 

This is the society that affirmative action has created. Sonia Sotomayor doesn't know what ""de jure"" means. Ketanji Brown Jackson can't define what a woman is.  

It's hard to imagine a more damning case against affirmative action than its results, and it's always going to be that way because the color of your skin is irrelevant. And if we don't believe that, then everything falls apart. As the arguments went on, the case against affirmative action somehow got stronger. Watch this exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and a state solicitor general.  

Just to remind you, something you already know, but probably never think about, the U.S. government collects data on people's races. Now, in a society where we're all equal as citizens under the law, why would they do that? That's what the Nazis did. So, we're against keeping track of people on the basis of race, aren't we? And with so much at stake, how do we determine someone's race? How long before we're taking blood tests or measuring the shape of people's heads? It's been done before. It happens in other countries to this day. It's really dark and disgusting. 

The question in that exchange was: What box to the Middle Easterners check? , but of course, everyone knows the answer. If you want to get into a competitive school, the best bet for those Middle Easterners would be to identify as Black. The studies prove it. According to a 2009 study by Princeton sociologists Thomas Espenshade, selective schools currently boost Black applicants to the point that Whites are penalized 310 points on the SAT for being White. Asians are penalized 450 points for being Asian. Talk about systemic racism!  

How is that allowed in this country? Well, good question and if anything, this systemic racism and that's exactly what it is, it's racism at the systemic level, has intensified over the past decade in case you have noticed. In 2020, a trial court found that at Harvard skin color was determinative in admissions for more than half of all admitted African-American applicants and roughly one third of Hispanic applicants. How patronizing, by the way, to them. Look at this chart. It shows the average SAT score for admitted students by race at Harvard from 2000 to 2017. It's almost unbelievable how different the standards are and this is happening, of course, not simply at , not simply other schools, but all over the entire society.  

A few years ago, a senior fellow at AEI called Mark Perry found that Black and Hispanic students were heavily favored for admission into medical schools. Black students who had below average test scores were seven times more likely to be accepted into medical school, compared to White students with similar below average scores and they were nine times more likely when compared to Asian students with similar scores. That's medical school. In the end, you will have bad doctors, not because African-American students make bad doctors, but because the process of picking people on the basis of irrelevant criteria like their skin tone is insane. 

It has nothing to do with medicine at all. In fact, the practice itself discredits the medical schools that engage in it because it's so anti-science. This should make you uneasy, but wait, it gets worse. 

Here's an exchange from today.  asked the solicitor general what the educational benefits of affirmative action might be. Here's the response.  

Racial quotas decrease groupthink and allow for a diversity of viewpoint? Really? You live in a society that is defined by racial quotas. Is there more or less groupthink than there was when you were a kid? Is there a greater or smaller diversity of views than there used to be? It's insane.

But the point is, to Clarence Thomas, it sounded very familiar. ""I've heard similar arguments in favor of segregation, too,"" said Thomas, who grew up under Jim Crow in Georgia. Not surprising, because all racist arguments sound the same, because fundamentally they are the same. . It was wrong then. It's every bit as wrong now. The difference is we no longer acknowledge the victims of it, and most are too ashamed to say a word, but millions of them exist by definition.  

There are people like Kaitlyn Younger, who's a middle-class White girl from Texas with no family connections or special advantages. All she had was hard work and intelligence. She scored a near perfect 1550 on the SAT. Apparently, she hoped the system was fair enough to acknowledge her achievement. She was told, ""Work hard, do the right thing and you'll be rewarded."" 

But she wasn't and we know why. She was turned down from every selective college she applied to because of her skin color. How do you feel about that? How do liberals feel about that? Does anyone really want to live in a country like that?  

Well, if you do, Kristen Clarke does. Clarke runs the so-called Civil Rights Division at DOJ. Clarke didn't get the job because she cares about civil rights. No, she was hired because she opposes civil rights and she has her entire public life. In 2020, (she's also imbalanced), Clarke declared publicly that her political opponents should be killed. In response to a video of people chanting ""Fire Fauci,"" here's what she wrote, head of the Civil Rights Division:

""These people should be publicly identified and named, barred from treatment in any public hospital if and when they fall ill and denied coverage under their insurance."" 

Oh, just genocide them. That was her solution.  

Affirmative action allows lunatics with violent fantasies like Kristen Clarke to ascend to power and they can do that because as they become more powerful, they continue to claim that they are victims, but they're not victims. Kristen Clarke went to private school before she went to college, of course. She's a product of privilege. What's interesting is that even as they tell you the affirmative actions are single most important social policy, you're not allowed to single out any individual person who's benefited from it. 

Oh, it's great, but you can't say you got your job because of it and of course, it's totally not allowed to point out that people like Kristen Clarke are unqualified for the jobs they hold. It's an insult to protected groups, but how are those protected groups doing? Are they benefiting from generations of affirmative action? Oh, no, they're not.  

The kids of doctors are benefiting from affirmative action. We know that. SAT results for Black high school students are still abysmal. No one's helping them. 25% of Asian high schoolers in Michigan, for example, scored above a 1400 last year in the SAT. What percentage of Black kids did? Zero. How are they being helped? Well, they're not being helped again.  

The children of nonprofit executives and doctors and network news anchors and Barack Obama, they're all benefiting, but the people who need it are getting no benefit whatsoever. In fact, they're being completely ignored. This is nonsensical. It's immoral and it's ridiculous and so, not surprisingly, the arguments we're hearing in favor of it today. 

According to Scientific American, for example, science compels a racial spoils system. This is real. ""The Supreme Court could destroy affirmative action in higher education and STEM professional (science) must stand against the White supremacy and scientific racism that fuels arguments against it."" So, you're a White supremacist if you're against racial discrimination.  

Now, in a normal world, you would just dismiss that out of hand because it's deranged. It's the opposite of the truth. You are not a racist for arguing on behalf of a colorblind society. You are a good person arguing against bad people, in fact, argue against racists, but they've inverted that and successfully cowed people into silence. Joe Biden's solicitor general, the former Miss Idaho he hired, argued today that affirmative action is somehow vital for national security too. Watch.  

Does she know anything about the subject? Miss Idaho, do you? Do you? No, she doesn't. 

The U.S. military was the single most impressive institution in American life for generations, precisely because it was meritocratic, because people advanced on the basis of individual effort and not on the basis of group interest. It has been completely corrupted in the most recent generation. and that corruption has accelerated under Joe Biden.  

The result of that? The Army is now dramatically short of its recruitment goal because nobody, no normal person of any color, wants to join a rigged system. That's the truth. They've wrecked the military with this mind poison, which is evil. It was evil when it was practiced in the South 60 years ago, and it's evil now.

759	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democracy-not-ballot-joe-biden	2022-11-03 22:17:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Democracy is not on the ballot, Joe Biden | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to claims from the left that democracy is at stake in the midterm elections on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you're an American, you probably assume there's only one kind of democracy, the kind that you grew up with. That would be the democracy where citizens govern themselves through elected representatives chosen in free and fair elections by secret ballot. In that kind of democracy, you get to elect anyone you want because it's your government. The country belongs to you, its citizens. That's traditional American democracy. It exists to serve you. 

But that's not the only kind of democracy. There's also the Soviet version of democracy. Same word, but very different definition. The Bolsheviks took power in Russia in 1917 by promising a lot more democracy. The country they created, the Soviet Union, became the most oppressive police state in history. Yet it was, you should know, a democracy. That's what they called it. East Germany was a democracy, too, so was North Vietnam, so is Ethiopia under Mengistu, so was Albania under the madman Enver Hoxha. Democracy is all. 

In his very first speech as leader of North Korea in 1946, Kim Il Sung described the total destruction of any opposition to his rule, the killing of his political opponents as ""democratic reforms."" Almost 80 years later, his grandson, Kim Jong Un, continues to run North Korea as a democracy, a Soviet-style democracy.  

Again, they're using a very different definition of the word. In their version of democracy, all decisions are made by a shadowy oligarchy, usually fronted by a strongman. Elections still take place, but the point isn't to find out what the population thinks or wants. The point is to lend an aura of legitimacy to the criminals already in charge. Here's Joseph Stalin himself, bragging about the results of the 1937 Soviet election, in which his party won roughly 99.4% support — 89 million votes to 562,000 votes for the other guys, whoever they were. 

Our elections, Stalin went on to say, are the only really free and really democratic elections in the whole world. At the moment Stalin spokes those words, he was busy murdering more than a million of his own citizens for political crimes in what became known as the Great Purge. Across the ocean here in the U.S., it was clear even at the time what was happening in the Soviet Union. 

Some of Stalin's show trials were public and they were obviously totalitarian, but the American left supported Stalin anyway. That includes some of our country's most famous intellectuals and celebrities and journalists. The New York Times was all in. This turned out to be the version of democracy they supported—Stalin's version. Why are we telling you all this? Well, because you're hearing a lot about democracy lately, so it's important to understand which version they're talking about.  gave a speech about democracy last night. Here's part of what he said. 

""Democracy is on the ballot,"" says Joe Biden. No, Joe Biden. The names of candidates are on the ballot. Democracy is not on the ballot because democracy is not determined by the outcome of an election. Democracy is the election itself. Democracy is the process by which citizens choose how they will be governed according to their own desires. That's their choice. It's not yours, but Joe Biden is telling you the opposite and you should know that. 

He's telling you that unless you arrive at a very specific outcome, the very outcome he commands you to arrive at, the system itself is illegitimate. We control the system. We have a moral right to control the system. Therefore, if we lose control of the system, the system itself can no longer exist. This is a dramatic misreading of what American democracy is. In American democracy, the people who control the system only have a right to control that system to the extent the public grants them that right through voting. What Biden is describing is the Soviet version of democracy where elections exist to ratify the status quo, to bolster the cabal already in power. That's effectively with the Democratic Party is saying out loud.

Now here's Barack Obama. 

Oh, he's slick. But it's hard to believe he really means that. ""I understand that democracy might not seem like a top priority right now,"" said Barack Obama. Really? The opposite is so obviously true. Democracy is very much a top priority for so many Americans this November and that's why you're seeing record turnout in these midterm elections, because voters are using the only power they have, their ballots in our democracy, to punish their reckless and incompetent leaders and replace them with somebody else. 

What you are seeing unmistakably is democracy in action. That would be very obvious to anyone who believes that democracy means representation. But to those who believe that democracy means supporting the Democratic Party, no matter what it does, to those people, this moment has a very different feel. This moment feels like an emergency.  

A rejection of Joe Biden's party, from their perspective, is the end of the system itself and they clearly believe that. They mean it. That's why the Biden administration has spent the last two years destroying the two prerequisites for American democracy. Those would be free speech and the rule of law. It's why they've silenced disobedient reporters. It's why they put their political opponents in jail. It's why FBI agents with automatic rifles dragged Christians from their homes for the crime of praying in abortion clinics. It's why nonviolent protesters remain in jail tonight for daring to walk into what used to be called the ""People's House"" because as far as the Democratic Party is concerned, that house no longer belongs to the people. It belongs to the party, along with the entire U.S. government and the nation itself. 

That's how they think. If you really believe that you had a moral right to govern forever, and they really do believe that, you would see elections very differently. You wouldn't view the loss of a  as the usual healthy rebalancing of American politics. Too far in one direction, swing back toward the other side, the kind of thing that has happened countless times in our U.S. democracy. That's what's supposed to happen, but you wouldn't see that. You can see the loss of your own political power as the loss of everything, as the total destruction of the system itself, the beginning of the dark ages. If you believe that, you might be hysterical and they are. Watch.  

  

: 

 Our democracy is at stake. 

  

Really? It's nonsensical to Americans, most of them, because isn't this democracy, dissatisfied with one thing, we're choosing another? Isn't that our most basic right? No, not according to the people you just saw and keep in mind, those weren't just talking points you heard. The people mouthing those words believe them sincerely, every one of them and they're emotional about it, because if the Democratic Party goes, so do they.  

The party is the only power they have. Once that party has been rejected, they will be nothing but what they already are, sad middle age mediocrities with tragic personal lives and nothing interesting to say. Everything is on the line for them. They can't lose and because they can't lose, they're not getting explicit about ""what if.""

Here's Ron Klain, Joe Biden's all-powerful chief of staff, issuing an explicit threat to anyone who might be thinking of voting the wrong way next Tuesday 

One final warning? One final warning, really? Who do you think you're talking to, Ron Klain? Illiterate villagers? We're Americans. We are free people. You don't get to warn us of anything, much less for the last time. This is your final warning? Yeah. Don't think so. You don't get to say that, Ron Klain.  

You don't get to say anything like that, ever, because this is a democracy, an , not a Soviet democracy. In our system, you don't get to issue orders to the rest of us on the eve of an election. No. You beg for our consent because our consent is the only legitimacy you have. This is our government. It's not yours. You are the servant. We are the boss. Act like it.

760	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-left-demanding-ignore-what-we-see-our-eyes	2022-11-04 22:47:00	TUCKER CARLSON: The left is demanding that we ignore what we can see with our eyes | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts NBC News mysteriously retracting its report on the Paul Pelosi attack and weighs in on lies liberals and Democrats tell as the midterms approach on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

If you tuned into ""The Today Show"" this morning looking for the usual funny cat videos and trans friendly salad recipes, you may have been surprised to find actual news being committed on your screen. In place of the segment you expected to see ""Fit and sexy over 70,"" there was NBC News correspondent Miguel Almaguer letting you know that actually that assault on Paul Pelosi in San Francisco that you read about last week, that story was a whole lot stranger than you ever imagined.  

According to Almaguer, citing several law enforcement sources with direct knowledge, it was Paul Pelosi who opened the door for police when they arrived. Now you'll remember that authorities had previously told us that the intruder, David DePape, had broken into Paul Pelosi's bedroom on the third floor of the house and woken him up. Yet somehow, both Pelosi and DePape were on the ground floor by the time police got there. Moreover, according to Almaguer, Pelosi and DePape had been together in the house for at least half an hour, and yet strangely, they both seemed fine. 

With police present, Almaguer reported Paul Pelosi ""did not immediately declare an emergency or leave his home."" Instead, he ""walked back several feet toward the assailant and away from police."" 

What? Paul Pelosi walked away from the police and toward David DePape? What could possibly explain behavior like that and what were they doing for the 30 minutes before police arrived? Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't want to know. Paul Pelosi's personal life is his business. It's not our business. We've got nothing against the guy. We believe in privacy. But unfortunately for Paul Pelosi, there's an  coming next week and his wife's allies immediately politicized the assault against him.

They tried to tell us that David DePape, a homeless, illegal alien, nudist, drug addict who had a BLM flag hanging near the broken school bus that he lives in, was actually a right-wing hitman inspired by Q, determined to act out the violence of January 6 in Nancy Pelosi's own home. They told us that like we'd believe it. Then the president of the United States went on television and said it again. It's laughably absurd.  Ok, but they said it and they're still saying it. 

Then out of nowhere comes ""The Today Show,"" the head baton twirler in the Democratic Party's media pep squad and completely, probably unintentionally, blows up their lie. After watching Almaguer’s story on ""The Today Show"" this morning, you could only conclude, as Elon Musk put it, ""there's a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye."" You think?

Now we know for a fact that there is more to the story because NBC News has Jeffrey Epsteined the entire thing. NBC deleted Almaguer’s story both from its website and from Twitter. Why do they do that? Well, obviously, they did it because the report was true. There's no question. 

When was the last time you saw someone punished for lying? No one's ever punished for lying. You can lie all you want. What you can't do is tell the truth about something important. That's dangerous. You will be punished if you do that and many are punished in case you haven't noticed. 

So, just for fun, we called over to NBC News today. We wanted to get their explanation for why they censored their own story, but mostly, (if we're being honest) we just wanted to rub their noses in the fact that they're not journalists at all. They're obedient, little throne-sniffing servants to the party in power. 

Predictably, NBC News refused to tell us what was wrong with their own story. But of course, we already knew what was wrong with it. Nancy Pelosi didn't like it. That was the problem. Nancy Pelosi did appreciate the story that NBC News ran entitled ""The GOP has Paul Pelosi's blood on its Hands."" That story remains on the NBC website tonight. It meets their ""standards."" 

What are we watching here? Well, lying, obviously, but not the usual kind of lying. Normal people lie in a very recognizable way. They're human beings. They have consciences. They feel guilty about lying, so they don't go all the way. They shade the truth.  

""Did you eat these cookies?"" you ask your 5-year-old. ""I had one,"" he'll say, looking at you nervously. He's lying, but he's doing it to the minimum extent he feels he has to. But if you ask a sociopath the same question, you'll get a very different answer. ""Did you eat these cookies?’ you'll ask. ""No,"" he will reply, looking straight in the face and smiling faintly. ""You ate them."" That's not shading the truth. That's inverting the truth. It's scary, and you're seeing a lot of it lately.

John Fetterman on ""The View"" today, for example. The one thing everyone knows about John Fetterman is that in May he suffered serious brain damage from a stroke. He can now barely speak. That's true. It's obvious. There's no debate about it. Now, if you live in Pennsylvania, you may vote for John Fetterman on Tuesday anyway, depending upon how attached you are to late term abortion, but no matter how you vote, with or against, you can't argue that John Fetterman, ""looks and sounds great"" because by any measure, he does not at all. But that's exactly what ABC hosts argued today. Watch this. 

  

. Really, ABC Lady, have you had a stroke too? How stupid do you think your audience is? Pretty stupid, apparently. 

This same liar described Fetterman's Senate debate performance, the one you saw as, ""incredibly courageous and brave"" like he was on the bin Laden raid instead of drooling on a stage in Harrisburg. In case you've forgotten what she was referring to, here's what it looked like.  

""Hi. Good night, everybody."" That's not incredibly courageous. It's incredibly cruel. John Fetterman's wife ought to be shunned by decent people for allowing that to happen. She knew her husband's condition. She just wants the power. It's disgusting. And keep in mind, that's how John Fetterman talks with the help of a computer. We got a glimpse of his talking machine today. It's the size of an iron lung. 

Again, just like the question of what Paul Pelosi was doing at 2 in the morning with an illegal alien nudist, we would be just as happy, in fact, very happy to ignore this whole thing. We don't want to talk about John Fetterman's stroke. It's awful. It's depressing. John Fetterman should have dropped out of the race in May with the encouragement of his loving wife, which apparently HE doesn't have. but instead, they're pushing him. The Democratic Party is pushing him to run for the Senate despite his inability to speak and they're doing that because they want power. And for the rest of us, that means we are now required to pretend that the sad, brain damaged guy is actually incredibly brave and impressive.  

In other words, they're demanding that we ignore what we can see with our eyes. That's called the ""big lie"" and four days before the , it's everywhere. Here's Joy Reid of MSNBC telling you that inflation is not real. Now, you may think, you may imagine, that you're paying more for spaghetti and two-by-fours and heating oil. Oh, no. That's the figment of your imagination. In fact, it's a diabolical psy-op engineered by the information warfare division of the Republican Party in Washington. Watch this.  

Someday we're going to a recurring segment called ""Guess Joy Reid’s IQ."" That'll be fun. What they've done, says the Harvard lady,s they've taught people the word ""inflation."" There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. The Republican Party running around teaching people words, even three syllable words. ""In-fla-tion. Inflation!"" Scary! Next, some of these MAGA people will be reading and writing their own names on legal documents and God knows what else. Stop them before they bring literacy to the population. Before you know it, people will start to believe that crime is real and for the record, it's not.  

See, that's the thing. You know what they're doing? Do you know what they're doing, these racists? They're weaponizing crime. It's not the guy with the weapon who's the problem, the one stealing your purse or raping you or breaking into your house or carjacking you with the kids in the back. No, no, no. That's not the weapon that we need to worry about. The weapon is you're noticing that it's happening and in case you don't believe that, we have statistics and they appeared the other day on CNN. CNN read a report on FBI crime stats showing that crime is down. Kind of forgot to mention that the FBI report they cited left out 40% of major cities in the United States, including the two biggest New York and Los Angeles. Just kind of forgot that, except for the population centers, but, you know, Bangor and Great Falls. Totally fine! It's totally fine! 

Again, this is not a small lie. Not a small lie! It's a big lie, the big lie, but that's a phrase they use. Of course, they do. They're also denying there's anything wrong with our southern border. . Actually, we do. Here it is.  

Why aren’t they talking about climate change? Haven’t they seen the Greta videos? Climate change is what matters. Instead, they're talking about their country, their stupid country, because 5 million people show up. You're racist if you notice. Again, nothing you just heard refutes in any way the facts that Fox News puts on a loop. What it addresses is you and the person it attacks is you because you dared to notice.   

Of the many lies they're pushing, maybe the most bewildering of all, is the idea that you can destroy democracy by voting. Really? We are under the impression you destroy democracy with artillery or by changing the population of your country by opening the borders, thereby watering down the voting power of the population, its citizens. That might be destroying democracy, but no. Now we've learned that the real attack on democracy is electoral disobedience. Watch this.  

This is ultimately a news show. We have our opinions, but it's also incumbent on us to check the facts. We have a sample ballot here, and we're checking and it turns out democracy is not on the ballot. 

There are actually names of candidates who are on the  and you get to choose one as a voter, the one who best represents you and you get to choose any candidate you want because it's a democracy, meaning you run the government because it's your country. So no, democracy is not on the ballot and of course, they knew that. 

What they're really telling you is that the threat to democracy is voters. Don't you dare destroy this beautiful representative government by asking it to represent you. How dare you! Democracy means supporting Joe Biden and anything less than that is insurrection. That's the script they're reading and the amazing thing is some of the more feeble-minded among them actually seem to believe it. So, Michael Beschloss, for example. 

Beschloss is living proof they don't have to pass an IQ test to become a historian. You just have to call yourself one.. They hauled in Beschloss the other day from semi-retirement to ruminate about democracy and they expected him to say ""democracy is on the ballot"" and he may have said that, but as he got going, he lost control of himself. Watch this. 

A week away! What? We don't know where Michael Beschloss is broadcasting from. It didn't look like a bunker. It looked like a French country kitchen that his decorator put together, but whatever. Hop he's stockpiling low carb pasta because it could be a dark tomorrow. Now, keep in mind, this is the guy who is advising Joe Biden on extremism, but needless to say, he does not regard himself as an extremist.  

. That's his campaign slogan. It's not quite as reassuring as, say, a ""chicken in every pot"" or even ""hope and change,"" but at this point, Democrats are out of hope and above all, they fear change. They want things to stay exactly the way they are.

Not since the men of ancient Athens scratched their preferences on pottery shards, has a democratic election been freer or fair than the one we saw in this country two years ago. That's what you have heard a lot. 

 than any president ever – 81 million at least and every single one of those votes was entirely real! There was no cheating of any kind. Every mail-in-ballot belonged to a real person who voted just once. No drop box was stuffed. Nobody coached dementia patients in nursing homes to vote the democratic line. Even Vladimir Putin somehow decided to stay out of that election. 

Tech oligarch Mark Zuckerberg did get involved. He spent $400 million to control the mechanics of the election, but for the very best reasons. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to keep voters safe from the deadly coronavirus. His reward is in heaven. And above all, in case you were wondering, voting machines around this country recorded the legitimate results with flawless precision. 

The machines counted each vote cast for each candidate and awarded those votes accordingly. Can you see the software that would prove that happened? Well, no, you can't. As with the body cam footage from Nancy Pelosi's house, you don't have the necessary clearance to see it. But you can know that electronic voting machines are 100% safe and reliable and that's why government officials have told you again and again that the 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history."" Believe it. By the way, if you don't believe it, our advice is to shut the hell up unless you want to be sued into bankruptcy or have the FBI interrupt your breakfast.  

That, in summation, is the official media-approved view of our last election. It was perfect. Don't ask questions. 

So, given that we were a little surprised, we pulled up Politico this morning. Politico is the publication that helps control the rest of the media on behalf of the Biden administration. We were surprised to discover that actually voting machines are not safe at all. Electronic voting machines, Politico told us, are in fact easily hacked and manipulated, which is why real countries like France have banned them and use paper ballots instead. ""There are real risks,"" Politico told us, ""that hackers could tunnel into voting equipment and other election infrastructure to try to undermine Tuesday's vote."" 

According to Politico, that's entirely possible because many states ""use wireless modems to transmit unofficial election night results to their central offices. These modems use telecommunications networks that are vulnerable to hackers, and malicious actors could exploit them to tamper with unofficial vote data, corrupt voting machines or compromise the computers used to tally official results."" 

Rigged voting machines? Fake vote totals? Underground tunnels to subvert modems? Isn't this the release the Kraken talk? Well, it is. and as of yesterday, it would have been regarded as insane, possibly criminal. It would have been an assault on our democracy. But things have changed. 24 hours before Democrats are expected to lose in the midterm elections, Politico is letting you know that elections are fake and not just because of rigged electronics voting machines, by the way. There's an even bigger problem.  

Somehow, despite the best efforts of Google and Facebook, some of Joe Biden's critics have been allowed to speak in public. And that means it's possible that their dangerous opinions may have infected the minds of some confused and mentally enfeebled voters, tricking them into not loving Joe Biden. This is known in the business as misinformation. If left untreated, it can develop into a condition called disinformation. Watch CNN explain the difference. 

. 

First we learned that the voting machines are hacked and then we learn not only do we have disinformation, but the disinformation is coming from inside the house. It's terrifying. On MSNBC, we learned that communities of color are suffering the most.  

Honestly, it's pretty easy to fool Black men, says Stacey Abrams, whom we should remind you, is not at all a racist. She's just keeping it real. 

Is Anderson Cooper a racist? Well, we can't say, but he is concerned that there are an awful lot of gullible Mexicans out there. Watch Anderson Cooper.  

Now, maybe we're giving them too much credit, but we didn't realize that Anderson Cooper hated Hispanics. We thought he loved them. Yet there he was in the tape we just played you – those damn Mexicans and their conspiracy theories, which, if you think about it, is itself a kind of conspiracy theory. Anderson Cooper knows because he's read on Twitter that nonwhite voters are rejecting the Democratic Party in record numbers, but why are they doing that? That's the question. We know they can't be thinking for themselves and drawing their own conclusions like adults. That's impossible. They're not capable of that. So, there must be disinformation afoot. That's his conclusion. Of course, Stacey Abrams agrees and she's no racist.  

This is what panic looks like. These are people who know they're about to get crushed, and they're desperate to pretend that they're not responsible for it.

The Guardian newspaper announced today that if we don't eliminate freedom of speech in this country and impose more censorship to fight disinformation, voters might try to opt out of the current utopia and at that point, we'll have civil war. 

""Judges will be assassinated. Democrats and moderate Republicans will be jailed on bogus charges. Black churches and synagogues will be bombed. Pedestrians will be picked off by snipers in city streets."" They printed that. Message, bottom line: Democrats absolutely cannot lose tomorrow's elections. That's their view. This cannot happen. So, with that in mind, they're already preparing the rest of us for election theft, which if you don't want a civil war you shouldn't complain about, you should just passively accept.  

ABC News posted a story tonight letting us know that a ""’red mirage’ or an artificial GOP vote lead will likely reoccur on Tuesday. Early  results might not indicate final tallies, and that's okay."" 

In other words, to our readers, says ABC News, don't worry, John Fetterman is going to win.

762	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-republicans-underperform-midterms	2022-11-09 23:27:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Why did Republicans underperform in the midterms? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the results of the 2022 midterm elections looks at where Republicans went wrong on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

What exactly happened in yesterday's ? Well, we wish you could tell you with some precision. That's our job, but we can't, because in a number of key races around the country, we still don't have a vote total. In Arizona, for example, there is no declared winner in the Senate race or in the governor's race. At this point, it seems likely that both Kari Lake and Blake Masters will win. We'll be speaking to Kari Lake in just a minute about that, but according to news reports, the official results may not be in for more than a month. A month! 

Officials in  told CNBC today that they are ""prepared to work through Thanksgiving and possibly Christmas as well."" That means results by New Year’s in a race that was held in early November. That seems late. How late is it? Well, by comparison, the results of the 1862 midterm elections, which were tabulated by candlelight without machines or even electricity in the middle of a raging civil war, were clear before the end of the week. That was the entire country. Arizona is a single state, which, by the way, is a fraction of the size of Florida, which, as you may have noticed, counted its votes in less than a day—so did Brazil, an entire country.  

That seems embarrassing, if not like a full-blown emergency. Counting the votes isn't some added extra you get from government if they have a surplus, like fighting climate change or bringing equity. Counting the votes is a core function of government, along with law enforcement, maintaining the roads and keeping the border secure. Efficient elections are the reason you pay taxes, but Arizona doesn't seem to have them. Why is that? , commands CNN.  

You see, that's our first votes and that's the wonder of democracy, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican and I wanted to point that out to be a little bit of the crank in the room following Brianna there. Stay off social media, people, if you're trying to figure out, ""Are there really issues with voting?"" Trust your local officials. Trust us here. Trust a news source that you know and trust to be honest about this. They're doing their job and they're doing it right. 

 Really CNN? Can we get a little more reporting on that? How right are they doing it? It's pretty funny, but we digress. The state of our election systems in many places is indeed pretty embarrassing, but so, honestly, were the results of last night's elections. Republicans swore they were going to sweep, a red tsunami. That's they told us and we, to be honest, cautiously believe them, but they did not sweep, not even close to sweeping.  

The Republican Party in the end, may take control of the , but only by a tiny margin at best. That's great, but it was not the plan. The plan was really simple. It seemed easy a week ago, an unpopular president, a faltering economy, an open border, the looming risk of nuclear war (How about that?) put all those together, how could there not be a massive Republican win nationally? Wins everywhere?  

Well, there weren't—some exceptions—but overall, there weren't.  was not punished back. He was out there bragging about himself today. Pretty frustrating. You want the Republicans to win not simply because they're so great, but because Democrats are so very bad and that's not an overstatement. What happened? Well, before we give you our theories as to what happened, one obvious point is the people whose job it was to win, but did not win should go do something else now. 

We're speaking specifically of the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate and of the RNC. There's nothing personal. Some of them are no doubt nice people, but they took hundreds of millions of dollars to paint the map red and they didn't. It doesn't mean they're evil. It doesn't mean they should be jailed. It does mean they shouldn't be promoted. No one should ever be rewarded for failure. If there's a truly conservative principle in life, it's the principle of the meritocracy. You reward excellence. You do not reward mediocrity and when you do, things fall apart.  

Democrats kept promoting Tony Fauci despite his obvious ineptitude. What is that? That's corruption. Republicans should never do anything like that and if they do, what's the point of voting for them? They're no different. The question is, why did Republicans underperform last night? You're hearing a lot of people saying it was about abortion. Suburban ladies were mad about Roe. That's certainly plausible in some places, probably true. On the other hand, a number of resolute, pro-life Republicans thrived statewide. They would include Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Ted Budd in North Carolina, a pro-life result. Abortion may have been a factor, but it's not the whole answer.  

Many others are saying that Donald Trump is the reason Republicans didn't do as well as they thought they would. That's a more complicated question. The truth is, we can't really see the entire picture this early. The truth is, Trump has always been a mixed blessing politically. The downsides are marbled in with the upsides, but in this case, he's certainly not the single cause of anything. Republicans last night suffered a fair amount of down ballot losses in races that had nothing to do with Trump, in Michigan, for example. Whether you like Trump or not, and many don't and a lot do, it's a lot more complicated than just him.  

Then there's the most amusingly stupid explanation of all: bad candidates were the problem. That's all over Twitter. All the Twitter pundits are telling you now the candidates were subpar and that was the problem. Candidate quality matters. Well, of course, strictly speaking, that is true. The quality of a candidate does matter, but really, how much does it matter? Well, let's see. Joe Biden got elected president two years ago from his basement. John Fetterman became a U.S. senator last night. Does anyone think John Fetterman was a quality candidate? Is that why he won, because they had quality candidates on the left? Do the voters of Pennsylvania really want a brain damaged candidate who's never had a real job? Did they think he was more impressive than the guy who spent his career doing heart transplants? Probably not.  

You've got to give them credit for at least knowing who they were voting for and they voted for John Fetterman. He won anyway. What does that tell you? It tells you that in some cases, candidate quality is not actually the most important thing. What is? Well, the mechanics of an election. They matter. In fact, they matter sometimes more than any individual running in the election. The way people vote makes a big difference to the outcome and so, by the way, does access to channels of communication. Why does that matter? Well, because you can say whatever you want, but if no one hears you, you're not really speaking and that's the case for Republicans so often, as if Republicans can communicate their message unencumbered on a single cable television channel and a handful of relatively low traffic websites. That's it.  

The rest of the American media amounts to a gigantic filter designed to distort what Republicans are saying. It's a campaign apparatus and only the Democrats have it. Now you can whine about that (""The media are liberal!""), but it's not about liberal or conservative. It's about winning elections and Democrats can win because they have that. If Republicans want to win elections, too, they might spend some money to fix that, to achieve parity. 

To restate, as of tonight, Democrats have far more control of the election machinery and almost total control of the American media and Republicans don't. These are not ideological problems. It's not a question of who's right on the issues. That's settled, certainly in our mind, but probably in the minds of even people who would vote Republican if it occurred to them, but it doesn't because they don't know what they stand for.  

These are questions, again, not of who's right and who's wrong, but of who makes it into elected office, of who wields power and many on the right don't seem to understand this at all. They don't care about the details. Two and a half years ago, the last administration, its Republican allies in Congress, watched passively, seemingly in glassy eyed sedation as the Democratic Party used the pretext of COVID to rewrite election laws around the country in order to get its own candidates into office. They didn't do it by accident. They knew what they were doing. Last night those laws, many of which are still on the books, paid off generously. John Fetterman bombed in his one public debate. You saw it. He humiliated himself. He made a mockery of the election, but it didn't matter by that point. 

Thanks to early voting, Fetterman's margin was already in the bank. Nearly 70% of Democrats had voted early in the Pennsylvania races. Only 20% of Republicans did. It's over, but it doesn't need to be repeated. These are fixable problems. You can get your message out. You can force the other side if you try hard enough to agree on fair election rules, but you can't do any of that unless you acknowledge these problems exist. Those are probably the real problems, but enough for the depressing recap. There were bright spots last night. There were, as dispirited as you may have been, and we think it's important to enjoy them always.  

The good news is worth savoring. The first piece of good news is actually the flip side of the worst piece of news, which is that John Fetterman won in Pennsylvania and not only did John Fetterman win, but he won without speaking a single, coherent sentence for the entire campaign. Now, you may be appalled by that, but in some sense it's an achievement. John Fetterman, in winning, shattered the thickest of all glass ceilings, which for centuries has prevented the unapologetically brain damaged from winning statewide election. So, John Fetterman is not just a U.S. senator now. He's a pioneer and there's nothing the Democratic Party loves, reveres and elevates more quickly than a pioneer. Take a look at the White House press secretary. 

The question is, given his inspiring achievement, how can John Fetterman not be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2024? We can't control that. We want him and Kamala to fight it out, but in the meantime, expect a huge amount of uncomfortable entertainment value from Senator John Fetterman. Savor every moment.  

The second piece of good news for Republicans that they really should celebrate because it's great: sometimes watching your enemies get vanquished is a virtue in itself. The D.C.C.C. congressional chairman, Sean Patrick Maloney, lost, probably the oiliest, slipperiest and by far not the stupidest member of Congress on the Democratic side. Maloney lost to a man called Michael Lawler in a race that nobody thought a Republican could ever win.  

In a moment, we'll speak to Lawler and ask how he did it, but it seems like Lawler won for a couple of reasons. The first is that Sean Patrick Maloney, like so many other Democrats, spent the last year and a half huffing and puffing about January 6. Unlike most of them, clever as he is, Maloney seemed to actually believe it. He's the one who claimed that Officer Brian Sicknick ""was killed"" on January 6. Last night after his defeat when he once again invoked, can you guess it? January 6.  

A short while ago, I spoke to my opponent, Michael Lawler, and congratulated him on a good win. We hope the high watermark of some of the anger and the division that we have dealt with this entire cycle from January 6 on through, and we hope for something better for our country because that's what all Americans deserve. 

We mentioned he was clever. What seemed like a gracious concession (and we're all in need of those on both sides) was, in fact, another attack on January 6, the insurrection. What's interesting is that Maloney's district is fairly upscale and includes the north suburbs of New York City. It went for Biden by five points just a couple of years ago and that support collapsed last night. Now, if there's one group Republicans have had trouble winning recently since the inversion of 2016, it's upper income white-collar voter, but in that district, they went Republican. Republicans should study what happened there and not just there, all over New York.  

Democrats lost several seats across the Hudson Valley, in Long Island, in very blue areas and that means that Democrats (this is their base, upscale suburban voters), are more vulnerable than they believe they are and again, Republicans should study how exactly that happened. One race that will be studied for quite a long time and enjoyed for at least six years is what happened in Ohio last night. 

Republicans in Ohio stunned the Democratic Party. Now they'll tell you, ""Oh, it was a Republican state,"" but even by the standards of a so-called Republican state, Republicans dominated in Ohio last night. No Democrat came within ten points of any Republican in races for executive positions or Supreme Court races. Now, in the now famous race for Senate in Ohio, Democrats spent tens of millions of dollars more than the winner did. That would be JD Vance, but JD Vance won and then why did he win? He won as a decent person and that's rare in any legislative body and he won on the right message. Watch this.  

Now, the people of Ohio have given us a job and what we need to do over the next couple of years, over the next six years for the full length of this Senate term, whoever is in the majority, whatever the president looks like, we have a very simple job to do. It's to go to work every single day and fight for the people of Ohio, fight for our workers, fight for our families, fight for the people struggling with the opioid addiction problem, fight for the people, the single moms struggling to raise babies just like my mom raised me. We have got a great state. Whether you voted for me or not, the things that I promise to do is go to the United States Senate and fight every single day for the people of Ohio. Thanks to you, we get an opportunity to do just that.  

We've lost more than 100,000 Americans in the last year, mostly young people from drug ODs. That's just the last year. Many hundreds of thousands over the past five years and yet, when was the last time you saw someone mention it in a victory speech?  JD Vance said that and he clearly means it and he won by a lot, despite being outspent by a lot.  

That is really good news. Almost as good, we will not see for quite some time the likes of Beto O'Rourke and Stacey Abrams again because they lost yet again. How many offices have these two run for? How much money have Democratic donors spent to get them elected? A lot. Hundreds of millions of dollars and both are unemployed because it doesn't matter how much you spend on the advertising campaign for the dog food. If the dogs don't like it, they won't eat it. That's an old saying from political consultants and in this case, it is true. Beto O'Rourke and Stacey Abrams rejected thoroughly in favor of people who are not professional politicians in a number of cases on the Republican side.  

Now the last and probably biggest piece of good news, as you already know, is what happened last night in the state of Florida. Put bluntly, Ron DeSantis absolutely killed it and the closer you look at the numbers, the more interesting and revealing and heartening it is. Voters of every education level supported Ron DeSantis over Charlie Crist. That has not happened typically in elections statewide. Ron DeSantis even won among post grads by 7%. If you think that sounds normal, go look at the past five elections. 

Republicans do not win statewide among people with post-graduate degrees, but DeSantis did. He won all but five counties in Florida. To the astonishment of MSNBC and the entire Democratic political establishment, DeSantis even managed to flip Miami-Dade County. Now, Miami-Dade is, by definition, a Democratic county, but he was not the only Republican who won there. Another did as well. Miami-Dade went for Hillary Clinton by 30 points in 2016. Listen to the audible gasp at MSNBC as they realized Hispanic voters had betrayed their lesson instructions.  

I'm told we just got Miami-Dade. This is a big one in Florida. Let's take a look at this. 

Wow.  

Yeah, so let's put this in some perspective. Miami-Dade County has two and three quarter million people. In 2016, this was a Democratic county by 30 points. Hillary Clinton won this county by 30 points. Miami-Dade is 70% Hispanic and look at this. In the mail-in and early vote, which again tends to be more Democratic friendly, Marco Rubio, the Republican, is outright leading in Miami-Dade County by seven points.  

Exactly and good for them for being honest about what happened. Really no lying about it and again, it wasn't just Ron DeSantis. It was also Marco Rubio. No Republican has won in Miami-Dade County in 20 years, but Ron DeSantis did it. Marco Rubio did it. In the end, DeSantis won by nearly 20 points. Things were so bad for Democrats in Florida that CBS went looking for Charlie Crist supporters and couldn't find any in public. Watch.  

By the way, I got to point out that once we started digesting our food and digesting the day, we realized that on that day long trip, we spoke to dozens of people up and down the coast of Florida, all in precincts, by the way, that voted for President Biden in 2020, but to our surprise, we did not run into a supporter of Ron DeSantis' Democratic opponent. That would be Charlie Crist.  

Poor Charlie Crist, but this… I mean, of course, Charlie Crist was the lamest possible candidate the Democrats ever could have run, probably because they knew that DeSantis was going to win. This is one of those rare elections in which voters were, of course, rejecting the other side, but in this election, a lot of those voters appear, and the polling shows this, to be affirming the side they voted for. They weren't just voting against. They were voting for. They're voting for Ron DeSantis. Pretty amazing, actually. According to DeSantis, this is a realignment. Here he is. You know, over these.  

Past four years, we've seen major challenges for the people of our state, for the citizens of the United States, and, above all, for the cause of freedom. We saw freedom in our very way of life in so many other jurisdictions in this country wither on the vine. Florida held the line. We chose facts over fear. We chose education over indoctrination. We chose law and order over rioting and disorder. Thanks to the overwhelming support of the people of Florida, we not only won election. We have rewritten the political map.  

As disappointed as you may have been by the results last night, what happened in Florida is legitimately a big deal. It will probably a while before we know exactly what it means, but we know for certain that it was out of the ordinary, unexpected and profound and as we told you a minute ago, the other thing that happened that was kind of great that we're enjoying is that the guy in charge of getting Democrats elected to Congress himself lost. His name is Sean Patrick Maloney. He represented the Hudson Valley. He was beaten by Mike Lawler who is now the congressman elect.

763	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lie-millions-americans-killed	2022-11-16 22:02:00	TUCKER CARLSON: This lie could get millions of Americans killed | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to false reports Russian missiles hit Poland and gives his take on the FTX meltdown on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The frustrating thing about the news media, no matter how horrible they are, is that you need them. You can't understand the world except through the news media. That's where all of our information comes from. We can't really change that at this point, but we can go into it with open eyes. 

You should know that the thing about reading the news is, even when it's not intentionally dishonest and often it is, no matter what the intent of it, the first draft of the story that you read is always wrong — not sometimes wrong — always wrong, occasionally in small ways, sometimes in big and utterly distorting ways: ""Dewey defeats Truman. Iraq has nukes.  bombed its own pipeline."" Stories like this are laughably untrue. They are an inversion of the truth, which inevitably emerges later and at times it's unintentional. They just made a mistake. They got it wrong, but more often on the big stories, the ones that change policy, they are lying on purpose.  

How do you know whether they're lying on purpose or whether they just got it wrong by accident? Well, when the story trends on social media, you know. That means that somewhere there's a tech executive who's decided to crank up the propaganda dial in order to manipulate you. It's really not so different from what the North Korean state news agency does. When there's a famine, they start promoting stories about record rice harvests, so you wouldn't notice. 

With that in mind, it would have been worth pausing for a moment in skepticism when you saw that story on your phone yesterday about how . Poland is a member of NATO, the North American Treaty Organization and so are we. That means if Russia were to attack NATO, then we could very easily be obligated to attack Russia back. Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, so that would be inevitably, by definition, World War III. Hundreds of people might die. This was not a small story. It was Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo stuff. 

This story came, as it so often does, from the Associated Press, citing, again as usual an ""unnamed senior U.S. Intel official."" According to this unnamed Intel official, Russia had launched an entirely unprovoked first strike against Poland. The Russian military had lobbed missiles into Polish territory, thereby killing two Poles at a farm, so by definition it was time for Europe and the U.S to invoke Article Five, the collective defense principle, and begin a total war on Vladimir Putin. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine agreed with this. The U.S. must declare war on Russia in the wake of this story. Watch his reaction.  

This is a Russian missile attack on collective security. It's not simply in Poland or on Ukraine, but on the United States. It's an attack on the U.S. by Russia and ""we must act."" This is a man of some moral authority. This is the only head of state in the world to receive a Vogue photo spread this year. There's a personal friend of Sean Penn and Ben Stiller and here he was commanding the U.S. to lead the third world war immediately. As we said, this was not a minor AP story. The only problem was it was completely and utterly wrong. 

  

Zelenskyy, the unnamed American intel officer and the Associated Press had all been trafficking in dangerous misinformation. That became clear within a few hours when pictures of the exploded missile surfaced on social media. People who know a lot about military hardware started asking questions about this stuff. They looked at a picture of a fragment of the motor from this destroyed missile and they noticed the ordnance was an S-300 system. Now, the S-300 system is only being used by the Ukrainian military, not the Russians, so it could not have been a Russian military attack. 

Somehow Ukraine had bombed Poland and killed people. That's true and within a day, the Pentagon, NATO and even the government of Poland all were forced to admit that. That's what happened. Ukraine did it, but here's the interesting thing, the thing that is relevant to us. Ukraine never admitted that. Zelenskyy kept lying on television. So, when you run a country where the free press has been banned, as it has been in Ukraine, you may not realize that the rest of the world is not required to believe you. You can't throw them all in jail. So, he kept telling you what you knew was not true 

""I have no doubt that this is not our missile,"" he said today. ""I believe that this was a Russian missile based on military reports."" Again, that's not only untrue, it's a lie that could get millions of Americans killed. You have to ask yourself, is it time to stop backing this guy? Could the risk be too high? He's lying on purpose to get us into a war. Maybe he's not worth supporting in the first place. Maybe he's just another corrupt Eastern European strongman in a tracksuit, getting as rich as he can from American handouts. That might be the lesson, but that is not at all the lesson that the Biden administration is drawing from what just happened. Watch former Raytheon board member Lloyd Austin explain that. Even if the missile attack was from Ukraine, it's still Russia's fault. 

This is not what we would refer to as evidence-based reasoning. What you're hearing from the secretary of defense is that Ukraine lobbed a missile into Poland and killed Poles, but you need to continue to send billions to Ukraine to fight Russia. So, now you're starting to see why the unnamed Intel official leaked this story to the Associated Press in the first place, this manufactured story, and the point, of course, was to manipulate the United States Congress, as so often happened.  

Unnamed American intel official leaked something to The New York Times, Washington Post, AP. Members of Congress read this and do what the intel agencies and the administration want them to do and we can all but prove that in this case, because shortly after this fake news of this fake Russian missile attack appeared on the AP wire, the White House demanded another $37 billion in funding for Ukraine. 

That raises the question, where does that put us? What's the total that we've sent to Ukraine so far? Well, in just nine months, the Biden administration has committed a total of $91 billion to Ukraine at a time when our borders still open and our economy is degrading fast. How much is that? Well, as Glenn Greenwald pointed out today, $91 billion is twice the average annual U.S. expenditure during our own war in Afghanistan. $91 billion is 33% more than the entire annual military budget of the entire country of Russia, but it's not enough. Today, Mark Milley informed us that $91 billion is just the beginning. 

So, there you have the obedient little general reading the talking points again, but it still doesn't answer the question: Why? As long as it takes? OK, some things are worth that commitment, but why this one? What is the point of this exactly? We can't say we're defending democracy in Ukraine, which is not a democratic country. We can't explain clearly or even at all where our national security interest lies in this conflict between two Eastern European countries. So, why would we bankrupt ourselves to fund it?  

Could it be that this entire effort is a choreographed scam to enrich the Democratic Party and its allies and achieve left-wing ideological goals that have nothing to do with the core interests of the United States? Could it be that this whole thing is BLM, Eastern European edition? Well, it's possible, because that is how Washington actually works and the brewing FTX scandal kind of exposes that.  

You may have read about this. FTX is the cryptocurrency exchange that just blew up in one of the single biggest one-day losses in world history, possibly the biggest ever. Now, what was FTX? It wasn't a conventional business. No. In fact, it was the finance arm of the Democratic Party and the back scratching, the snake eating its tail, is on full display in this story. Democrats invited FTX's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, to the White House to discuss crypto regulation. The people who are supposed to be keeping this business within the lines, were actually colluding with the business and doing nothing to keep it from defrauding its investors. 

Then in Congress, who was also supposed to be overseeing the finance sector, Maxine Waters, who chairs the Financial Services Committee, was palling around with Sam Bankman-Fried. She took the picture with him. You're seeing on your screen now. That picture was taken after the first ever hearing on crypto regulations. That's a pretty good deal. You're running a scam and the regulators are on your side. How do you keep them on your side? Well, if you're Sam Bankman-Fried, you donate nearly $40 billion to Democrats in the midterm, which he did and that total puts him number two on the donor list right below George Soros.  

Now that's so obviously illegal and wrong and corrupt that you probably want to make sure nobody wrote about it and that's why Sam Bankman-Fried also bought off the media. He handed millions to places like Vox, The Intercept, Semafor, and ProPublica and probably many others. So, with tens of billions of dollars evaporating into thin air and Sam Bankman-Fried not even within the borders of the United States tonight, the question is: where are investors left? There are a lot of big retirement funds who are invested in this thing in this country and in Canada. 

Will they get any of their money back? What about the money that Sam Bankman-Fried gave to the Democratic Party? Will the Democrats have to give it back to the people who are defrauded? Will, the media companies that took it, Semafor for example, have to give it back to the people whose money was effectively stolen? Well, Maxine Waters was a beneficiary of this and she was asked today whether she's returning any of these donations. FOX's Hillary Vaughn just caught up with Waters and she made it very clear, of course, she's keeping the money. 

Yeah, yeah. Everyone did it. No, actually, everyone didn't do it. This was the finance arm of the Democratic Party, one of the biggest stories of the year, maybe the last ten years. We're going have a lot more on it tomorrow and in the weeks to come, but why are we telling you about it tonight? We're telling you about it because you should know that  was also in partnership with the government of Ukraine because all threads returned to the same spool. It'd be interesting to know how much money, if any, Ukraine funneled back to FTX, which then wound up in the hands of Democrats running for Congress in this last cycle.  

We don't know the answer. An audit might tell us. There has been no audit. Today in the House, Marjorie Taylor Greene has been demanding an audit, but to no avail so far and that means the tens of billions of your tax dollars the Biden administration has shoveled to the government of Ukraine remain as of tonight, completely unaccounted for. We don't know what happened to the money and still the Ukrainians are demanding more and trying to get us into a world war that would benefit us in no way. Are Republicans supporting this? Could any Republican possibly support this? More money for Ukraine with no audit? Any Republican who does deserves, at the very least, a lifetime of scorn.

764	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-free-society-requires-comedians	2022-11-18 21:47:00	TUCKER CARLSON: A free society requires comedians | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to comedy being under attack on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Josh Denny is a comedian. You may have heard of him. He used to work for the Food Network. He's also pro-life, personally, and willing to say so out loud. 

Earlier this month, Denny was preparing to host a comedy show in Rutherford, New Jersey. That's about a half hour outside of New York, but just minutes after the show was announced, Antifa, a violent, radical group, decided to shut it down.  

Hundreds of Antifa-affiliated Twitter accounts started bombarding the venue called the Williams Center. They also went after the chief of police of Rutherford, a man called John Russo and they threatened violence. Now, at that point, a chief of police who wanted to defend the Constitution, his solemn duty, would have pushed back and affirmed the sacred right of free expression of every American, but that's not what Chief Russo did. Instead, he caved to the demands of the mob.  

He warned the venue that the venue might face civil liability if they let free speech continue, if they allowed the show to go on. Then he said he would shut down the show on ""public safety grounds."" So ultimately, the Williams Center had no choice and canceled the show. In the end, the only people who showed up at the Williams Center that night were several police officers, and they were there to make sure there was no comedy taking place, none at all.  

Then, to add insult to injury, the next morning, the mayor of Rutherford, New Jersey, Frank Nunziato, bragged about what the city had done. He said it was his decision to use the power of the state to cut down comedy. ""Unbeknownst to the borough,"" Nunziato wrote, ""an event was planned for this evening at the Williams Center, news of which quickly circulated through social media. Online intelligence led the police department to believe that the event had the potential for concentrate confrontation. Therefore,"" Nunziato said, ""after discussions with the owner, the event has been canceled."" 

Now notice the blame shifting here, the potential for confrontation. It wasn't the comedian who was going to confront or threaten anyone with violence. It was the radical left-wing group Antifa. But it was the comedian who was punished.

This is not the first time Josh Denny has experienced this. It's happened four times in just the past few weeks. Shows were canceled because of threats from the left. Two shows were canceled in Chicago, another two in New York and every time the same pattern. Denny would schedule a comedy show. Then a huge amount of Antifa-affiliated Twitter accounts intimidated the venue and local officials, who collapsed under the pressure and shut it down. 

Denny can no longer speak. At this point, the only way he can host a show north of the Mason-Dixon Line is to deliver cryptic instructions to his fans about where to meet secretly, like a speakeasy. Otherwise, if he doesn't do this, all Antifa has to do to end free speech is send some tweets ,and then weak leaders capitulate immediately.  

Josh Denny is not the only performer being targeted, and it's not just comedians. This, of course, is part of a much larger campaign to end free speech in the United States, a country whose civic religion was free speech just a few years ago. This is a huge change and an ominous one. Anyone who tells you that you can't say what you truly believe is ia totalitarian.  

Make no mistake. It's not about sensitivity. It's about controlling you. It's totalitarian. We're going to start tonight with what's happening to comedians because free society requires comedians. Comedy is the way we tell the truth. The presence of comedians in a society means that you get to mock the people in charge very quickly and it's not an accident we're running out of comedians. Only rote comedy is tolerated now and that's another way of saying no comedy is tolerated now. Elon Musk pointed this out a few months ago in an interview with the satire site The Babylon Bee.  

Well, after that interview, Twitter, as if to prove it, has no sense of humor at all, banned the Babylon Bee. Their crime? They made fun of the administration's fake trans admiral, that guy in a dress they're calling female. We all know what Elon Musk did next. He bought Twitter. In a moment, we'll speak to the CEO of the Babylon Bee about what Musk must do to restore free speech to this country. 

What is clear at this point is that after Elon Musk fired half of Twitter's employees, Twitter got better. Why? Because they were the censors. And Twitter isn't the only company many of whose employees work effectively as censors to shut down your freedom to say what you think. 

Outside Netflix headquarters last year, protesters, some of them Netflix employees, gathered to demand the censorship of Dave Chappelle. Watch this. 

So, what you had at Netflix is what you also had at Twitter, and it's the same phenomenon that's canceling comedians all over the country. A small group of politically inflamed, highly-motivated extremists who prevent the majority from saying what it thinks. Another word for that is tyranny, and it's everywhere. 

One of the few people in Hollywood willing to fight back against this and say what he really thinks is Adam Carolla, a long-time comedian who has stayed true and therefore funny and he mocked the people you just saw as exactly what they are: humorous babies.  

""He's a comedian and he gets to say what he wants."" That's no longer the rule in a lot of places, but Adam Carolla lives by that rule still.

765	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-children-destroyed-by-this	2022-11-21 22:48:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Children are being destroyed by this | Fox News	"WARNING: Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out 'sexual mutilation' of children and media coverage of the Colorado Springs shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub, on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

On Saturday night, as you may now have read, a 22-year-old man called Anderson Lee Aldrich walked into a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs and opened fire. By the time he was subdued by patrons, he had murdered five people and injured another 25. 

You've seen this story before, but no matter how many times you've seen it, it never stops being horrifying and it shouldn't stop. Violence and cruelty should always horrify us every single time.  When we start to become cynical about the deaths of other human beings, we have lost something essential to our humanity. Unfortunately, you're seeing that. 

The most obvious question is, why did Anderson Lee Aldrich shoot 30 people? And the truth is, we don't know. We do know he was clearly a troubled person. Last summer, he threatened to blow up his mother's house with a bomb. Authorities had to evacuate the neighborhood during the four-hour standoff that ensued. Eventually, he surrendered.  

After that happened, he, of course, was arrested and charged with first degree kidnapping and felony menacing, but then the local district attorney, a man called Michael J. Allen, did not pursue charges. Why? We reached out to Allen's office to find out why, but he did not get back to us, so we can only guess. We do know what the effect was. Because Aldrich was never charged with a crime and his arrest record was sealed, his violent past did not show up in background checks. Threatening to murder his own mother did not prevent him from buying a firearm even under Colorado's so-called red flag law, which is designed to prevent that very thing.  

Those are the facts. That's what we know so far. Once again, authorities failed to keep the public safe. They didn't do their job. You may recognize now a pattern because you have seen that before. 

As for Aldrich's motive in shooting strangers, we can only guess and we're not going to guess both because guessing would be dishonest and irresponsible. You can't just make up a story because it suits your preexisting beliefs, but more to the point, we're not going to guess because it would dishonor the memories of the five people who were just murdered in Colorado Springs. These were human beings. They were Americans. They were not props in a larger ideological war, and to reduce them to that is wrong.  

That's exactly what many politicians are doing right now. Within hours of the shootings, Joe Biden and his allies use this tragedy as a pretext for disarming the law-abiding population of the country. We need more gun control, Joe Biden said predictably. Notwithstanding the fact that Colorado's existing gun control laws, which are extensive, did not prevent this attack. It was a contemptible and heartless and deeply cynical display of political opportunism.

But it didn't stop with gun control because, in fact, the Second Amendment is not the freedom that threatens the people in charge the most. No, that would be the First Amendment, which is your right to say what you sincerely believe. That is the right, the first in our Bill of Rights, that terrifies them the most. Your words are a greater threat than any firearm. They must censor you or else they lose power. It is that simple. 

These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing. 

  

, (which it is),  

Now that seems implausible and yet many are making this claim. Many have made it over the past 24 hours. Watch, for example, Brandy Zadrozny of NBC.  

There it is, right there. When you point out the truth, indisputably and the truth is that some adults in this country, apparently a growing number, have a deeply unhealthy fixation on the sexuality of children, when you say that out loud, you get people killed. That is what Brandy Zadrozny is saying and by saying that Brandy Zadrozny and the many people like her are effectively defending that same deeply unhealthy fixation on the .  

By the way, it's absolutely real. You're not imagining that. It's happening. The evidence is everywhere and it comes to light on the Internet. Brandy Zadrozny and people like her hate that you are seeing that. Notice that Zadrozny is not claiming that Libs of TikTok is making this up. She never even suggests that. She is threatening them and what she's doing is threatening them, you should know, and she's doing that because they're pointing it out.  

Noticing it's happening is their crime and once again, it is happening. Children's Hospital in Boston, where the most famous hospitals in the world, has admitted performing double mastectomies on children for no medical reason at all. There is no scientific justification for sexually mutilating kids. They are not doing it for a scientifically defensible reason. They are doing it because they believe in a very specific religious ideology. That's true. Is pointing that out an attack on gay people? Of course, it is not an attack on gay people. It has nothing to do with gay people. It has to do with sexually mutilating children, which is wrong, period. It should be a crime period and yet suddenly it's very common. 

As we've reported on this show. UCSF, University of California, San Francisco Hospital, one of the leading hospitals in the world, is doing this as well, and they've said so out loud. This is an actual quote from their website: ""Genital surgery is being performed on a case-by-case basis more frequently in minors. In the absence of solid evidence, providers often must rely on the expert opinions of innovators and thought leaders in the field.""  

Your child gets sexually mutilated,  that is irreversible not on the basis of science, but on the basis of innovators and thought leaders. It's hard to believe that's happening. That quote was scrubbed, by the way, after we reported on it, not because it wasn't a real quote, but because it was a real quote. It was too incriminating. 

Once again, this is everywhere. A parent in Pennsylvania, called Megan Brock decided to do some actual reporting on it because actual reporters choose not to. They look away and attack anyone who wants to know what's actually happening. She filed a records request and this week she obtained a 2017 email from Dr. Nadia Dowshen at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Again, one of the most famous hospitals in the world known as CHOP, a widely beloved institution that has helped very many. But in this case, what they were doing shocks the senses.  

In a communication with now HHS Secretary Rachel Levine, she wrote this ""I'm not aware of existing literature,"" This is Dowshen, ""but certainly it is happening. I think we've had more than ten patients who have had chest surgery under 18, (as young as 15) and bottom surgery (17)."" 

That's the sexual mutilation of children for no medical or scientific reason, simply because right now it is fashionable and consistent with a cult that has taken over a lot of the leadership of this country. But the fact remains, children are being destroyed by this. It should be a crime. The people who commit it should be in jail.

But it's not just the sexual mutilation of children in hospitals. This is part of a larger trend and the trend is this: adults crossing the line, and it has always been a bright line into deep involvement with the sexuality of children. 

That has always been and must in a civilized society, always be the most forbidden thing. It's considered unacceptable, even among prison inmates, but now it seems to be growing in its prevalence. 

Consider the latest ad for the clothing brand, Balenciaga. This was just uploaded on Instagram. As you can see, the photoshoot they're using to sell their products features a young girl holding a teddy bear in a bondage outfit. 

Then in case you missed the point, the photoshoot also contains this image. It shows several documents. Most of them aren't visible, but what you can see when you zoom in and of course, the point is that you see it, is a reference to a U.S. Supreme Court case called Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition. That case struck down a law against kiddie porn. What is this? Well, it is what it appears to be. It's an endorsement of kiddie porn, of child pornography. What else could it be? We wanted to know. We reached out today to Balenciaga to get their explanation and they didn't respond. 

So, we're going to have to take that on face value and ask, where's the moral outrage? We have an entire industry in this country comprised of moral outrage merchants. 

If you've ever been on Twitter, you know what we mean. Truly, an entire sector of our economy is devoted to attacking people for falling short of the mark, and here is a high-end retailer promoting kiddie porn in an ad on Instagram and nobody notices. 

There's no boycott. There's no front-page New York Times editorial against it and of course, Instagram, let the advertisement run endorsing kiddie porn and by the way, if you have an alternate explanation for what this was, let us know. A child with a teddy bear in a bondage outfit, and a Supreme Court decision striking down a kiddie porn law displayed on the table. What is that? Are we jumping to conclusions? Don't think so. It is what it appears to be. 

It's right in your face and no one's saying anything. Again, Instagram had no problem with this. Until Elon Musk took over Twitter, Twitter allowed hashtags that explicitly linked to child pornography. Nobody said anything because crimes against children are no big deal. It's thought crimes that are the real crimes.

 If you said something about it, if you were Libs of TikTok and said, wait a second, this seems to be abetting child molestation, which of course, that's what it's doing, you're instantly booted off Twitter. But the links to kiddie porn? They're still there. Well, now they've been deleted, thank God. That's one improvement.  

All of this has been happening out in the open, but NBC News hasn't bothered to report on any of it. Where is the report tonight: Balenciaga pushing kiddie porn in an Instagram ad? No, they're reserving all their energy to attack you for noticing. You're a stochastic terrorist if you pointed out and you need to be censored. Watch.  

Here you have people mutilating the genitals of children running ads on Instagram promoting kiddie porn, and there's Brandy Zadrozny on NBC News. She's not attacking them. She's attacking anyone who notices and accusing them of attacking gay people. Once again, this has nothing to do with gay people. This is an attack on the sexual fixation on and mutilation of the genitals of children, pushing kiddie porn. It has nothing to do gay people. That's an offense against anyone's definition of decency, and she's effectively defending it, and they all are.  

You're not allowed to notice it or else you're committing violence. You're complicit in mass murder. Well, the people who are doing these things are fine. No one attacks them. An ACLU spokesman launched this attack on Doug Lamborn, a congressman from Colorado. Watch this. ""He voted against the Respect for Marriage Act and is a co-sponsor of Marjorie Taylor Green's nationwide ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth."" Huh? That's the crime.  

Children having their genitals mutilated on the basis of no science, no actual real medical guidance, no longitudinal study. There's no evidence this is a good idea, but GLAAD is flawed, so doctors mindlessly do it and you can't complain or else you're a murderer? Too crazy. These are our children. Can't put up with it. 

For her part, GLAAD's president declared that because of Saturday's shooting, you need to shut up while activist doctors mutilate children.  

Really? Now we realize she's paid to say that, of course. All these activists are paid to say what they say, very specifically paid. ACLU is paid to say what they say. They all are. ADL is paid to say what it says. GLAAD is paid to say what it says.

But the truth is, the no B.S. scientific truth is, there's no evidence it's safe. Where's the 10-year study on that? Do you have one? Oh, you don't have one. We have no idea what the long-term effects of puberty blockers are. We have no idea.  

We can't even guess as to the long-term psychological effects of genital mutilation on a 17-year-old or 15-year-old. What? You have no idea it's safe. You're lying. It's not a safe procedure. We've spoken to a lot of victims of this barbarism, and it is barbarism. We did a whole documentary on it, and by the end of the documentary we were more shocked than when we started reporting it out.  

Even people who support these procedures can't actually defend them and that's the whole point. They have to make you shut up because they don't have any facts on their side.And it's worked on a lot of weak-minded journalists who only care about status and acceptance by the group.

766	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-no-healthy-society-tolerate-pedophilia	2022-11-22 21:43:00	TUCKER CARLSON: No healthy society can tolerate pedophilia | Fox News	"WARNING: Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips the sexual exploitation of children and the media for ignoring Balenciaga child 'bondage' ad controversy on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It is a staple of so-called conspiracy theories that at the highest levels of politics and finance, there is a shadowy cabal of  who use their power to hide the crimes they commit against children. People think that. Sounds pretty far out to us. Too dark and strange to be true and of course we are not, obviously, endorsing that idea. On the other hand, you can kind of see why people might believe it.  

Jeffrey Epstein, for example, Epstein continued to dine with business moguls and heads of state long after he was arrested for having sex with minors. How did he do that? Why didn't nobody say anything? Why did people keep eating with him? Well, at the very least, we can conclude, based on the evidence that there is a tolerance for pedophilia among some, among the most powerful in our society, a tolerance that you would not find in, say, your average middle class American family. Some of the rich really are different that way. That's clearly true and in case you need more evidence of that, consider Balenciaga. Balenciaga is what they call a luxury brand.  

Balenciaga is a company that sells $1,100 dollars sneakers and cotton sweatshirts for $1,500 bucks to people who've literally run out of things to buy. You're probably not doing your back-to-school shopping at Balenciaga, but some people apparently are. This week, Balenciaga rolled out a new ad campaign on Instagram and the selling point of the ads was sex with children. One photograph showed a very young girl lying face down on a couch with candles, empty wine glasses and a dog collar on a coffee table in front of her. Another picture showed the same girl, a toddler, holding a teddy bear dressed in sexual bondage gear, including a leather harness and then, in case you missed the point, we're for , another picture made it explicit.  

That picture showed pages from a Supreme Court opinion that struck down a law designed to fight child pornography. Whoever staged the photo shoot made certain to include a portion of that opinion that use the word ""sex"" or ""sexual"" four times and of course, that was not an accident. Balenciaga wanted you to notice. This seemed like a big story to us as we told you last night. Here you have a major international retail brand promoting kiddie porn and sex with children and not promoting it subtly, but right out in the open. 

No healthy society can tolerate that, and in fact, none ever have tolerated it. There's never been a time in American history where pedophilia was considered anything other than the worst thing, the most horrifying crime imaginable. Pedophiles famously get killed in prison because even murderers consider them immoral. That's how out of bounds it is and has always been to sexualize children.  

It's totally unacceptable, but apparently it's not unacceptable anymore. Academics have redefined child molesters as minor attracted persons and the point, of course, is to send the message that actually it's not that big a deal. It's just a different kind of love. So, maybe not surprisingly given that trend, apart from a few isolated exceptions in the American media, almost all outlets completely ignored Balenciaga's kiddie porn ad campaign.  

There was not a single story about it in the New York Times this morning, or Jeff Bezos' Washington Post or on CNN or NBC. There was no talk of an investigation or a boycott. The usual outraged merchants stayed completely silent because they weren't outraged. Balenciaga ultimately issued a statement saying it was going to punish the photographer who did the shoot like it was the photographer's fault and they didn't know about it and after that, the story effectively died and that means that the CEO of Balenciaga, a man called Cédric Charbit, it will not become a social pariah for what his company has just done. He will continue, just as Jeffrey Epstein continued, to enjoy his busy social life, totally penalized with his many fabulous celebrity friends.  

Here he is, for example, with the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who looks very excited to be with him. Now, we found that picture, by the way, in less than a minute online. It, as far as we know, apart from us on this show, no one has asked Eric Adams about it and it's likely that nobody ever will and the reason is simple. The media have no interest in covering the sexualization of children. Their interest and it's a very intense interest tellingly, so is in destroying anyone who complains about the sexualization of children or who even notices it. Noticing it, they tell us, is an attack on the LGBT community.  

The assumption here, their assumption apparently is that gay people are in favor of molesting kids and of course, in favor of performing genital mutilation on minors, but that's absurd. No normal person is for this, gay or not. It's not anti-gay to oppose kiddie porn or to feel horror at the fact that doctors are cutting the breasts off of healthy teenage girls. These are crimes and most gay people think they're crimes.  

Why wouldn't they think that? Protecting children from adults who want to sexually exploit them is a basic human instinct and it's a noble instinct and yet NBC News is doing its best to redefine that instinct as a crime. Yesterday, NBC brought on its law enforcement expert, by the way, a former assistant director of the FBI, to warn viewers that anyone who complains about the sexualization of children will be punished by the legal system, will be sued into bankruptcy and destroyed. Watch this.  

So, the former assistant director of the FBI is calling for ""civil consequences"" against anyone who doesn't like the sexualization of children.  Is that in the legal code? No, it's not, but NBC News is doing its very best to add it. MSNBC has spent the last two days suggesting that because he signed a bill banning teachers from sexualizing kindergartners, Ron DeSantis is somehow tied to a mass shooter in Colorado. 

, really? No matter how you feel about Ron DeSantis or about sex, it's not plausible. In fact, it's ridiculous. Yet they keep saying it and the question is, why do they keep saying it? Well, they're saying it because that's how determined they are to keep you from talking about the subject.  

They will call you an accessory to murder. They'll threaten to sue you into poverty as the assistant director of the FBI just did, if you don't shut up. It's pretty weird when you think about it. In fact, it's very weird, but they have nothing else to say because actually children really are being sexually exploited in this country, in some cases for money. It's not hidden. It's in the open and it's totally real. This summer, for example, Matt Walsh exposed the atrocities underway at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville. A physician there admitted to mutilating the genitals of children because it's a profit center for the hospital. Watch this. 

""It actually makes money for the hospital."" Now, if you were a muckraking reporter with a conscience, that would be the story of a lifetime. It's all there on tape. A doctor admitting they're mutilating the genitals of children for money, naming the dollar amounts. How could you pass that up? But everyone passed it up. No one covered it. Instead, journalists attacked Matt Walsh for uncovering it. Really? What's the motive there? 

Nor do they cover what's going on in hospitals across the country, including CHOP, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the famous hospital, a hospital that admitted in an email to performing  on a minor and slicing off the breast of young women for no medical reason whatsoever. There's no medical justification for that ever and yet they bragged about doing it. In Boston, a staffer at the Children's Hospital bragged on tape about two-year-olds preparing to transition. Truly insane. Utterly divorced from legitimate medicine, but again, it was completely ignored. Here it is. 

  

That is not science. That doesn't bear any resemblance to science. That's scary and yet the media choose to ignore it. Why? Because no decent person can look that or any of this in the face without wincing, because it's just too awful. It has nothing to do with medicine. It has nothing to do with improving the lives of patients or making this a better country.  

No. It is a dangerous cult that is causing irreparable harm to children—not just few, but a lot. Now, at some point when the spell breaks, our entire society will recognize this because it's obvious and we will all recoil in shame that we ever tolerated it for a second, but we're not there yet. In the meantime, we are grateful for people like Jaimee Michelle, who has had the bravery to tell the truth about what's happening in the face of unending threats.

If you've been watching the news recently, the one thing you know for certain about the accused gunman in the  over the weekend is that he was a crazed right-wing, anti-trans extremist. This is a man who was radicalized by this show and by the Twitter account Libs of TikTok to hate transgendered people and that's why this man walked into a bar, a gay bar, with a gun, and started murdering people. 

He did that because he was taught by right-wing media outlets to despise and fear the non-binary community and that's why this show and Libs of TikTok must be hauled into court and bankrupted for what we've done so that we can never provoke this kind of horrifying violence ever again. That's the real lesson of this mass shooting. 

That is what they've been telling you again and again and again on various news channels for the past three days and we're not overstating that, by the way. Here's a selection of it.  

It's a campaign being driven by members of Congress and conservative influencers on social media, as well as the right's most favorite TV network, Fox News. 

Those incidents at drag events I mentioned a few moments ago, they happened within the context of conservative media personalities fearmongering against queer folks. 

So, Fox News, in its most watched hours, is attacking even the U.S. Military and of course gay men and women and teachers too. They’re advocating ""against their right to exist."" In other words, they've been calling for genocide. That would be us. Now that's a stout claim, but no one has made it more often than NBC News, in particular, its two self-described disinformation reporters, Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny.  

These two are outraged that anyone would dare criticize the  or drag shows for fifth graders or creepy weirdo teachers explaining the mechanics of oral sex to nine-year-olds. Pointing out that any of that is happening is hate and it gets people killed. Here's a highly emotional Ben Collins of NBC News making that very point yesterday morning.  

Am I doing something wrong here? Here are some headlines that I wrote over the last six months. ""Fueled by internet's far right machine, anti-LGBTQ threats shut down trans rights and drag events."" Remember, there was a drag event happening in Colorado.  

What do we do about public officials at local level, state level, federal level, who try to inject the fear of the very word ""transgender"" into school issues?  

They get more clicks for it, and they end up on ""Tucker Carlson."" They end up on the highest rated show on cable news and last night, by the way, Tucker attacked my colleague, Brandy Zadrozny, who's covering almost all of these stories. Not me. He attacked Brandy, of course, but he attacked Brandy and he went right back into this idea that some ""they"" is trying to groom your kids, trying to sexualize your children, right? Who's the ""they,"" first of all? And second of all, all of her reporting was right. All of it was right.  

, says Ben Collins. But more to the point, how dare anyone criticize the august disinformation reporter and former college librarian Brandy Zadrozny, because as Ben Collins pointed out, her reporting was right. 

Well, since you brought it up, Ben Collins, was her reporting, right? Well, not entirely. Do you remember when Brandy Zadrozny told you several hundred times that the accused shooter, Anderson Lee Aldrich, was inspired by hatred for the non-binary community that he learned on this show? Do you remember that? Well, actually, it turns out we discovered last night, that Anderson Lee Aldrich is – drum roll, please – part of the non-binary community. 

He doesn't hate them. He is one. In a court filing, Aldrich's lawyers wrote this: "" is non-binary. They use they/them pronouns and for the purposes of all formal filings, will be addressed as Mx. Aldrich"" 

Mx. Aldrich – that's the shooter, the nonbinary shooter. Let that sink in. First, get your chuckling under control and ponder what this means. What it means is that virtually everything that NBC News has told you about this shooting in Colorado is not only wrong, it is the opposite of the truth. 

It is all a grotesque and filthy lie. It wasn't news reporting. It turns out to have been the most transparent sort of political propaganda. And for once they have been busted flat out in public trying to sell political propaganda to an unsuspecting public under the guise of news. It's not the first time they've done it. They won't stop doing it, but they did it a lot in this case. 

Here's another clip, another instance of Ben Collins trying to once again pass off political slogans as news.  

gs.  

He's emotional telling you that. . 

So, it turns out it's the town's fault, too, because there are a lot of Christians, everybody knows, in Colorado Springs. So gay people feel terrified there because Christians are dangerous and all these terrified gay people were huddled together for safety when this Fox News addled, anti-trans bigot walked in and started shooting them for being trans folk. That was Ben Collins' ""reporting."" 

Well, the only problem is not all the victims were gay. One of them, at least one of them, was at the club with his girlfriend. Oh, details, details. Ben Collins doesn't let details get in the way of an effective political attack, and it would have been an effective political attack had not reality interceded, but he doesn't care. Neither does the White House. Here's the White House telling you that because a non-binary person shut up a gay bar, you can't own a gun. 

Oh, it makes sense. You following the reasoning? So, when the trans community opens fire on itself, we need an assault weapons ban, because why? Because you're a hater.

Pete Buttigieg, of course, couldn't pass up a moment like this. It's not like Pete Buttigieg wants to talk about how things are going over at the Transportation Department, which he supposedly runs. Short answer: not well. No, Pete Buttigieg wants to talk about identity. He always wants to talk about identity. And the funny, ironic thing is just a few years ago, Buttigieg wouldn't even admit that he was gay. He hid that and then lied about it for reasons he has never been asked to explain. Why not? But whatever.  

Now he is happy to use his sexual orientation as a cudgel to bash you repeatedly in the face in the submission. Here's the latest. ""If you're a politician or media figure who sets up the LGBTQ community to be hated and feared, not because any of us who ever harmed you, but because you find it useful, then don't you dare act surprised when this kind of violence follows. Don't you dare act surprised."" 

 All right, fair enough. We won't dare, but honestly, we're a little surprised to learn that the anti-trans shooter is himself trans. Were you surprised by that, Pete Buttigieg, now that you're admitting you're gay after lying about it, since we're talking about identity, what do you have to say about that? Well, nothing weirdly. Pete Buttigieg hasn't said anything, nor does he apologize for attacking other people on false pretenses. 

Guess who else hasn't apologized? Ben Collins or Brandy Zadrozny.  

Yesterday they were accusing us of getting five people murdered. Now that the story they were telling has turned out to be a lie, the opposite of what they said it was, they're pretending that nothing has changed at all. They are liars, cold-blooded liars. It's amazing to watch.

And so IS the company they work for. NBC News just ran this article after we noted that the shooter was himself trans. They ran this headline with a straight face, ""Right-wing influencers and media doubled down on anti LGBTQ rhetoric in the wake of the Colorado shooting."" 

Can you imagine writing that knowing what we know? They had no problem with it. Then an editor at NBC called Benjamin Goggin added this, ""If the shooter is non-binary, it doesn't change the fact the right-wing media is continuing to stoke hatred towards LGBTQ people after five people were killed at a gay bar."" Right. 

So, it's hatred. If you're against genital mutilation of children or bringing toddlers to drag shows, you're against the LGBTQ+ community. Well, of course, that's insane.  

There's nothing anti-gay about that. Most gay people aren't in favor of genital mutilation or bringing toddlers to drag shows. There's nothing wrong with those opinions. They're the right opinions and all decent people understand that. What is indecent, what is wrong is lying about a mass shooting, which NBC did. So how are the rest of the media handling this? 

Well, CNN, for its part, is just denying that the shooter is really nonbinary. So, they decided to continue misgendering Mx. Aldrich. Watch this. 

  

Oh. So, in this case, if the shooter claims to be non-binary, he's got to be lying about it. It's not real. So, we're not going to call the non-binary shooter mix or observe his pronoun request. In fact, the whole pronoun thing is gone. Biology is back. He was born a man. He's still a man. It's unbelievable. What they're doing, of course, is using an actual tragedy, the murder of five people, for political reasons and of course, it's not the first time they have done that. They're happy to use death for political advantage.  

They did it with George Floyd. They did it with Officer Brian Sicknick, and it's not the most recent anti-gay attack, by the way, that's turned out to be a total lie perpetuated by the media. Just a few days ago, a guy was caught throwing a rock at a gay bar in Hell's Kitchen, New York, on camera. So, the media dutifully out interviewed the owner who said ""It feels like yet another manifestation of hate against our community."" 

A lot of big social media accounts ran with that story. More hate, more hate. So then, this is a story that didn't get quite as much coverage, the police arrested the guy who did it. His name is Sean Kuilan, and he was upset because of a dispute involving a friend. He didn't target the place because it's a gay bar. In fact and we're quoting now from the rock thrower, ""I'm gay myself.""

I mean, come on. Shouldn't someone apologize? Shouldn't someone admit that they got the facts wrong and slandered half the country on the basis of wrong facts? No. Never admit it. Never apologize. Keep moving on. Pick another story to beat you over the head with.

768	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-prosperity-country-depends-ultimately-energy	2022-11-26 00:51:00	TUCKER CARLSON: All prosperity in this country depends ultimately on energy | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson shines light on what's behind surging energy prices and inflation on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving, a day away from politics and mass media with people you love and who love you back. It's really a spiritual spa treatment. That's the idea. We ought to do it more than a couple of times a year, but we are back and now that we are, an obvious observation: All prosperity in this country depends ultimately on energy. Our consumer economy runs on it. 

It takes energy to make things and bring them to your house. Our tech economy runs on energy too, a lot of it. How do you think they keep their server farms running? Energy is pretty much, in fact the key, to everything that Americans do for a living. It's the key to health care and agriculture and yes, media and travel and construction, entertainment—even finance, which is symbiotic with the real economy, depends in the end on energy, because you can't lend money to businesses if they no longer exist and if energy prices go up high enough, they don't exist.  

Given how central, very obviously central, energy is to everything that matters in America, it's hard to believe that the Biden administration would intentionally make energy much more expensive, because we know for a fact, having seen it repeatedly through history, that high energy prices will crush our economy faster even than the COVID lockdowns did. People will become poor. Some of them will die. That's not a guess. It will happen. Given all that, it's unimaginable that anyone but our enemies would want to raise our energy prices to the point where our economy collapses and yet that is exactly what the Biden administration has decided to do and to do it, they're using twin instruments of climate policy and their war against Russia. 

The effect? In a nation with the largest recoverable oil reserves on planet Earth, many Americans can no longer afford fossil fuels and once again, this is not an accident. It's not a natural cycle we're going through. Politicians and policymakers are doing it to us on purpose. Now that the midterm elections are over, the media can finally begin to cover the inevitable result of these policies. CNN, for example, just ran an article about Americans who are worried about freezing to death over the winter in America. 

One 63-year-old woman in Philadelphia called Charmaine Johnson said that she is torn between heating her home and buying food and of course, she's choosing food because she has no choice. ""It's miserable,"" she said. ""It's like living in an igloo."" Another man, a 67-year-old man called Tim Wiseley said he turns on his heat only when his teeth begin to chatter. ""You can't go food shopping and get oil. It's one or the other,"" he said. ""It's a horrible feeling. It's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone."" It's a feeling that Americans have not had in generations. 

These are American citizens living in a major American city that used to be considered first world and they can't afford heat and it's happening not just in Philadelphia, but everywhere. Average home heating prices went up 17% last year and they're up another 18% this year. Again, not organic. This is the result of policies from the Biden administration and its allies, not just in the Congress, but in think tanks across Washington and in the entire American news media. This did not happen by accident. As FOX Business has reported, once winter arrives, the problem is going to get much worse. 

We're riding around with Oil for Less and they say that their customers are struggling to keep up with these skyrocketing costs. Across the board, heating costs are expected to be high this winter. Heating oil in particular, up 68% year over year. Today, they filled up this tank with about $950 worth of home heating oil. A year ago, the same amount of oil would have cost them closer to $600. That's why the company tells me that some customers are just doing without. 

 People have gone without hot water and heat for a week just because they haven't had the money to call me and say, ""Hey, come on in."" 

They don't have the money for hot water or heat. Again, what country is this? Any country that can't provide hot water or heat in the winter isn't much of a country and again, it doesn't need to be this way because we have the largest recoverable oil reserves on the planet. What happens when energy costs continue to rise? Well, people run out of money and it doesn't take long. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, households are spending their cash reserves far faster than anyone all those economists projected, even as credit card debt reaches historic levels.  

If you're borrowing money for household expenses on your credit card at exorbitant rates, you're done. As Business Insider reported, ""Americans have already burned through a third of their pent up savings. That's nearly three times more than previously thought and signals spending will soon slow down."" 

Yeah, that's what happens when people run out of money. They stop spending it because they don't have it and then the consumer economy slows. When energy costs rise again (Just to be clear, because it's not sophisticated economics here) when they rise, so does the price of everything else. The first staple to rise in cost is the one that you have to have and that's food. Watch. 

On the menu this year for Thanksgiving: rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7% from last year and grocery prices are more than 12% higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17% year over year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 a pound. That's up from $1.74. Now, you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and higher fuel, feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43% more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 34%. Flour is up nearly 25%. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. 

Why is this happening? Well, you heard the reporter allude to it, but not really explain it. There are, of course, many factors, but there are two big factors that are driving this and the rising cost of everything around you and they are in order: global warming policy and the war in Ukraine. Now, as it always does, the left used people's best instincts, compassion and care for the planet, to subvert them into supporting these two lunatic policies. , but of course, neither one of these was about what they said it was about. Both of them were designed to spike energy costs, to increase the control of the people currently in charge, and to enrich their donors. 

If you wanted to fix this, the very first thing you would do if you wanted to help the American middle class, would be to force a cease fire in Ukraine. That would help the world and it would help our middle class. Then you would encourage more domestic energy production because we have the domestic energy. Then you would take a look at the trillions we have spent on renewable energy, solar panels, electric cars and wind power. This has made a small group of people incredibly rich, but it has put our grid in per and it has raised the cost of energy beyond the reach of middle-class Americans, but the Biden administration is not looking for solutions, just the opposite. They're looking for ways to squeeze a few more dollars out of an increasingly impoverished American middle class. 

According to Bloomberg, this week, ""the (IRS) says more auditors and upgraded technology could help raise as much as $1 trillion."" Oh, so you have less money and they plan to take more. If that's not an act of hostility, what is? It is an act of hostility. They don't like you and they're not hiding it, but big picture, every other major company in America is laying people off, but the IRS somehow, thanks to Joe Manchin, the moderate from West Virginia, the IRS somehow has the dough to hire 87,000 new employees and they're coming for you. They didn't hire those people by accident. They hired them to take more of your money.  

Businesses who have to forecast for a living have seen this coming and they're preparing to cut workers and so what this looks like, if you take three steps back, is an economic death spiral. Ahead of Christmas shopping season, when Amazon usually adds employees, Amazon is now laying off employees, a lot of them. 10,000 people were laid off from Amazon and the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, is actually encouraging people, his customers, not to buy his products. Watch this.  

The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy. People are slowing down. The probability, say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon. If you're an individual and you're thinking about buying a new, you know, large screen TV, maybe slow that down. Keep that cash. See what happens. Same thing with a refrigerator or a new car or whatever. This takes some risk off the table. If you're a small business, maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it can wait a little bit. Have some cash on hand. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business if we do get into even more serious economic problems. So, you got to play the probabilities a little bit. 

Wait, so the guy who sells big screen TVs on the internet is telling his customers, the source of his personal wealth, not to buy big screen TVs off the internet, really? That's how worried he is. He actually, for maybe the first time ever, is caring about you. That's quite amazing and he's not the only one. Bezos is not the only one who's worried that something bad is about to happen to our economy, the global economy. 

In October, the IMF warned that 2023 will bring a recession for most of the world. That same month, the CEO of JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank, Jamie Dimon, said a recession is almost certain in the coming months. So, what do you do to avert a disaster? Well, you probably can't stop it. You should know what its outlines will look at. Take a look at the housing market if you want to know. Home sales are at their lowest level in a decade.  

As the Fed raises interest rates to fight inflation, mortgages become too expensive, but if the Fed were to cut interest rates, home prices would go up along with . You see the problem here? We've reached the end of monetary policy ability to tweak our economy. So, faced with all of this, the one thing you'd hope is to have an administration that understands what the problem is. It might at least be interested in fixing it and taking care of the middle-class people who don't have a margin.  

People who are on the bottom, there are always the subject of our concern. What we do about the homeless? What do you with people who make $80,000 in the New York suburbs? Nobody cares about them. Here's Joe Biden explaining the straight face that actually everything's fine. His economic plan is working.  

Folks, my economic plan is showing results. People are starting to feel it. We're making progress on bringing down inflation without . Folks are seeing much needed break in inflation at the grocery store as we head in the holidays. 

That's pathetic and everyone knows it's pathetic and maybe the only upside of the Biden administration is that there's really no lying at this point. This isn't working. They just did better than expected in the midterms, the Democratic Party, unfortunately, but we're now facing the next election in 2024 and no sane person wants Joe Biden to run because everybody gets that this is unsustainable. Even the media gets that at this point. The question is: who replaces Joe Biden and what can that person do about the disaster that his administration?

769	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-shanghai-largest-prison-camp-human-history	2022-11-28 22:13:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Shanghai is the largest prison camp in human history | Fox News	"WARNING-Graphic footage: Fox News host Tucker Carlson rips the reaction from the Biden administration and the left to protests in China over the COVID-19 lockdowns on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Here's something that we didn't know, but now do. In the winter of 2020, Tony Fauci wanted to know how the Chinese Communist Party was responding to COVID. They had COVID. We had COVID. He'd want to see what they were doing, so we sent one of his deputies, a man called Clifford Lane, to China to find out, and Lane seemed stunned by what he saw there. 

Entire  had been quarantined, the whole city. Huge numbers of people were forcibly locked inside their own homes, in some cases to starve to death. Secret police cruised the streets forcing pedestrians into windowless vans for the crime of being outside. Household pets, dogs and cats, were declared unclean and beaten to death on the sidewalk. It was a hellish dystopian scene. 

So, Lane returned to the U.S. to tell Tony Fauci what he'd seen there. But Tony Fauci was not disgusted. He was not appalled by the human rights abuses that Clifford Lane had seen in China. According to a new report in The Epoch Times, based on depositions that emerged this month, Tony Fauci was envious. ""This is what we have to do"" in the U.S., Fauci told Wayne. 

So, it's very obvious now that from day one, China was the model that American officials, public health officials, were using to respond to COVID here and in fact, it still is the model. In fact, lockdowns are still happening in China. They never really ended and our public health officials have never stopped applauding those lockdowns.  

In April of this year, the Chinese government shut down Shanghai. Shanghai is the largest city in China. It's one of the biggest cities in the world. Shanghai has a population three times that of New York City, 25 million people. And all of those people, all 25 million, are now suffering indefinite lockdown. Shanghai is the largest prison camp in human history. 

So, why is the Chinese government doing this to its biggest city? Well, no honest person believes it has anything to do with public health because it doesn't probably. 

As of Sunday, yesterday, there were no  deaths reported in China, a nation of nearly a billion and a half people, not one COVID death. COVID is not a threat to the Chinese government. Political unrest, however, is a threat to the Chinese government. It always has been and that's the point. In China, as in the United States, COVID policy is not a public health matter. COVID policy is a tool of social control. COVID policy is a way for the people in charge to strip from their population the most basic civil liberties and remain in charge.  

That's very clear and that's exactly why our leaders support what's happening in China tonight, because they'd like to see it happen here, too. Hundreds of millions of people imprisoned across the country. That according to Harvard epidemiologist Eric Feigel-Ding is in ""everyone's interest."" Really? Well, here's what it looks like in China. 

Those are ad hoc COVID concentration camps, but there are new purpose built COVID concentration camps under construction right now, all throughout China. The city of Urumqi in the west of China has effectively been its own concentration camp for the last three months. It's been completely locked down. Residents have been unable to leave their homes for any reason, including to get food or medicine. Last week, a huge fire broke out at an apartment complex in that city. The government had sealed most of the doors in the building, including the exit to the outside. 

It took firemen more than three hours to control the blaze, and by that time, 10 people had roasted to death inside, including a three-year-old child. News of this fire spread throughout the country. In China, as in the United States, social media are censored by the people in charge who spend a lot of time and a lot of money there and here censoring it.

But in the end, it doesn't always work. Outrage has a way of getting through even the tightest filters. Protests began to form across China and those  have since grown to become the biggest challenge to communist rule since the Tiananmen Square massacre more than 30 years ago. Here's what the protests look like. 

We'll see where this goes, but again, these are the biggest protests that we know about to occur in China since 1989. But what's interesting is the reaction in this country. You watch those clips and you wonder: who could be rooting for the secret police in those clips? How could any decent person possibly be on the side of the Chinese government against the population of the country, the people against human rights, against human decency? 

Who could root for the tank against the lone brave man standing in front of it? And the answer is, unfortunately, some people could be on the side of the tank. Some people could support the oppressors against the oppressed, and in this country many people do. 

One of them is Tony Fauci. Here he is from yesterday as people were being killed in China for seeking the most basic human freedoms. Here is Fauci suggesting once again that the Chinese government is the model for our country and that's why we may need to close down our schools once more, even as COVID has become about as threatening as the annual flu. Watch.  

Could we close the schools again, fascism with a chirpy face? , says Fauci. . 

Over at The Washington Post, our internet reporter, Taylor Lorenz, was not so circumspect. She just came out and said it. Lorenz rightly praised what China is doing to its own people, unlike the United States, she said China isn't choosing to ""kill off millions of vulnerable people."" In other words, deporting your population to concentration camps is compassion. 

So, you have to ask, since China is the biggest country in the world, our main rival, largest economy, what does the Biden administration think of this? We must have a position on it. We have a State Department that exists to think up positions on things like this. So, what does the Biden administration think of what's happening in China? Apparently they agree with it. Today, a White House spokesman, John Kirby, the famous John Kirby, was asked for official reaction to the human rights protests raging today in China and here's what he said.  

What is the president's reaction when he hears protesters in China chant ""Freedom or Xi Jinping step down?""  

The president is not going to speak for protesters around the world. They're speaking for themselves.  

So, there's no reaction? 

These protesters are speaking for themselves. What we are doing is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest.  

The protesters are speaking for themselves? Haven't we spent $60 billion to prop up the corrupt government of Ukraine because they're on the side of freedom and democracy, even though it's not a free or democratic country? But that's the pretext. We're for freedom. Here you have people saying, ""Hey, I don't want to be thrown in a concentration camp or starve to death in my own apartment"" and the Biden administration can't even take their side.  

Really?. They don't speak for the U.S. government? The U.S. government doesn't stand for basic human rights anymore? Really, John Kirby? You should be ashamed of yourself. It's hard to believe that's real. It is real and the U.S. Congress has by and large adopted the same posture.  

Eric Swalwell spends a lot of his life yelping about human rights on Twitter (and yet he said nothing about what's happening tonight in China. We were not able to reach his former girlfriend, the Chinese spy Fang-Fang, for comment either, unfortunately, nor did we hear a word from the NBA commissioner. That would be Adam Silver. Now Adam Silver also spends a lot of time yelping about what an authoritarian country this is and threatening the people who live here with punishment. He has no problem threatening American voters in North Carolina, for example, or in Texas who wanted separate bathrooms for little girls. 

What does he think of killing people for wanting to leave their apartment? Or throwing people en masse into concentration camps? Well, we decided to find out. So, we emailed this office today to get his view of Chinese concentration camps. What does Adam Silver think of that, one of our premier moral voices? We didn't get a reply. Why is that? Maybe because he has made millions personally and the NBA itself makes billions of dollars in China. So, the NBA has no word to say about China throwing its population to the concentration camps, turning Shanghai into a prison and in fact, when you ask NBA coaches about civil rights abuses in China, what you get is a lecture about how we're worse. Watch.  

Oh. China commits genocide against Muslims and locks down a city of 25 million people, but we've got the Second Amendment and they're pretty much the same. That's the word from Steve Kerr, a very famous coach. 

These people are all in the take from China. The NBA is literally on the take from China and therefore, they will not say a single negative word about their masters. This is not an American League. These are not people were loyal to the United States. They despise the United States. They are on the payroll of China. That's true. How is it not true? 

So, they can't even criticize children burning alive in a high-rise apartment building because the doors have been nailed shut because of COVID, which doesn't actually pose a threat to anybody. 

The NBA has taken a pass. Eric Swalwell and his Chinese by girlfriend are taking a pass. The White House is taking a pass and the State Department. MSNBC is taking a pass. So, you have to ask: what about the basic ideas behind this? One of the most basic ideas in American life is that ""it's my body, my choice."" We have bodily autonomy in this country. Bodily autonomy! 

Bodily autonomy is central to the abortion debate. You can't force me to carry my child to term because it's my body. I control my body, not the government. In case you haven't heard that argument before, here it is. This is from recently. Watch. 

  

Protecting a woman's right to choose.  

Oh the right to choose, the right to choose abortion. What about the right to go outside or the right to choose whether to send your children to school or the right to choose what drugs go into your body or the right to choose not to be thrown into a concentration camp? Are those viable rights too? Are those also examples of bodily autonomy? 

Do the 1.5 billion people who live in China or the 340 million who live here, do they have bodily autonomy? No, they don't, according to those people. They don't care about bodily autonomy. They don't care about human rights. What they care about is controlling you forever, and that's true.

770	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-zelenskyy-yellen-bankman-fried-use-federal-investigations-celebrated	2022-11-30 21:33:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Zelenskyy, Yellen and Bankman-Fried could use federal investigations, but are celebrated | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the United States sending money to Ukraine on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We are going to start with a quiz. What do you have when you find Sam Bankman-Fried, Janet Yellen and  all together in one room? A federal grand jury proceeding? That would be a good guess. Sam Bankman-Fried seems to have committed the biggest financial fraud in history. As the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen bears direct responsibility for the destruction of the entire U.S. economy. President Zelenskyy, meanwhile, sits atop a money-laundering scheme so brazen that Democrats won't even allow it to be audited.  

So, yes, these are three people who could badly use a federal investigation, but they're not getting one. Instead, they're being celebrated, held up as uniquely fascinating people by The New York Times. In case you missed it, today was the annual DealBook Summit. That's a money-making event the newspaper advertises as a symposium with ""top business leaders."" Tickets went for $2,500 a piece. , Janet Yellen and Volodymyr Zelenskyy were all there, apparently in their capacity as top business leaders.  

""Thank you so very much!"" exclaimed the moderator, Andrew Ross Sorkin, when Sam Bankman-Fried finished speaking. ""Thank you, Sam Bankman-Fried, everybody,"" and with that, the audience applauded heartily. New York Times readers were clearly impressed by the Democratic mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried, who also happens to be one of the most prolific thieves of all time, but whatever. He seemed like a nice kid. It was a pretty amazing display, but what's most interesting about an event like this is not what it tells us about the guests — at some point, history will render its judgment about them — but what it tells us about the people who invited the guests. 

If it's OK to treat Sam Bankman-Fried like just another naughty celebrity — ""Sam Bankman-Fried, everybody, applause, applause!"" — if you can do that, then who's off limits? Who's beyond the pale? Well, as it happens, The New York Times has spent the last few days telling us, delivering yet another hyperventilating lecture about who we're allowed to associate with and who we must avoid at all costs, and it really depends on political loyalty. 

  

Some people, The New York Times has explained, have views that are so reprehensible these people are physically off limits. You cannot be in the same room with people like that. You can't talk to them. You can't ask them questions. Their opinions are like smallpox: communicable and deadly. These are the thought criminals and thought crimes are the only crimes that matter. Other crimes? Not such a big deal. Murder and rape and carjacking? As The New York Times has often told us, people who do those things are the victims of your racism, so they deserve compassion. 

So, by the way, do good liberals who stray outside the lines. Good liberals can always be forgiven, even when the things they've done are objectively very, very bad, like tanking the U.S. economy or stealing billions from investors and using it to buy Bahamian real estate or bringing the entire world to the brink of nuclear war and getting rich while you do it. Liberals can still do these things and you can still heartily applaud them because in the end, you know their hearts are in the right place. They believe the right things.  

With that in mind, it probably is not a surprise that no one at The New York Times bothered to ask Zelenskyy today where exactly all the money has gone. No one demanded an accounting of the billions of your tax dollars that seem to have disappeared into the pockets of Ukrainian oligarchs in tracksuits because asking would have been rude. He was our guest. So instead, The New York Times gave Zelenskyy an opportunity to demand much more of your money, which of course, he promptly took. 

""OK, so support me or Putin's going to invade Atlanta and by the way, you have no choice, because if you object to sending billions more to the very people who gave a no-show job to Hunter Biden, you're a bad person. You don't care about Ukrainian lives. You are a moral monster."" Now moral blackmail this crude does not typically work because nobody with self-respect would stand for it. What? ""Settle down, son. Get the Germans to pay for it. It's their continent."" That's what a normal person would say, someone who had self-respect. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas has no self-respect so he folded immediately and that matters because McCaul is the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  

Just in case that you imagine that throwing out Nancy Pelosi and electing a Republican Congress, a huge victory, would mean that somebody would push back against Joe Biden's lunatic and completely anti-American foreign policy priorities, oh, you were mistaken, because Michael McCaul just informed us that because we're good people and so is Zelenskyy, we're going to be sending Mr. Zelenskyy and his pals in tracksuits billions more of your money. 

The U.S. Military — not , our military, the one that's supposed to protect our country — is running out of equipment and manpower, but just so we're all clear about what Michael McCaul's priorities are, we're sending advanced weapons systems, yet more of them to Ukraine, and that's in addition to what we've already sent, which is bigger than the entire Russian military budget.  

If that's not insulting enough — and of course, the point of this is to insult you and to degrade you and to make you fully aware that your country's interests come last because you come last on the list of priorities — they're going farther than that. We've also decided to pay Ukraine's energy bills. Now, it's kind of odd that we're doing that at a time when we have our first real energy crisis since the mid-1970s, a manufactured crisis, but a crisis nevertheless, a crisis that is causing Americans to freeze in their homes because they can't afford heating oil. That means it's a perfect time to send energy to our friends in Ukraine and the whole region. Here's Tony Blinken.  

Why is this continuing when, of course, Joe Biden could call Zelenskyy, who effectively works for him, I mean, a close family connection here, of course. His son worked in Ukraine. He could call Zelenskyy and say, you know, ""No más, get the money from Europe or let's wrap this thing up. People are dying. The rebuilding costs of this country are beyond what we can pay. This is really a dead end. Let's come to a settlement."" And of course, that could happen in about a week if they wanted it to, but they don't want that. They want the war to keep going. Why is that? Oh, because everyone's getting rich.  

The one thing you're not allowed to say is that, ""Hey, maybe we should stop this war,"" because, of course, the cash spigot would stop flowing and that's why at the DealBook Summit, the top business leader, Zelenskyy — in fact, he really is a top business leader if you want to be honest about it — went after Elon Musk because Elon Musk suggested maybe we should get a peace deal. 

Oh, all perfectly reasonable. ""Can't have peace, send more billions."" So, it's interesting. These last few days have been like the few days before that. There's been a lot of moral outrage in Washington about bad ideas and of course, some ideas are bad on both sides for sure, but ideas aren't criminal. Actions are criminal and as always, the real criminals are getting away with it and getting richer in the process.

Tonight, we're going to start with a confession. For all the time that we spend yapping about the  and have for the past two years, it's striking how little we really know about what goes on there. Who exactly works for Joe Biden? What do they do all day? What stage of gender transition are they in? 

Those are all fair and necessary questions. So tonight, in attempt to answer them, we'd like to roll out the first installment in a regular educational feature we're calling ""Who runs your government?"" Tonight's focus: Sam Brinton. 

Sam Brinton is one of the people who runs your government. Brinton is a senior official at the Department of Energy. His job is to oversee this country's nuclear waste disposal. Brinton makes sure that spent fuel rods are safely stored. That's a bigger responsibility than you might know. Most people assume that once a rod is spent, you can ignore it and move on to something else. Maybe take your dog to the park, but that's not true. 

The spent rods are often the hardest to deal with and Sam Brinton is an expert on this topic, but that's not all he is. Brinton is also nonbinary, gender fluid and possibly two-spirit. That's his real superpower and it's why Joe Biden hired him for such a sensitive job. Here's Brinton in 2019 in a clip the White House Personnel Office clearly reviewed before bringing him aboard. 

Now, traditionally, there haven't been a lot of guys at the Energy Department whose stilettos click on marble floors. So, from the beginning, you knew that San Brinton's portfolio would extend far beyond nuclear waste and indeed it does. When there's a crisis in the Biden White House, Sam Brinton is the man/woman they turned to.  

On September 16 of this year, there was a crisis in the White House. Ron DeSantis had just airlifted a group of illegal aliens from Latin America onto the idyllic Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard. The problem for the  was pretty obvious. How do you publicly support open borders without offending your own high dollar donors, many of whom vacation on Martha's Vineyard and don't want to share their beaches with Brazilians who have only high school degrees? That's a tough one, but Sam Brinton had a plan.  

Like the OSS in wartime France, he sketched out a complex diversionary operation designed to rescue the White House from this disaster. Brinton traveled incognito to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, and he headed for the baggage claim. There he found the enemy's Achilles heel. He found a $2,000 roller bag unguarded and stuffed with fashionable women's clothing. 

With maximum stealth, Sam Brinton then flew the clothes back to HQ in Washington and added them to his own wardrobe. The operation was a success. Sam Brinton's spunky new outfit sent shockwaves through the patriarchy. Clicking in high heels were one thing, but a sequined taffeta halter top? There was no stopping him or the administration he worked for. With his new clothes, Brinton flew to Los Angeles, where he headlined a seminar on his two areas of demonstrated expertise: the hard sciences and sexual bondage.  

The seminar was called ""Spanking from Calculus to Chemistry"" and it promised to explain why, ""physics is a pivotal part of the kink experience."" Brinton's alma mater, M.I.T., was deeply impressed. The school posted a glowing profile of its kink-savvy graduate on its website, complete with a picture of Sam Brinton wearing clothes that appeared to be taken from the roller bag at the Minneapolis airport. , declared M.I.T., which is a university, . 

Unfortunately, local police had a different view of Sam Brinton. As it turns out, there are surveillance cameras in the Minneapolis airport and those cameras captured Brinton removing the I.D. tags from the roller bag on the carousel. This was proof that it wasn't a mix-up. Sam Brinton stole some lady’s dresses and underwear and then traveled around the country wearing them. That's a crime, even in 2022.

 Police arrested Brinton and they charged him with felony theft. Going forward, at some point, it looks like somebody else is going to have to deal with America's spent fuel rods. Thankfully, the White House already has a candidate in mind. That would be Dylan Mulvaney, TikTok star and adviser to the president of the United States. Department of Energy, meet your latest nuclear waste engineer.  

All people use tampons, not just women,"" says Dylan Mulvaney. Now, we don't know if Dylan Mulvaney spelled that out in detail for the president of the United States when he and Biden met recently in the White House as they did, but we can tell you what Dylan Mulvaney has just said is science, pure 200-proof, make-your-eyes-water, scientific fact, the kind you want a shot of early in the morning after a rough night. No mixers, thanks.  

I'll take my science straight up and wipe my mouth on my sleeve and that's what it's like every day at the White House under Joe Biden, a raging, nonstop science party. As Ms.  explained to an awestruck press corps the other day, sometimes after his nap, Joe Biden will go ahead and meet with science people. That's how he relaxes, with top scientists. Watch.  

Joe Biden met with not one, not two, but three winners of the Nobel Prize. Now, to be clear, it wasn't the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a trademarked brand. It's slightly different in the same way that that $12 handbag you bought on Canal Street wasn't, strictly speaking, made by Louis Vuitton, but whatever. It was a decent bag and you got a good price on it and it's the same with the Nobel Prize. It's not the Nobel Prize, but it is noble. It's a noble prize. That's how it got its name. Ask Karine Jean-Pierre. She knows.  

Now at this point, you may have concluded – this was not our intention, we're just reporting the facts here – but you may have decided, based on the evidence, that a lot of the people who run your government under Joe Biden are stupid and silly and have weird personal lives. And of course, that's true, but it's not the whole story.  

A lot of them are also megalomaniacs who have no idea how stupid and silly they are. So, for government employees in that category, Kamala Harris will always be an inspiration living proof that inflated self-esteem and an affair with Willie Brown can literally catapult you to the top and the trick here is endurance. No matter how embarrassing you may be, you just keep going. That's the lesson of Kamala and here she is in the Philippines just last week proving it. 

""Dance, peasants, dance! Dance for me. Show me the dance."" It works. That's the vice president of the United States commanding peasants to dance for er. It always works. 

It's working for Janet Yellen. Janet Yellen is Joe Biden's treasury secretary, but she's more than that. She has a past. If the American economy looks a little precarious right now, if you sense maybe we're headed for a fall in a big way, well, that's in part because of Janet Yellen and her thoroughly and completely irresponsible behavior as the chair of the Federal Reserve. 

Janet Yellen has personally done more than maybe any living American to bring our country steep inflation and yet another housing bubble which is apparently about to burst, taking a lot of our economy with it. Janet Yellen did that by printing tons of cheap money and then getting kickbacks in the form of speaking fees from the Wall Street banks. That happened, and you can look it up and find for yourself that it happened.

But here's the key. Janet Yellen has no intention of admitting that it happened and as a Biden White House official, she doesn't have to admit it. You know what she can do? She can blame the whole thing on you, peasant, and last night, she did. Watch. 

Oh, they splurged on grills. It had nothing to do with the fact that I ran the Fed, which controls our money supply and therefore controls our economy at the deepest level and I printed so much money that it's not worth anything anymore and that's why our economy is about to blow up, but that's not what did it. 

You bought a grill. Next time. Don't do that. Dance, peasant. Dance.

772	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-twitters-censorship-hunter-biden-story	2022-12-02 22:04:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Behind Twitter's censorship of the Hunter Biden story | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to the bombshell report Elon Musk released about Twitter's censorship of the Hunter Biden story on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

One of the most extraordinary moments in the history of social media is unfolding right now as we speak and it began when Elon Musk took control of Twitter. When he bought the company, he promised to reveal its corruption, the extent to which Twitter had engaged in politically motivated censorship, including the unlawful, the illegal censorship, of American citizens at the direction of the U.S. government.  

Well, tonight, less than an hour ago, Musk began to make good on that promise. Twitter shared a trove of internal documents with Matt Taibbi of Substack. Those documents are coming out again as we speak, and what they have proved so far is very serious. Those documents show a systemic violation of the first amendment, the largest example of that in modern history.  

These documents show that, among other things, political officials in the Democratic National Committee were directing censorship at Twitter ahead of the 2020 election. One Twitter official wrote on October 24, 2020, that he had received, ""an additional report from the DNC."" So, the DNC was telling Twitter what to pull off of the site and Twitter was complying. Next morning, to prove it, a Twitter official confirmed the post had been deleted. ""I grabbed the first one,"" that Twitter employee wrote. 

Twitter was also following instructions directly from the Biden campaign in the final days of the presidential campaign. One of the documents proves that officials on the Biden team routinely directed Twitter to remove posts that reflected poorly on Joe Biden. ""More to review from the Biden team,"" read one internal email from a Twitter employee just days before the 2020 election. That email included a list of several Twitter accounts that have criticized Joe Biden. The reply? ""Handled. We just checked."" Now those accounts remain suspended today.  

Twitter was permanently censoring users at the request of the DNC and the Biden campaign. That is new. Many suspected it. Now, it has been absolutely confirmed by internal documents and, of course, the New York Post Twitter account was banned. Why? Because they had a story that might have changed the outcome of the 2020 election and Twitter knew that perfectly well. 

They had accurate information about Hunter Biden's laptop. The Post reporting directly implicated Joe Biden and the Biden family in an ongoing scheme to sell influence to leverage Biden's job as a government official to sell the prestige and the power of the U.S. government to China and Ukraine.  

That scheme, that ongoing scheme that unfolded over years, made the Biden family millions of dollars. 10% of that money was reserved, as you know, for ""The Big Guy,"" meaning Joe Biden. That was information that might have changed the outcome of the election and that is precisely why Twitter prevented its users from reading it. Twitter went so far as to block its users from privately sharing the New York Post story on Twitter direct message. Anyone attempting to share the story about Hunter Biden's laptop was told it was unsafe. 

Now that measure preventing users from sharing information privately is something that Twitter reserves in normal circumstances only in the most extreme cases, Taibbi writes, like stopping the transmission of child pornography. But in this case, information that might have hurt Joe Biden's chances of becoming president were invoked and they were applied even to the sitting president's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. 

Internally, Taibbi writes, ""The decision was made at the highest levels of the company, but without the knowledge of CEO Jack Dorsey, with former head of legal policy and Trust, Vijaya Gadde playing a key role."" All suspected, now confirmed. 

Now in public, Twitter and its many allies in the rest of the media claimed that the New York Post story violated the hacked materials policy that Twitter had on its books, but internally at Twitter, everyone understood that was just a pretext. That laptop had not been hacked and it wasn't of Russian origin. By the way. As of right now, (It's 8:04 eastern time) there is no evidence in this ongoing thread from Matt Taibbi that Twitter had received confirmation from the U.S. government even that the laptop was fake or from Russia. They just made it up. 

According to Taibbi, one official admitted that ""hacking was the excuse, but within a few hours, pretty much everyone at Twitter realized that wasn't going to hold, but no one had the guts to reverse it."" One communications official at Twitter, Trenton Kennedy, wrote this: ""I'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this"" (the laptop story) ""as unsafe."" 

Twitter's former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, explained that Twitter had to censor the story so that Donald Trump would not be re-elected president. ""The policy basis is hacked material, though, as discussed, this is an emerging situation where the facts remain unclear given the SEVERE risks here and the lessons of 2016,"" (meaning Trump could get elected) ""we're erring on the side of including a warning and preventing this content from being amplified."" 

This played out to some extent in public. Now we know what was happening within Twitter, but the whole country knew that something was being censored. A lot of people couldn't read it, but it was widely known that Twitter was censoring this and so, by the way, were many other news organizations. And at that time, Twitter received a communication from a consultant in Washington who had taken an informal poll of members of Congress, Democrats, and the message this person sent to Twitter was Democrats in Congress support the censorship. We're quoting: ""They don't think the First Amendment is absolute."" Huh?  

In other words, sitting members of Congress were encouraging censorship to affect the outcome of a presidential election. That is illegal. It is effectively election rigging, and it is a direct attack on our Bill of Rights by people who have sworn to uphold the Bill of Rights. You’ve got to hope someone will be held accountable for this. 

Back to the documents. Within Twitter, others, presumably all voting Democrats, but some with some integrity, kept raising questions about this. Former vice president of global communications, Brandon Borrman, asked, ""Can we truthfully claim this is part of the policy?""  

In other words, is this consistent with the rules? Then the general counsel of Twitter, Jim Baker – that would be the former FBI general counsel who was directly involved in the FBI's interview with Michael Flynn when his life was destroyed for political reasons – signed off on the continued censorship. The former FBI official signed off. ""Caution is warranted,"" said Baker. Let's hope we hear from Mr. Baker in a congressional hearing very soon.  

Throughout all of this, the record shows, at least as of right now, only one elected official in the entire Democratic Party, that would be Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, a Democrat, voicing any concern at all. So, Khanna reached out to Vijaya Gadde and here's what he wrote: ""This seems to be a violation of the First Amendment principles... I say this as a total Biden partisan."" But he was completely blown off by Vijaya Gadde. 

By the way, good for him. He's a liberal, too, but apparently sort of a real one. Within days, someone called Carl Szabo with the research firm NetChoice, advised Twitter executives that on Capitol Hill, Democrats are very happy with this. They supported the censorship. 

So as we said, this thread exposing internal documents from Twitter as transcribed with commentary by Matt Taibbi is still ongoing. It is still flowing forth as we speak. We're bringing you information as it comes.

773	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-this-how-system-supposed-work	2022-12-05 22:48:00	TUCKER CARLSON: This isn't how our system is supposed to work | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson breaks down what was really learned from Elon Musk's 'Twitter Files' on the Hunter Biden laptop story on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

The main thing that we learned last Friday night with the release of those previously , is not that social media companies censor conservatives. Obviously, we knew that. No one's surprised to have it confirmed. No one denied it in the first place. No. 

What we learned on Friday is that  works aggressively and in secret with government agencies to subvert the outcome of what the rest of us assumed were free and fair elections. During the 2020 election, Twitter did this with the help of the FBI, committing censorship on behalf of one candidate while working to hurt the other candidate. It is hard to imagine a more brazen attack on our democracy than this. This is not how our system is supposed to work. In fact, it's illegal. 

What Twitter did is a  as well as of established campaign finance law. They never declared those contributions to the Biden campaign. That's a crime.

Thanks to the reporting of Matt Taibbi, who received access to these documents from Twitter's new owner, , we know that this happened. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's a fact. But you wouldn't know what happened if you got your news from legacy media outlets in the US. In the days since Taibbi's jaw-dropping scoops, none of them have followed up on the story. Instead, he dismissed the story is entirely normal. 

Of course, the FBI was working secretly with Twitter and the Biden campaign to control your brain by limiting your access to factual information. That's how elections work. Or they're attacking Matt Taibbi personally for daring to write the story.

So the same people who spent weeks defending billionaire con artist Sam Bankman-Fried, who has as of tonight, you'll be happy to know was still in the Bahamas, unindicted. Those same people are telling you that the real criminal here is the guy who's uncovering illegal censorship in a presidential campaign. It's hard to believe they're saying that. Oh, but they are. Here's a selection: 

There's just so much there. Al Sharpton teaming up with the former  aide to tell you censorship is good. The first lady saying this Ukrainian company allegedly paid Hunter Biden when there's no allegedly about it. Everyone involved has already admitted it. And then, best of all, Ali Velshi. ""We in the cable business."" Ali Velshi has never been in the news business. People in the news business cover the news. Propagandists censor and distort the news. And that's what you're watching there.

Thankfully, as always, their propaganda is crude and not very effective, mostly because it's so unbelievably not believable. Censorship, explains Brandy Zadrozny, like a slightly annoyed kindergarten teacher, censorship is called ""content moderation."" When we hide facts from you that you need in order to cast an informed vote in a presidential election that's, quote, ""safe and healthy."" Hiding facts from you is safe and healthy. Is there anyone who actually believes that?

Well, judging by NBC's tanking ratings, not many people actually do believe that. But they're saying it anyway. Here's Michael Steele of MSNBC, the former RNC chairman, by the way, letting you know that actually revealing the mechanics of censorship is itself an attack on free speech. 

So any day you get to see Michael Steele misuse the words juxtaposition, obviously, it's a good day. But the payoff really was his little lecture on constitutional law, the essential tenant of free speech, Michael Steele just told you. The essential tenet is that you, as an American citizen, are never allowed to say things that other people object to. Okay, Michael Steele. If you get a chance, let us know what constitution you've been reading. The one that we have here in the US is pretty clear. 

In the United States, you get to say, as an American citizen, what you believe. Period. And under no circumstances ever may the government infringe on that right. Period. Again, that's the First Amendment. And thanks to ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed on Friday night, we know the First Amendment has been violated more profoundly than at any time in our lives. Miranda Devine of The New York Post has just reported the FBI met ""weekly"" with Twitter executives in the months before the 2020 election. And in those meetings, the FBI specifically warned about hack and leak operations by state actors that would involve Hunter Biden and would, ""likely come out in October.""

Oh. We know that because it appeared in a sworn deposition from Twitter's former chief censor, Yoel Roth, signed in 2020. It wasn't just Twitter, by the way. It was also Facebook. The FBI was holding similar meetings with Facebook, which also, not surprisingly, in fact as a direct result of those meetings, censored the Hunter Biden story. Watch.

So this is a stop the presses story. The FBI is the largest and most powerful domestic law enforcement agency in the world. It can't become a secret police force. If it does, this is no longer a free country and it's no better than, say, Russia under Putin. Or any authoritarian state. It is an authoritarian state, by definition, if the largest domestic law enforcement agency starts to play in domestic politics. But they are, and we know that, and no one's saying anything about it. And that's very strange.

We do know that the Twitter executive who went to those meetings, the meetings with the FBI, was a man called Yoel Roth. Now, if you think about it, it was never clear what Yoel Roth was doing at Twitter in the first place. Yoel Roth had no technical expertize of any kind, didn't know anything about hacking, foreign affairs, didn't know anything about Russia. 

What does he know about? Well, Yoel Roth received a Ph.D. in the study of Grindr, the gay sex hookup app from a place called UPenn, the University of Pennsylvania, purportedly an Ivy League school you should be impressed by.

We're not making this up by the way. Grindr appears more than 800 times in his research. And UPenn, gave him a Ph.D. for that. So whatever you think of that, how did that get Yoel Roth into the position that he occupied at Twitter where he was in charge of what you were allowed to say and think. Well, the one qualification we know Yoel Roth did have is he does not believe in free speech, period. And he made that very clear in an interview last week.

It's so great. It's ""life-threatening"" to tell jokes. It's life-threatening. What's interesting about speech codes always and everywhere, and specifically the speech codes that Yoel Roth has devoted his life, over the past several years, to uphold is that they change constantly, and you never know when they change or on what grounds they change. They just change. And you're usually caught in the crossfire. And you're busted for saying something you didn't even know you weren't allowed to say.

Probably the greatest example of this is that Yoel Roth, himself, once attacked trans people on Twitter. He called them ""trannies."" Whoa. Thereby threatening their lives. Quote,""It wouldn't be a trip to New York without at least one big scary tranny."" That's an actual tweet from Yoel Roth, the kind of tweet that if you wrote it, he'd call the FBI. 

So now Yoel Roth has to pretend to be offended by all of this. Why? Because his purported offense, the terror he feels, gives him a pretext to censure you on behalf of the most powerful people in the world. That's how that works.

So people with the most power claim they're defending the people with the least power in order to crush you. That's exactly the way it always works. By the way, Yoel Roth has deleted his old tranny tweets. And now he's just shocked. He's just shocked by the Babylon Bee. 

But it's not just Yoel Roth. Vijaya Gadde was his boss. Gadde, according to Matt Taibbi's reporting, oversaw the censorship of the New York Post's reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop. And Gadde was later rewarded for that by the Biden administration. For real. 

The Biden administration appointed the person who effectively allowed Joe Biden to get elected President by censoring criticism of his business deals,in  which he took money from China. She was rewarded by getting an advisory role on CISA. That would be the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Ever heard of it? Oh well, it has a big effect on your life. It's a division of DHS, by the way. It's the censorship arm of the federal government. 

How can this even exist? Our First Amendment specifically prohibits that. Why is there no court case on this? Why are people standing by and putting up with it? We know that its reach is extensive. New documents revealed in Missouri's ongoing lawsuit against Big Tech revealed just how aggressive the censorship that CISA practices is. So effectively, they're a hotline that allows the government to pressure the Big Tech companies to censor political opposition.

On October 29, 2020, for example, an official with the Washington Secretary of State's office wrote to CISA, quote, ""I wanted to flag two tweets with possible misinformation about the election."" Misinformation about the election. Now, remember, misinformation is a new word. It's been around the intel world for a long time, but it's never been used in common conversation until recently.

And the distinction between misinformation and lying is that misinformation can be true. It doesn't have to be untrue to be censored. So it used to be truth is a defense. If you're telling the truth, you can say it. Not anymore. With mis and disinformation, if I don't like it, if I'm in power, I can censor you.

So one of the offending tweets that this political official in Washington state was upset about was a reference to an election dispute in Washington State's 2004 gubernatorial election, which played out in the courts. And ultimately Democrats won that court battle. 

The tweet read, ""Washington State in 2004 judges ignored the real count and rewarded the Democrats. Another tweet from the same account read simply, ""Ballots can appear whenever from whomever."" Now, you could agree or disagree with those tweets. They seem true. But in any case, they're opinions, they're a political take. And you see tweets like that all the time on Twitter because this is a free country or was.

But what happened next is shocking and it's amazing that anyone would defend it. The federal government shut down those opinions. Within minutes, CISA flagged the tweets to several DHS accounts. These are people with guns. Then CISA sent the report directly to Twitter. ""Please see the report below from Washington,"" CISA wrote. And the tweets, of course, were censored. The government got a random Twitter user with a small following shut down because they didn't like his or her views on the 2004 election in Washington State because they criticized Democrats. The government. 

This is not a close call. This is a violation of the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights, to the centerpiece of our Constitution. And it's happening constantly. States reported posts they didn't like and CISA, an arm of DHS, guys with guns, got Twitter to censor it. Kentucky's secretary of state did this all, all the time. The documents show that. So did Colorado's. In fact, Colorado reported several political parody accounts to DHS, which then alerted Twitter, and all of them were pulled off.

They were all parodies, by the way. Even if they weren't parodies, it doesn't matter. But they were, in fact, jokes. You're seeing one of them on your screen right now. ""Smoke weed every day,"" the account's bio reads. ""The official (unofficial) Twitter account of the state of Colorado."" 

But Twitter took the DHS complaint seriously. Why wouldn't they? And censored the accounts. Quote, ""We will escalate,"" Twitter wrote. At the beginning of the election cycle in 2021, staffers for the Secretary of State of Arizona -- ordered by gubernatorial candidate and then-secretary of state Katie Hobbs -- also directed censorship through CISA.

""I am flagging this Twitter account for your review,"" wrote someone in Hobbs's account to the Center for Internet Security. CISA was later cc'd on the email. Why? Well, according to Hobbs's office, the tweets were ""an attempt to further undermine confidence in the election institution in Arizona."" Okay. So you're not allowed not to have confidence in elections. Really?

This is the state where the biggest county took more than a week to count the ballots. And the printers didn't work on Election Day, though they worked the day before. But you're supposed to have total confidence. In fact, you're commanded to. And if you don't have confidence, you'll be punished. The email concluded, quote, ""Thank you for your consideration in reviewing this matter for action."" And of course, Twitter soon censored them. ""Thank you. We will escalate,"" Twitter replied.

For the fifth time, this isn't just offensive. This is illegal. This is a crime. A very serious crime. A crime against our democracy, not trespassing in the Capitol or gazing upon Nancy Pelosi's desk, influencing the outcome of elections. It's beyond belief. It's also very common, much more common than anyone thought.

This weekend, Elon Musk suggested that Twitter interfered abroad, too. They do it here. Why wouldn't they do it in other countries? Musk suggested they interfered in the Brazilian elections. ""I'm seeing a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election,"" he tweeted the other day. ""If those tweets are accurate, it's possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates."" Okay.

I mean it's possible? If that happened, can you imagine the people lecturing you everyday about democracy or subverting democracy in foreign countries, in Brazil, probably in Hungary, probably in El Salvador, in any regime that they don't like. Not because those regimes pose a threat to the United States, because they just don't like the cut of their jib. So what we're learning about state interference in democratic elections all over the world has long been suspected. Now it's confirmed. And there's a lot more coming, from Matt Taibbi and others.

774	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-republicans-colluding-allow-border-crisis-continue	2022-12-06 23:34:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Republicans are colluding to allow border crisis to continue | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to a possible mass amnesty immigration deal ahead of the new Congress and says our leaders are committing immigration fraud on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

It's funny about profound change. You always imagine when things change radically, they're going to be troops in the streets, and you're going to know this is the pivot point, this is the revolution. But that's most of the time not what actually happens. Usually there's some guy in a suit and tie speaking soothing words, and you don't even know that everything is changing when it is.

That's the case with what happened on June 15, 2012, a decade ago. On that day,  walked into the Rose Garden and announced, full of self-confidence and coolness. Obama announced that his administration decided actually not to deport millions of . Henceforth, Barack Obama explained, these millions of people would no longer be identified, in fact, as ""illegal aliens"" or even breakers of federal law, which everyone had assumed they were. No. Going forward, they would be called ""Dreamers."" So illegal aliens are bad, of course, but Dreamers are good.

And because to control language is to control reality, these  would no longer be subject to federal law. They'd be above federal law because you can't ban a dream. That's effectively the case that Obama made. Now, what Obama did that day was, strictly speaking, illegal. Several courts later ruled that it's illegal, obviously. Only kings and legislatures get to change the law. American presidents do not have that power and never have. 

But no one stopped Barack Obama from doing this, so he did it anyway. And the effect, the intended effect, was immediate. Foreign nationals flooded into the United States.

Over the decade before Obama's Dreamer Rose Garden announcement, about 8000 unaccompanied minors showed up at the U.S. border every year. After Obama redefined lawbreakers as Dreamers, more than 24,000 showed up. And that's accelerated. Under Joe Biden, the number has grown to 130,000 per year. 

Now, it's interesting where these people are coming from. They're not coming from a contiguous nation, Mexico. No. They're coming from much farther away. According to the numbers from HHS, 32% of unaccompanied migrants you're seeing are from Honduras. 47% are from Guatemala. Look at a map. 13% are from El Salvador. Those are far away. Those are in Central America. Just 1% are coming from Mexico.

What's going on here exactly? Well, mostly, they are teenagers. The overwhelming majority are over the age of 14. They're not little kids. And again, this is accelerating. And it didn't stop during the last administration. The Trump administration didn't stop it. Under immediate pressure, that administration agreed to end so-called family separations at the border. Really, they're inhumane. 

But the fact is, family separations happen all the time to American citizens. If you commit a crime, you're going to be separated from your kids. And NBC News won't care at all, much less report it. But illegal aliens, Dreamers, shouldn't be forced to face these consequences, explained The New York Times. So now they're not forced to because they're Dreamers. So naturally, the surge continued.

But why? Why? Typically a country calculates its immigration levels based on its internal needs. So all throughout American history, there have been periods where, ""Oh, we need people to do this or that. Let's import those people."" But based on the state of the US economy in 2022, these are not the people you would import if you cared about your country. Almost none of the arrivals have a meaningful education. They're not trained to participate in the emerging economy you hear so much about STEM. It plays no role in this. There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration. 

And of course, immigration destabilizes your society. It makes it far less cohesive. That's always true. It doesn't matter where they're coming from. If you have a ton of new people, you're less cohesive.

So why are they coming? There's only one reason. Because the Democratic Party wants new voters, period. That's not a racist conspiracy. No, it's not. It's true. And we know that it's true not because we heard on Alex Jones, but because leading Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years. And here's the latest example. Here is , the head Democrat in the US Senate last month.

Everything about that was a lie. We need workers. Really? They're what, 7 million American-born men who have dropped out of the workforce, workforce age, who just aren't working or on the Internet all day? Does anyone care? No. Just replace them. Americans aren't reproducing. Really? Why? Well, because the economy has changed. And what's their answer to that? The Democratic Party's answer. Well the Treasury Secretary told us a month and a half ago. She said, ""If you're worried about the economy, have an abortion."" People who want to have kids increasingly can't. Why is that? Well, because the food supply and the air and water have been poisoned and sperm counts are half what they were a few decades ago. So these are specific problems that have prevented millions of Americans from having families from reproducing, as Chuck Schumer just said. And you could fix them if you tried. But they're not trying.

Instead, the solution is to replace the people who aren't reproducing with millions of new people from other countries. That's not a racist conspiracy theory. Chuck Schumer just said it. However many undocumented there are here, Schumer added. 

So as a political matter, what is this? Well, you're hearing a lot about threats to democracy. This is an actual threat to democracy. This is an actual effort to disenfranchize American voters. It's an attempt to replace their vote with a new electorate. So this is incredibly dark, and it's not a referendum on the people coming here, most of whom are well, they want to be here. So that says something good about them. No. 

This is a measure of the intent of the people in charge, the malice behind what they're doing. So it's hard to believe this could become law. This could be codified since Republicans just took over the House. Oh, but it could be in the lame duck session, which does not represent the recently expressed will of voters last month. A month ago, voters cast their ballots and they said we would like a Republican House and they got one. But that's all about to be short-circuited.

New reporting suggests that Democrats and several Republicans are working on a deal to pass mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens before the new Congress can be seated. Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House Speaker, has promised not to hold a vote for any immigration bill until the border is secure because it would be insane to do otherwise. And yet, several Republican members of the Senate are trying to pass a mass amnesty before the new Republican Congress is seated next month. Leading that effort, he should become famous for this, is Thom Tillis, the Republican senator of North Carolina, joined by Democrat Kirsten Sinema of Arizona. 

According to Axios, between 10 and 12 Republican senators could join this plan, and that would include names you're probably familiar with: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah. And as we said, Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Then several retiring senators -- Rob Portman, Roy Blunt, Richard Burr -- are also being courted to support the bill.

Imagine, someone who's on his way out of Congress, in days, will be codifying a law that will change the country forever. So how are they justifying this? Well, clearly, their donors want it right, because cheap labor is always the justification for everything. It's a shortsighted view. 

Thom Tillis is saying this is okay because it will only offer amnesty to the Dreamers, Barack Obama's Dreamers. Illegal migrants supposedly came to this country as young people. So by offering  to Dreamers, what will happen next? Well, what happened last time? The U.S. Congress will incentivize more foreign nationals to flood into the country. And that's the whole point of it. It's why Obama did it a decade ago.

So what will happen to our economy, which is on the verge of a real downturn? Everyone knows that. Well, let's see. The average Dreamer is 28-years old. The average income, the median income of Dreamers is $26,000. That's far lower than the median income of Americans. So that's not an attack on anybody. It's only a simple observation. If the country is getting poorer, you probably don't want a lot more poverty imported. 

Again, why is that untrue? Well, it is true, and everyone knows it's true. And no one has the brass to say it out loud. But it's real. By the way, we have no idea how many dreamers or other illegal aliens are in this country. The Biden administration has been working with the government of Mexico to hide those numbers for two years now from the public. Well, so much for democracy. The Center for Immigration Studies just exposed this in one of the most important investigations from the border in a long time. Watch.

So that was -- what's the word for that -- oh, that would be immigration fraud being committed by the Biden administration. Hiding the numbers so you don't realize how many people are coming into your country illegally. You have no role in this whatsoever. Now, keep that in mind when you learn that the Thom Tillis lame duck bill will include, quote, ""$25 to $40 billion for border security."" That's actually a lot. Not as much as we're giving to Ukraine because, of course, their borders a lot more important than ours. Shut up, racist. But it is billions more than Donald Trump asked for to build the border wall. And at the time, senators in both parties said that was just way too expensive and racist and people will just build taller ladders. Okay. But now the same group is fine with 40 billion for border security.

Why is that? Because they know it's fake. They know it's fake. You can build any structure you want. But if the officials manning the gates, like on January 6, just open the doors, it's meaningless. And of course, Thom Tillis knows that to his eternal shame. How out of it is Thom Tillis? Well, watch Thom Tillis, who clearly has no grounding in the physical reality of America 2022, tell you that letting all these people in giving them citizenship is a good idea because really what we're importing is computer scientists and engineers. Watch Thom Tillis.

So that's just a word salad of phrases Thom Tillis doesn't understand, of course. But think about that. In the last two years, thanks to COVID and the manufactured response to it in this country, our public education system has completely collapsed. Kids are not being educated. We're not producing programmers, partly because of policies that Thom Tillis stood by and allowed to be enacted under COVID. But rather than fix that, we need to legalize millions of Dreamers and give them citizenship. 

So if you really want a lot of computer programs -- there are a lot of them around the world -- you would make an active attempt to identify them and import them, and then you could tell us why. But to let in people without high school educations, by the millions, because we need more computer programmers now you're just lying to us, Thom Tillis. How stupid do you think we are? Pretty stupid, apparently.

So what's the border actually look like? Well, Charlie Leduff, our reporter friend from Michigan, formerly The New York Times, has been to the border recently. Spent a lot of time there, caught a lot on video. Here's some footage that tells you who's actually coming over.

So most Americans, because this is a pretty big country, have no idea the scale of this. It has been going on for two years and it will completely change this country forever. And it's continuing and nobody is doing anything about it and no one seems upset about it. Is Thom Tillis upset about this? No, computer programmers. Reading his stupid libertarian talking points from 1996. We're going to have a lot more footage from Charlie Leduff from the border, and it shows you what's actually happening there. A lot of people crossing are nice people with families who just want to work and hang drywall and that's great and everyone supports that. Quite a few of them, though, are drug smugglers. Actually, that's true. This is all being orchestrated by cartels and some of them wind up killing Americans.

So the closer you get to the border and this is true of Republicans, Democrats, Hispanics, whites, Blacks, none of that matters. Any American as close to the  is horrified by what's going on there. So the only way that you could support this is by intentionally ignoring what's happening there, like Thom Tillis is and Lisa Murkowski and , all the rest. Today, our Peter Doocy asked Biden, he's going to be in the area soon, ""Are you going to go see the border while you're down there?"" Watch this.

There are more important things going on, right? What's actually happening is the Biden administration ended the policies that would have stopped this flood of unaccompanied minors at the border. And now they want to make the problem even worse. And they're doing it for a reason. They're telling you what the reason is. You're not allowed to notice, but it doesn't make it any less true. This is real. This is happening. No one's stopping it. Republicans are colluding to allow it to continue.

775	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-this-reality-about-ukraines-zelenskyy	2022-12-07 23:56:00	TUCKER CARLSON: This is the reality about Ukraine's Zelenskyy | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. So you remember when Russia invaded Ukraine in February? And at that time, our leaders told us this wasn't some faraway conflict in Eastern Europe. This was our war. ""No military should ever be allowed to invade a sovereign nation,"" they told us. Iraq and Afghanistan obviously not included in that rule. The invasion of Ukraine could not stand because it was a matter of first principles. But more than that, it was a world historic moral battle that we were obligated to join.

It was very clear.  was pure evil. He was Hitler reborn. The Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, was his mirror image. He was saint-like – self-denying, brave, honest, very handsome. And Zelenskyy was fighting for the very same ideals that our country was founded on. A number of news outlets, including CNN and the L.A. Times, compared him to George Washington. So they told us that with one voice month after month, no disagreement allowed. Not surprisingly, it worked. Americans fell hard for President Zelenskyy.

They all did. Even in rural areas that voted against Joe Biden, you saw Ukrainian flags hanging from mailboxes. To many people, it felt like World War II again. The good war. A battle against tyranny abroad for the sake of freedom and democracy at home. Well, the better part of a year later, it's getting harder and harder to believe any of this. Whatever you think of the war in Ukraine, it is pretty clear that Zelenskyy has no interest in freedom and democracy. In fact, Zelenskyy is far closer to Lenin than to George Washington. He is a dictator. He is a dangerous authoritarian who has used a hundred billion in U.S. tax dollars to erect a one-party police state in Ukraine. And that's not an overstatement.

Over the past two years, Zelenskyy has banned opposition parties. He's shut down critical media by force. He's arrested his political opponents. He has sent soldiers into churches. Zelenskyy's secret police have raided monasteries across Ukraine, even a convent full of nuns, and arrested dozens of priests for no justifiable reason whatsoever and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution, which no longer matters. And in the face of this, the Biden administration has said nothing. Not one word. Instead, they just continue to push to send Zelenskyy more tax dollars. So naturally, Zelenskyy has become much bolder. Why wouldn't he?

Last week, he announced his plan to ban an entire religion, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and to seize its property, all for being insufficiently loyal to his regime. And he said it out loud. Watch this.

A free country does not  just because it's not fully on board with the political program of the people running the country. But Zelenskyy is doing that and his cabinet is now devising ways to punish Christians for practicing their banned ancient religion in Ukraine. Quote, ""Personal economic and restrictive sanctions will be applied to any Christian caught worshiping in unapproved ways."" Now, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is more than a thousand years old. With the full backing of the Joe Biden administration and the US Congress, Zelenskyy has decided to ban it. So here's the response of one bishop to the news.

You're not allowed to send soldiers into churches. You're not allowed to arrest dozens of priests because they refuse to bow before you. You're not allowed to ban whole religions. So most of the US media, most have just ignored this. Some have made excuses for it. ""Oh, he has to do this because there is a war."" But there's no justification for this whatsoever. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is not Russian, it's Ukrainian. It has no connection to the Putin government. It has, in fact, officially denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So once again, there is no justification for destroying and banning this church. And yet Zelenskyy's many celebrity backers in the West have said nothing about it, and they should know better.

In May, George W. Bush, the great defender of Christendom, met with Zelenskyy on a Zoom call and afterward, described him as ""the Winston Churchill of our time."" A man who should be praised for his, quote, ""commitment to liberty."" So where's George W. Bush on this question now that his friend, the George Washington of Ukraine, has banned a form of Christianity in that country? Well, George W. Bush has been silent as well. So have many purportedly Christian members of Congress. They're backing Zelenskyy, no matter how many Christians he arrests, no matter how many churches he seizes.

Every single person you just watched has campaigned. Many of them make a habit of campaigning, , ladies and gentlemen, in Christian churches in the United States. Will a single Christian leader say anything to them about this? You are funding the destruction of Christianity in Ukraine. ""Oh, but it's the cause of freedom."" Really? 

The reality is that Ukrainians cannot listen to media outlets that criticize the Zelenskyy government because they've been banned. They cannot play music from Russian singers. No, this is not in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. This is in the democracy of Ukraine that we support. They can't play music from Russian singers. They can't vote for an opposition party because they've all been shut down. And now their churches are being raided and their priests arrested.

So the fact that our leaders are calling this freedom tells you a lot about what they're planning here. Of course. Why would you defend this? Because you approve of it. For its part, Ukraine's defense ministry has stopped pretending this is about freedom. They're just happy they're getting paid and they're finally crushing any opposition in their own country. And that's why Ukraine's military is now using your tax dollars to produce choreographed dance videos for social media consumption. Sort of like the COVID nurses. Here's one of them.

It's just a grotesque postmodern psyop, and anyone who's fallen for this is brain damaged. This is the same Ukrainian defense ministry that lied about the ""Ghost of Kiev"" and the sailors who cursed out the Russian ship. Now they're just having fun. Because they're beating the real enemies, which of course, as always, are domestic. And Time Magazine is fully on board with this. They just informed their four remaining readers that Zelenskyy is the ""person of the year."" And the media chorus is in full scream. Jon Meacham, the purported historian at MSNBC, believes that Zelenskyy is really a lot like the Pope.

Great leaders. So if they'll defend a man who shut down opposition media, arrested his political opponents, arrested priests, sent the army into monasteries and then banned a religion, if they'll defend all of that and call it liberty, they'll defend anything.

776	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-climate-activists-fraudulent	2022-12-12 22:47:00	TUCKER CARLSON: These climate activists are fraudulent | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out hypocrisy of climate change activists taking private jets on Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of the , if you can even believe it. It seems like a day.  has been there almost the whole time. He was sworn in, in early February of 2021. And when he was, he had high hopes. We looked at the tape today. Though he had no previous experience with transportation, or for that matter, with secretarial work, Buttigieg held up his right hand and swore an oath to Kamala Harris to be the best darn Secretary of Transportation he could be. And he seemed to mean it, but not for long. Sadly, history soon intervened. 

Just weeks into the job, Buttigieg discovered that some of the roads he was supposed to be overseeing, the roads he was now secretary of, were in fact racist and not just ""low grade, got drunk and wrote insensitive Facebook post ten years ago"" racist. Not that kind of racism. No. These were hardcore, David Duke-level, nasty old segregationist roads. These were roads that refused to respond to reason and clearly had no intention of changing. And during the 21st century. Some of these roads literally had white stripes painted on them. White stripes. Jim Crow stuff.

Buttigieg seemed shocked by the whole thing. They don't have roads like that back in South Bend, Indiana. So for Pete Buttigieg, it was a pivot point. It was one of those moments of profound disillusionment so common to high-minded, young newcomers to Washington, where everything changes in an instant. All your preconceptions washed away. Here he'd sworn an oath to take care of the roads, but learned the hard way that some roads are beyond repair. They are too racist to fix. So Pete Buttigieg embarked on another path. He became one of America's foremost religious leaders. 

As an Episcopalian, it was not an easy transition. Traditionally, members of the clergy believe in God. But Buttigieg had a characteristically clever solution, an approach he had learned during his years as a McKinsey consultant. In place of the concept of an omnipotent, loving God who brings justice to the world, Buttigieg simply substituted the word ""climate."" Thanks be to climate. ""Our climate who weren't in heaven"" –  that kind of thing. And it sounded pretty good. Here's one of his sermons:

So this was really a milestone in modern Christian theology. Climate, declared Father Buttigieg, is a moral issue. Not a meteorological matter, not even a policy topic. It's a moral issue. Climate is a question that bears directly on the fate of your immortal soul. When you mistreat the climate, you risk damnation. In so much as you have done to the least of these, you have done it to the climate. Big change. You thought it was about the science? Actually, it's about morality. 

Okay, Reverend Pete. So you set the terms here. So how's your climate record? That seems like a fair question, given that you've just told us that we will go to hell for our carbon emissions. So let's see how you're doing. 

Fox News Digital just got a hold of the Reverend Pete's travel schedule, a list of trips he's taken since getting the job at the Transportation Department. And it turns out that Reverend Pete is the Jimmy Swaggart of climate clergy. He was commanding you not to do it the same time he was doing it himself in a very big way, way more than you ever thought of doing it.

Reverend Pete has sinned. Oh boy, has he in a dark and very naughty way. In less than two years, Buttigieg has flown private, at taxpayer expense, nearly 20 times. He's jetted to Ohio and Florida and New Hampshire, among other places. In September, Buttigieg took an FAA jet to a Canadian gay rights ceremony to accept an award for his LGBTQ+ advocacy. Something else he's been doing since he gave up on the roads.

All this has been extremely expensive for you and every other taxpayer. You may recall that Donald Trump's HHS secretary, Tom Price, lost his job for doing exactly the same thing. An outrage – Politico.com drove him out of office. 

So it's expensive. But that's not the real crime. The real crime here is against the climate. It's a sin. It's a moral transgression because none of these planes that Pete Buttigieg was jetting around on were solar-powered. Not a single one ran on a windmill or recycled French fry oil. They were all fossil fueled. All of them. And there is likely no mode of transportation in the history of machines that emits more carbon than private air travel. That would include long trips across India on coal-fired locomotives.

Private jet travel stands alone. Private jets emit an average of two tons of carbon dioxide in an hour. Per hour. For perspective, that's 14 times more carbon emissions per passenger than the JetBlue flight you're on, or any other commercial flight. So you might as well start a tire fire to heat your house. That would be better for the atmosphere than what . 

Traveling by private jet is literally the last thing that Father Pete should ever do. But we shouldn't be surprised that he's doing it. You may remember that last year, when Pete Buttigieg was busted commuting in a carbon belching SUV, one of the vehicles that destroys the climate, then unloading a bicycle from the back seat for a short, widely photographed ride to the White House. You're seeing that footage on your screen now. Now, that should have been the very first tip that Reverend Pete's sermons and the self-described climate activists who applauded those sermons are all entirely fraudulent.

And in fact, they are fraudulent. Roughly half of all emission created by airplanes are emitted by the richest 1% of the population flying private. The great majority of these, Biden voters and big fans of, you guessed it, the Reverend Pete Buttigieg. This year alone, to pick but one among many examples, Steven Spielberg, who said he's ""terrified"" of climate change, emitted over 4400 metric tons of carbon from private jets. How much is that? That's 600 times more emissions than the average person emits in a year. Another climate activist, Taylor Swift, nearly doubled Steven Spielberg's total. 8000 metric tons of CO2 in a year, all of them destroying the planet, rising the seas on a fence against Mother Earth. Now, Taylor Swift justified it by saying, ""Oh, I loan out jet sometimes. Oh, it's okay."" But it's not okay. Not if you claim to believe in climate change.

A 50-minute flight on a private jet can emit as much carbon as the average person's car does over an entire year. 50 minutes. So imagine what a flight from D.C. to L.A.X. does, or more likely from Hamptons to Aspen. And then imagine thousands and thousands, tens of thousands, of these flights, all carrying people who claim they believe that climate change is, quote, ""existential."" It's not a mistake. It's intentional. It's a statement and it's quite a statement if you think about it.

 If you're yapping about carbon emissions and climate and then flying private, what you're really doing is hoisting a screaming middle finger to the country, to the plebs below in their SUVs, which you say you plan to ban. 

And not just in this country. We've got it easy. The economies of entire nations around the world are being destroyed right now in the name of fighting climate change, at the behest of people who fly private. So people are going hungry and freezing to death around the world so that Pete Buttigieg and his friends won't have to walk through the magnetometer at the TSA checkpoint. I don't mean to single out the Reverend Pete. Though he is certainly the most self-righteous of the group. They're all doing it.

Is there a single high level climate activist who doesn't fly private? At the recent climate summit, more than 400 attendees flew in privately, not on JetBlue, in their own planes. Jeff Bezos is one of them. He flew in his private jet. So did Boris Johnson. John Kerry was famously busted flying to a climate summit in Iceland on his personal Gulfstream. But don't worry, he had no choice. He's too important. Watch.

Oh, someone like me. You never heard of Zoom, pal? You should be in jail by your own standards. You're a climate criminal. You're a climate criminal. You should be in prison by your own standards. Not just him. Virtually every recognizable person in American politics and entertainment flies private. Nancy Pelosi flies private. Barack Obama flies private. Leonardo DiCaprio flies private. You know who flies private a lot? Al Gore flies private. Michael Bloomberg. Boy, does he fly private. In a four-year period, the U.N. climate envoy, Mr. Bloomberg, took more than 1700 private flights, burning more than 10,000 metric tons of CO2. 

You could never do that. If you filled your yard with diesel engines and never turned them off, you would not do that. Your car emits less than five metric tons of CO2 a year. So this is meaningful. This is an actual offense against Mother Earth and the climate.

So you have to wonder what the defenders of climate think of this. What about the climate warriors at Greenpeace and the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund? Have they noticed this? Not really. Have they scolded their donors for undermining their core message? No, of course not. Katherine Clark, the incoming Democratic Party House Whip, doesn't complain either. She should be because her own child  about climate change.

Okay, so you terrorized your own children. You scared the crap out of little kids about climate. So you must be very upset about what Pete Buttigieg is doing to climate by flying private, which is the most destructive thing you can do to climate other than signing off on the sabotage of a Russian natural gas pipeline, which I guess they also did. But who's noticing? But she's not worried about it. Katherine Clark doesn't care and neither do her donors, including the environmental activists who send her all that money. Meanwhile, a lot of young people are very upset about climate. They believe Pete Buttigieg. And you know what they're doing? They're destroying some of the greatest artwork in Western civilization because they want you to know how important the climate is. 

So, groups like that, those thugs, those monsters, the Stalinist mobs, didn't appear out of nowhere. It's not organic, of course. They were whipped into a frenzy by John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi and Pete Buttigieg. Those were their inspiration. But what's interesting is they're  that are most valuable in our society. Our art, the legacy of our civilization. But you know what they haven't done? They haven't said a single word about Al Gore's personal Gulfstream or John Kerry's or Pete Buttigieg. Well, that's weird, isn't it? They're attacking our civilization's art, but they're not saying anything about the people who are actually destroying the climate.

And, you know who else isn't? BlackRock. The ESG score that you keep hearing about? Your flights on private planes have no effect on an ESG score. Really? The ""E"" is for environment, but BlackRock doesn't say a word. Could it be that the climate movement isn't really about the climate or about the environment? Could it be that the climate movement is really about creating a permanent caste system where the people at the top of society, the Brahmins, can do literally whatever they want? Can violate with impunity the standards they impose on others, while endlessly lecturing and oppressing the population that supposedly runs the country, but of course, actually doesn't. Could it be? Oh, it's possible.

We called Pete Buttigieg's office today and asked how you can justify flying private as the Earth warms and the seas rise. How are you not a climate criminal? Speak slowly so we can understand. Of course, they didn't explain. But the rest of us should impose this as a litmus test going forward. No one who seeks to impose carbon rationing on another human being should ever be allowed to step within 100 yards of a private aircraft. Period. Anyone who claims to be serious about fighting climate change should demand tomorrow morning a federal law against private air travel. Make it illegal. It's that simple. Then, go ahead and fly commercial with everyone else or stay home. What's the argument against that? Well, here's what you do know. Anyone who lectures you about climate and opposes banning private air travel is a total fraud and should be ignored.

777	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-americas-real-problems-ignored	2022-12-13 22:32:00	TUCKER CARLSON: America's real problems are being ignored | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to President Biden signing the Respect for Marriage Act on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Time for a confession, right off the bat. There were times, we will admit it, back in the dark ages of cable news, when we'd milk a single news event for weeks. In some cases, and we're talking to you, O.J. Simpson, for months and months and months. There just wasn't that much going on. So you couldn't afford to waste a good story. 

That is not the problem we are having these days. The problem now is the opposite of course. There's too much going on and some of it is terrifying. In just the last week, China signed a $50 billion trade deal with Saudi Arabia, our old ally, signaling an end to America's longstanding global petro empire. That's not a small thing. Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, who runs Russia, once again threatened to launch a nuclear war on the West. Then Wall Street began laying off large numbers of people, which is not something you can ignore in an industry whose business it is to predict the future of the economy. 

And at the same time that was happening, the wealth of the average American household dropped to one of the lowest levels ever recorded. The CDC responded by trying to resurrect face masks because that will help.  got arrested. And then the Mexican drug cartels, which run the largest human trafficking operation since the Transatlantic Slave Trade ended, now officially have control of our southern border.

So it's been a busy week. In fact, more has happened in this past week than happened during two full terms under Bill Clinton. A lot. So if you're running our country right now, you'd be staying up all night, every night, trying to figure out how to respond. 

But that's not what the Biden administration is doing. Not at all. This afternoon, as the old global order collapses to be replaced by God knows what, the Biden people decided to hold a drag event at the White House. Just in case you were wondering if those comparisons to Weimar were overstated, no, they're not overstated.

The occasion for this celebration was the official signing of the Respect for Marriage Act, which the White House tells us will codify gay marriage into law. But wait a moment, you wonder. Wasn't gay marriage legalized by the Supreme Court way back under Barack Obama? Well, yeah. But they've legalized it again. It's double legal. And you know what that means? That means it's time to hear from Lady Gaga.

Dance party at the White House! Hurray! What's been legal for years is still legal. Break out the White Claw. 

Cyndi Lauper was there, of course, to celebrate. Cyndi Lauper is going to be 70 years old this spring, meaning she's lived in this country a long time. But until today, until this afternoon at the White House, under the beneficent gaze of Joe Biden the Great, Cyndi Lauper informed us that Americans were not allowed to love each other. Until today, love was banned. But Joe Biden changed that. And now we're free to love. Watch this and see if you don't choke up just a little.

Wait. Didn't that happen 10 years ago? Well, we checked. That tape is from today. The party was at the White House today. And that means that somewhere, our nuclear disposal friend, Sam Brinton, formerly of the Energy Department, is sitting atop a pile of stolen women's clothes, cursing the fact that airports have security cameras in the baggage claim. Damn those cameras. 

If only Brinton hadn't been caught, this would have been like Christmas for him. He could have spent the morning in Cyndi Lauper's dressing room trying to purloin a new halter top. Talk about a missed opportunity. 

Thankfully, Marti Cummings was there to make up for it. Cummings is a drag star who like Sam Brinton, has a long history of unfiltered social media posts. ""F the police,"" Cummings tweeted in 2020. ""Yes, we want to defund the police. Yes, we want to abolish ICE. No, we won't settle for anything less. We'll continue to fight for this to happen."" That sounds like Antifa. Well, yeah. And to prove it, this year, Cummings promoted something called ACAB Coffee, using the all but copyrighted slogan of Antifa.

So here you have an Antifa-friendly drag queen dressing up like a woman and promoting violence. Talk about a perfect White House guest. And, of course, Cummings is also interested in children in all the wrong ways. 

Cummings once tweeted this: ""The kids are out to sing and suck"" to perform fellatio. Oh, okay. Cummings then added, ""Anyone who thinks drag isn't for children is wrong."" Cummings had posted this picture with a child writing, ""He wants to perform with us next year."" So if you think it's unfair to accuse people of being creepy with kids? Not that unfair, actually. Kind of fair. Here is Cummings at a TED Talk in 2019.

Yeah. A lot of kids want to be a drag queen. So that's the guy at the White House today, but it's not really an anomaly. It was just a month ago the administration invited a guy called Dylan Mulvaney. That's a grown man who identifies as a walking stereotype of a little girl and he met the President.

So what's going on here? Well, multiple things of course. This is an effort to degrade the country, to make it into a joke. These are people striding through the hallways that once were the work area of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and FDR. Whatever you think of their policies, these were serious men who stayed up late every night thinking about how to make the country better. And now there's that guy, and a lot of people like that. And Cyndi Lauper. Celebrating gay marriage, which has been legal since the Obama administration. What is going on here?

Well, again, it's an effort to degrade the country. But as a political matter, it's a distraction. Offend you so much or mesmerize you so completely that you forget that there are multiple world historic crises unfolding at the same time, some of which the Biden administration caused, none of which it can solve. 

That's the point. They have no idea what to do about the collapse of the postwar order, which is on display. Or the continuing slow motion collapse of the American economy, which you feel because you're poorer than you were last year, and they don't have anything to say to you. Even if they cared, they wouldn't have an answer. Here's a drag show. Welcome to Weimar. What happens next? 

But the point is, you lose any perspective about everything else real that is happening. This is a tactic, and it's not a new tactic. Actually, Joe Biden once recognized this tactic because if nothing else, he knows politics. Here's Biden in 2006 in a clip we were grateful to get, recognizing that complaining about gay marriage, whatever you think of gay marriage, is a pretty handy way for politicians to distract from their own failures. Here's Joe Biden.

So he gets a pass because that was pre-dementia. He has no memory of saying any of that. Now he's just a vessel for the ambitions of others. 

But that was an interesting insight. People talk about stuff like this, particularly when it's not, strictly speaking, ""relevant"" because they don't want to talk about other things. And that makes it even more interesting that Joe Biden's handlers, 16 years later, are telling him to talk about gay marriage and drag shows. Anything to distract you. And in fact, at today's bill signing, just to completely pull your attention away from everything else that's going on, Joe Biden came out in favor of gay marriage -- of course, because it's been legal for 10 years -- and in favor of the genital mutilation of children. Here he is.

It's pretty interesting when you think about it. So this is a bill signing, affirming the legality – legalizing once again, gay marriage, which most people support in this country. Should people be able to get married if they love each other? Yeah, they should. That's fine. Not that controversial a point at this stage. 

But here's Joe Biden using that opportunity to  for kids. And of course, that means the sexual mutilation of children, cutting the breasts off 15-year olds, sterilizing them for life with chemicals. That's what Boston Children's Hospital and many other hospitals have been doing. Puberty blockers. Have fun with osteoporosis when you're 30. 

So why would Joe Biden be promoting that apart from the fact certain special interest groups want him to? Again, this was supposed to be about gay marriage. But here you have Joe Biden, President of the United States, purportedly pushing child sexual mutilation. And then you have -- this is even weirder -- Kamala Harris out there talking about contraception. Really? Watch.

Now we're just confused. The right to buy contraception now. No one on this show is a legal scholar. But Griswold v. Connecticut came down in 1967, which affirmed, from the high court, the right of Americans to buy contraception. That was 56 years ago. 

Interracial marriage? Hmm, that's been legal for our lifetimes. No one's trying to make it illegal. Not one person is pushing to make that illegal. Not one. So here you have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris affirming your right to buy the pill and marry someone of a different race, even though neither right is under attack by anyone. Why are they doing this? 

Well, it's of apiece with their agenda recently. Remember, this is the same party that pushed through an anti-lynching bill this year. Lynching! Was that on the list of major problems? Are there lynchings going on? Wasn't that already illegal? ""No, we just banned it for the first time."" Watch.

After all these years? There are a lot of people who are for lynching, but we held off the pro-lynching lobby, and we got this through the Congress. We've improved your life. Really? Where are all these lynchings? Where all these racial acts of terror committed by White supremacists? Search the Internet for them. You will see some racial acts of terror. Hard to find a lot committed by White supremacists. Any maybe. Where are the numbers on that? How many racial attacks by White supremacists have there been in the last couple of years? Maybe there've been a lot. We're not familiar with that. We're not aware that that actually happened. Pretty sure it didn't actually happen. 

We do know that nooses have appeared in various places. Do you remember that? There was one at the construction site of Barack Obama's new presidential library? Maybe that's what they're talking about. They offered a six-figure award to catch the person who tied rope in a forbidden shape, but no culprit was ever found. How weird. Then there was that noose in the NASCAR garage. Then there was a noose around Jesse Smollett's neck. Is that the lynching they're banning?

The funny thing is, you know that's not real. And most people know it's not real. Why are they continuing to say this? Well, because as actual problems, real problems mount, and they have no answer and no solution, and they're trying to dodge culpability for creating those problems in the first place, they have to doubledown on fake problems. We're banning lynching. And no one laughed? There's not one person who's for lynching. 

Bill Melugin and his team, speaking of real problems, just shot this new video of massive crowds of foreign nationals invading our country. Sorry, that's just true. Most of them are not from Mexico. They're from very, very far away across the oceans. And now they're in a Mexican border town across from Brownsville, Texas. And they're waiting there for  in eight days. 

And when that happens, when the Biden administration drops that last piece of legal defense against invasion, it's going to be an overwhelming wave, of course. Maybe that's why they're bringing drag stars and Cyndi Lauper to the White House. Because they don't want to talk about, I don't know, the threat of nuclear war from Vladimir Putin? 

So we're now at war -- a hot war, not a proxy war -- a hot war with Russia. American military personnel, lots of U.S. government employees are in Ukraine fighting that war with American weapons that you paid for. And the guy we're at war with just threatened to use nuclear weapons against us. 

Now, whatever you think of that war, that's not a story? That's not bigger than banning lynching or legalizing gay marriage again, when it was already legal or legalizing contraception, which has been legal since 1967 or interracial marriage. 

What? Talk about a head fake. Who's falling for this? Oh, everyone.

778	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-can-we-learn-happening-california	2022-12-14 22:38:00	TUCKER CARLSON: What can we learn from what's happening in California? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls out cities for punishing people based on skin color on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

In the summer of 2020, mobs of Joe Biden voters destroyed big parts of the . They looted stores. They burned a police station. They murdered people. But they did this, we were informed at the time, in the name of something called racial justice. But then we saw that some of the mob turned out to be privileged White kids, the children of lawyers from Bethesda. But, they said they were rioting on behalf of so-called marginalized communities.

They were working for racial justice. And because of that, they couldn't be punished for what they did. Nor, by the way, were they required to wear COVID masks like the rest of us. That's how holy their mission was. They're exempt from the normal laws of civilization. Kamala Harris raised money for them like they were missionaries. You probably remember that.

But do you recall what happened next in Minneapolis? That's the part of the story the media had no interest in covering. And they never do. The iron law of liberal social activism is that you never revisit the scenes of your moral victories. You give a speech declaring yourself a good person and you go home. You don't return to Selma or Soweto or Ferguson, Missouri, to see how the people there are doing because it's not about those people. It's about you and your newly enhanced moral authority, which is instantly convertible to political power and cash. Ask Barack Obama.

But in the spring of 2021, one reporter decided to break with protocol and go back to Minneapolis a year later. He wanted to see what racial justice had done for the city. His name was Michael Tracey, and as you can imagine, he writes for Substack, not The New York Times. 

One night, while Tracey was in Minneapolis, a man walked into a Somali-owned convenience store and murdered the clerk. Tracey wanted to know why that happened. So, he started to interview people in the neighborhood and one of them told him this: ""African Americans are hunting Somalis in Minneapolis."" Why is that? Well, because: ""They believe Somalis are getting special favors from the government."" Are you surprised to hear that? You should not be surprised because when government creates a spoils system based on race and ethnicity — and our government certainly has done that — division and violence are the inevitable outcomes. That is true always and everywhere. That fact never changes.

And liberals for many decades used to pretend to understand that. That's why they opposed Jim Crow and the Nuremberg Laws. But at some point, and it would be interesting to know precisely when and why, liberals enthusiastically embraced the racial spoils system they once claimed to hate. This is unfolding across the country, but it's especially prevalent in places liberals control. The more power liberals have, the more sweeping and rigid the race-based spoils system they create. In California, of course, they have absolute power, and that's why the government of San Francisco has just announced they will send you money if you have the right skin color.

The most vulnerable people in the community. If you're the most vulnerable person in the community, you get $1,000 a month. But that specifically does not include the homeless guy OD'ing in the park on fentanyl if he's White. If he's White, he can die because if he's White, even if he's dying, he's by definition not vulnerable. California now has many programs like this. The state has now proposed a  for the descendants of slaves. It seems simple, but there's a problem with it. How do you know who qualifies for reparations? It's been a long time. It's been more than 150 years since slavery. And Americans have made a lot of babies since then, and many of them are interracial.

So at this point, there are plenty of White people in America who are descended from slaves. There are plenty of Black people in America who are descended from slave owners. That's just true. So how do you know who qualifies for government reparations? Well, of course, there's only one way to find out. And it's old-fashioned Nazi race science. Nazi race science. So the state will have to certify the racial purity of its citizens in order to send them money. That's going to have to happen. Do we really want to go there? Do we really want to do that? Amazingly, liberals really do.

The city of San Francisco just fired its elections director, a man called John Arntz, because he's White. We're not guessing at that. The president of San Francisco's election commission, Chris Jerdonek, confirmed that was the reasoning. And we're quoting: ""Our decision,"" he said to the man who was fired, ""was not about your performance. But after 20 years, we wanted to take action on the city's racial equity plan and give people an opportunity to compete for a leadership position."" Fired for his skin color. 

Aren't we against that? Didn't we have a civil rights movement to stop that? And by the way, in this specific case, the guy who got fired, John Arntz, single-handedly ended widespread corruption and incompetence in San Francisco's election. He had the job for two decades. They used to have ballot boxes turning up regularly in the San Francisco Bay. That was fraud. He stopped it. But his skin color was the problem. The shade of his skin was more offensive to liberals in San Francisco than fraudulent elections.

Now, there was an outcry over this and Arntz ultimately got his job back. But the city of San Francisco — the government, not just the people, the government — still endorses the idea of punishing people based on their skin color. The city of San Francisco just launched a separate guaranteed income program, this one for ""pregnant Black women."" It pays up to $1,000 a month. And that program got more than $5 million more in state funding, so it's expanding. Now to Los Angeles, Riverside, Contra Costa County, Alameda. The left-wing group Expecting Justice just put together this promo for the program. 

o that is, every word of it, a racist lie. There's precisely no evidence that structural racism exists in this country against the communities she's talking about, and none whatsoever that it causes higher infant mortality. There's no science whatsoever. That's just, again, a racist lie. But more to the point, nobody who says birthing people should ever be in charge of handing out money to mothers, much less taxpayers' money. But of course, that's happening. And that tells you, well, this is a grift. This is a scam designed to shunt money from people who make it to people who vote for the right party. And that's why Sheila Jackson Lee recently demanded billions of dollars of reparations. Because that, she said, would have been a much better way to deal with COVID.

So, she's obviously a fringe character and easy to make fun of. But it wasn't just Sheila Jackson Lee. That was the official position. That was the prevailing view of the Democratic Party in 2020. Vote for us and we'll give reparations based on skin color.

So again, it's hard to overstate just how crazy and divisive that is. In order for that to work in practice, you would have to take people's blood and figure out what percentage they were of one race or the other. Maybe measure their heads. You would wind up with Nazi race science, with racial purity tests. And no decent person wants to live in a country where the government does that. It's obviously a dead end and a terrible idea. And it would, of course, promote violence and division. So that's a non-starter when you think about it.

But Joe Biden decided he was going to get around a national debate on reparations simply by just doing it, throwing it in the farm bill. Biden, right after he took office, allocated billions of dollars in farm aid based on race — just on race. A judge, thankfully, shut that down. But they didn't slow down in their effort to create a racial spoils system. They don't care about what it does to the country. 

So  suggested that certain communities, based on their skin color, deserved faster hurricane response. So there's an entire civil rights department at the Justice Department, a division, designed to stop the government from rewarding or punishing people on the basis of skin color. That was the whole point of the civil rights movement. But they're doing nothing. Of course. They're encouraging it because Democrats run the government.

So as a result, California has launched yet another basic income program, this time for trans people. Really? How is that going to work? How do you prove you're trans? Can anyone even define what that means? No. But here's San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman bragging about how much taxpayer money London Breed gives to people for being trans.

The most vulnerable people. Really? How are we measuring vulnerability when ""The View"" supports and celebrates your existence every single day? When every fashionable person in America posts tributes to you on social media every week, how vulnerable are you? Let's get right to it. Let's measure that by household income. Is the household income of the average trans person in America higher or lower than it is on an Indian reservation? Hmm. Is it higher or lower than it is in rural Iowa?

And by the way, what is transgender? On the current application in San Francisco, there are 97 different gender options available, 19 sexual orientations. These would include aromantic, demisexual, d***, pansexual, same-gender loving and skoliosexual. So at this point, probably not going to get California back into the realm of functional and sane. Twenty years from now, that will be a deeply poor state presided over by a small group of incredibly rich people. Every normal person of all colors will have left and moved to Florida. Probably no fixing it at this point. They'll be cutting the redwood forests, selling them for money. You know exactly where this is going. Look at Bolivia. But what can the rest of us, in the other 49 states, learn from what's happening in California?

779	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-heres-source-cia-jfks-assassination	2022-12-15 22:41:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Here's what a source said about the CIA and JFK's assassination | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on a source saying the CIA was involved in JFK's assassination on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Not long after Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald on camera in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, a lot of Americans started to have some questions about the . It was, you'd have to admit, a pretty extraordinary sequence of events. A lone gunman murders the president of the United States. And then, less than 48 hours later, that lone gunman is himself murdered by another lone gunman.

What are the odds of that? It's one thing if you get struck by lightning – rare but possible. But if every member of your family also gets struck by lightning, all on different days, you might begin to suspect these are not entirely natural events. But oh, replied the U.S. government, they are. This bizarre chain of killings was all entirely natural."" 

So less than a year after the JFK assassination, the Johnson White House released something called the Warren Commission Report. And the report concluded that while their motives remained unclear, both Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby had acted alone. No one helped them. There was no conspiracy of any kind. Case closed. Time to move on.

And many Americans did move on. At the time, they had no idea how shoddy and corrupt the Warren Commission was. It would be nearly 50 years before the CIA admitted under duress that in fact, it had withheld information from investigators about its relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald. 

But even then, at the time, before that was known, the government's explanation didn't seem entirely plausible. And some people started asking obvious questions about it. It was at that point, as Americans started to doubt the official story, that the term ""conspiracy theory"" entered our lexicon. As Professor Lance DeHaven-Smith points out in his book on the subject, ""The term conspiracy theory did not exist as a phrase in everyday American conversation before 1964. In 1964, the year the Warren Commission issued its report, the New York Times published five stories in which 'conspiracy theory' appeared.""

Now, today, of course, the term ""conspiracy theory"" appears in pretty much every New York Times story about American politics. It's wielded, now as then, as a weapon against anyone who asks questions the government doesn't feel like answering. But despite 60 years of name-calling, those questions have not disappeared. In fact, they have multiplied with time.

And here's one of them. In April of 1964, a psychiatrist called Louis Joylon West visited Jack Ruby in his isolation cell in a Dallas jail. According to West's written assessment, he found that Jack Ruby was ""technically insane"" and in need of immediate psychiatric hospitalization. Those are conclusions that puzzlingly no one who had spoken to Jack Ruby previously had reached. Ruby had seemed perfectly sane to the people who knew him. Louis Jolyon West pronounced him crazy. 

But what West did not say was that he was working for the CIA at the time. Louis Jolyon West was a contract psychiatrist for the spy agency. He was also an expert on mind control and a prominent player in the now infamous MKUltra program in which the CIA gave powerful psychiatric drugs to Americans without their knowledge.

So of all the psychiatrists in the world, what in the world was this guy doing in Jack Ruby's prison cell? The media did not seem interested in finding out. In fact, the New York Times, in an extensive 1999 obituary of West, never mentioned the fact that he had worked for the CIA, much less his time in Jack Ruby's cell, which seems relevant. So you can see why non-crazy people would wonder about what really happened. And of course, many have wondered. 

In 1976, long forgotten, the House of Representatives impaneled a special committee to reinvestigate the JFK assassination. Their bipartisan conclusion? Jack Kennedy was almost certainly murdered as the result of a conspiracy. But the question is a conspiracy by whom? Well, the obvious suspect would be the CIA. Why else would the agency withhold critical evidence from investigators? Is there a benign explanation for that, for maintaining this level of secrecy for this many years? Not that we're aware of. And it is illegal. 

In 1992, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. That act mandated full disclosure of all documents by 2017, 54 years after JFK was killed. The last administration promised to comply fully with that law. But under intense pressure from CIA Director Mike Pompeo, withheld, in the end, thousands of pages of CIA documents.

Today, this afternoon, the  did exactly the same thing. That would be thousands of pages of documents after nearly 60 years, after the death of every single person involved. But we still can't see them. Clearly, it's not to protect any person. They're all dead. It's to protect an institution. But why?

Well, today we decided to find out. We spoke to someone who had access to these still hidden CIA documents, a person who was deeply familiar with what they contained. We asked this person directly, ""Did the CIA have a hand in the murder of John F. Kennedy, an American President? And here's the reply we received verbatim. Quote, ""The answer is yes. I believe they were involved. It's a whole different country from what we thought it was. It's all fake.""

It's hard to imagine a more jarring response than that. Again, this is not a ""conspiracy theorist"" that we spoke to. Not even close. This is someone with direct knowledge of the information that once again is being withheld from the American public. And the answer we received was unequivocal. Yes, the CIA was involved in the assassination of the president. Now, some people will not be surprised to hear that they suspected it all along. But no matter how you feel about it or what you thought about the Kennedy assassination, pause to consider what this means.

It means that within the US government, there are forces wholly beyond democratic control. These forces are more powerful than the elected officials that supposedly oversee them. These forces can affect election outcomes. They can even hide their complicity in the murder of an American president. In other words, they can do pretty much anything they want. They constitute a government within a government mocking, by their very existence, the idea of democracy. As cynical as we have become after 30 years of watching government officials ignore the voters who employ them, we were shocked to learn this. It's not acceptable.

Americans have trusted their government less with every passing year since the killing of John F. Kennedy. Maybe this is why. And people have known this for a long time. The people who knew would include every director of the CIA since November of 1963. And that list would include Obama's CIA director, , one of the most sinister and dishonest figures in American life. 

That list would also include, we are sad to say, our friend Mike Pompeo, who ran the CIA in the last administration. Mike Pompeo knew this. We asked Pompeo to join us tonight, and though he rarely turns down a televised interview, he refused to come. We hope he will reconsider.

We'd like to take a moment to say goodbye to one of our all-time favorite members of Congress, Mr.  of Kankakee, Illinois, ladies and gentlemen. Kinzinger was first elected to the House 12 years ago, and for the bulk of his time in office, he served utterly without distinction, in virtual anonymity. A few of his constituents had heard of him, but none expressed interest in learning more. Then in 2018 came the transformation. That was the year that Adam Kinzinger turned 40 and things began to change inside of him.  

The first signs were subtle but unmistakable: choking up at a car insurance commercial, opening an Instagram account and posting pictures of himself, wearing spandex bike shorts to Starbucks without shame and sometimes, with a fanny pack. By 2021, Kinzinger had a full-blown case of male menopause with all the familiar, painful symptoms: mood swings, hot flashes, food cravings, uncontrollable weeping.  

A lesser man would have retreated from public life, chosen new pronouns and transitioned in private, but Adam Kinzinger chose another path. He chose to be a role model. He wanted other middle-aged men to know there is life after hormonal imbalance, and so on July 27, 2021, Adam Kinzinger bravely came out of the closet as a weepy man. You may remember the moment. 

Imagine the courage that took. ""Yes, I am emotionally incontinent. Yes, I am utterly irrational. No, I will not be silent."" In Washington, Kinzinger's performance was considered deeply inspirational. Here's a man who has no control of himself at all, so we'd better put him in charge of important things. Kinzinger quickly became regarded as an essential voice on foreign policy. When the world hangs in the balance, you want a guy who cries a lot. 

For his part, Kinzinger demonstrated a remarkable ability to make any situation on the planet, no matter how complex or weighty, all about him: diplomacy by narcissism. Here he was yesterday on the House floor in his final, yes, emotion-laden address.  

Yeah, it's just the right thing to do. See, the world actually isn't complicated. In fact, the world is simple. It's like an original, made-for-TV movie on Lifetime, the kind where you burn through two bags of Skinny Pop just trying to keep your tears in check. If  is doing something in a foreign country with guns, by definition, it's ""just the right thing to do,"" like in Syria. Kinzinger's often expressed concern for Syria's men, women and children is what matters and because that concern matters so much, Kinzinger has pushed hard to continue the neocon proxy war in Syria.  

Results? Syria now has no economy left and there's a massive cholera outbreak in progress. Men, women and children are dying in huge numbers because it's just the right thing to do. Same in Ukraine. 

Kinzinger made that clear the other day when he responded personally to a Twitter account called ""Catturd"" because when you're one of Washington's leading authorities on foreign policy, you spend a lot of time on Twitter reading accounts with names like ""Catturd.""  

So, the other day, ""Catturd"" made the mistake of posting a meme that seemed to mock the colors of the Ukrainian flag, colors that are sacred to Adam Kinzinger and every other empathetic soccer mom in her mid-40s. You can imagine how offensive that was. It was like telling an off-color joke about Meghan Markle. It could not stand — and so alone and battling debilitating hot flashes in this kitchen, fighting the urge to open yet another bag of Chips Ahoy!, Adam Kinzinger fought back. ""Literal evil,"" he wrote in a late-night response to ""Catturd."" ""If I met you in person, it would not end well... for you. Sicko."" 

Woah, hear, that, ""Catturd""? It will not end well for you. It's not a pillow fight Adam Kinzinger is talking about. That's a full-on slap fight with hair-pulling. This is real. You'd better apologize. Our heart goes out to ""Catturd"" tonight, who is probably cowering in a litter box somewhere, waiting for Adam Kinzinger to show up with sharpened nails. Mock the Ukrainian flag, get scratched. Those are the rules, ""Catturd."" It's a tough town. Meow!

Speaking of how it will all end, how's it going to end for Adam Kinzinger? Well, we suspect it will end like it began, in anonymity. In just weeks, Adam Kinzinger will be another CNN contributor. No one will ever see him again, but we will never forget him.  will live forever in our hearts as an example of what a man can be when he stops trying to be a man and unleashes the emotionally fragile, divorced, single mom within. ""Have another glass of chardonnay. Listen to me cry."" Yes, Ms. Kinzinger, we will. So, here it is one last time:  

Au revoir, Adam Kinzinger. See you at SoulCycle.

The contrast between El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico has always been one of the great advertisements for America and for the American way. The cities have a lot in common. They're literally right next to each other. They're separated by one of the narrowest stretches of the Rio Grande River by feet. From downtown El Paso, you can see downtown Juarez, and the populations are not that different.  

Most people in  have relatives in Mexico. The difference is one city is American and one is not. El Paso has always been tranquil and orderly, a really nice town with good schools and friendly people. You would move there. Juarez is terrifying, chaotic, impoverished and dangerous. In 2010, Juarez recorded more than 3,000 murders. In El Paso, just yards away, there were five.  

On one side of the river, you had a high functioning civilization, ours, and on the other side you had the third world and the success of El Paso said everything about the superiority of the American system and American culture. But two years ago, Joe Biden set out to change that. It was an offense against equity. They were too different, but instead of fixing Juarez, he decided to destroy El Paso and make it much more like Juarez. To do that, the administration opened America's southern border to the world. No place in our country was hit harder by that decision than El Paso, Texas.  

In the last year, illegal immigration into El Paso has risen by over 280% – undreds of thousands of foreign nationals streaming in, jobless, penniless, anonymous. What happened next? You know what happened next: the most predictable disaster in the world. Crime skyrocketed. Social cohesion collapsed. Test scores in local schools plummeted, and the city began to fall apart. People who grew up in El Paso started to leave in large numbers. This is what it looks like now: 

Imagine if that was your city – your city – where you work and raised your family, the city that you built and then one day some guy gets elected and decides to destroy it and the media ignores it. No one even covers it. Most Americans have no idea your city has been destroyed.

And it's not just downtown and the shelters. It's the airport, the window into El Paso. In case you haven't flown there recently, here's what it looks like. People seem to be camping on the floor of the place. Looks like the train station in post partition Calcutta, but at least they had a war to blame it on. There's no war in Texas except the war the White House declared on its own country. This footage comes from Katie Daviscourt of Rebel News and we'll talk to her in a moment. 

Where are you from? 

 Peru 

That's the airport. They're not waiting for flights. They're living there. And they're not from Mexico or even El Salvador and Guatemala. They're from, as you just heard, Colombia, Peru, the Dominican Republic, an island. These are countries thousands of miles away, to which we owe nothing. There is no reason for this. There are 7 million American men of working age who are not working. They're on the internet all day. They have nothing to do. And yet we're doing this. The mayor of El Paso, Oscar Leeser, has just declared a state of emergency and you can see why.  

El Paso wasn't like this just a few years ago. Ask anyone who went there. The question is, why isn't the state of Texas stopping this? Where's the Texas National Guard? A few months ago, Greg Abbott, the governor, was running for office. He was running against Beto O'Rourke, and he was willing to say anything to get re-elected. He was willing to lie and apparently he did. He said he'd deploy 10,000 troops to the border. Oh, but he hasn't. He just revised it to 5,000 troops. And then he came up with another solution: just bus thousands of migrants to other states, which is kind of funny. It makes for an amusing cable news segment. But it's still our country, isn't it? And none of these people are ever leaving.  

This is an invasion of our country. We don't have a border and Greg Abbott could stop it, and he isn't. Why isn't the Texas National Guard stopping this? We can't answer that question. We'd love to have Greg Abbott come on and tell us.

But because Texas isn't securing the border, the rest of the country is also overrun with people from foreign countries who have no right to be here and whose identity we don't know. At exactly the moment, we do not need a larger population as our economy moves south. This is what Denver, Colorado, a long way from the border looks like now.  

That's in Denver. Again, a long way from our southern border. This is the biggest story in recent American history, a total change in the American population, millions and millions and millions of new people. The country will never be what it was five years ago. Even if you're for this, you would acknowledge this is a big deal and it's completely ignored by the media, except when they are forced to respond, and they tell you to shut up and stop complaining. 

On ABC News, someone called Martha Raddatz argued that actually it's people who are against immigration who are to blame for the immigration crisis because they're talking about it and therefore advertising it to the rest of the world. Watch this.  

You do fervently wish say, 25,000 Haitians would move to Martha Raddatz’s neighborhood tonight. Maybe she'd give different coverage. But until that happens, and since they've been deported from Martha's Vineyard in all the places people like Martha Raddatz live, the Democratic Party is well able to continue lying. 

Here's Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio explaining that really only racists and crazed conspiracy nuts care about the border. 

It's amazing. That's Sherrod Brown, supposed populist from Ohio, a guy who cares about the little guy and displaced factory workers and those 7 million working age American men who aren't working and are playing video games and watching porn all day. That's your country. Sherrod Brown was elected because he claimed to care about them. And in fact, it wasn't that long ago that Sherrod Brown was down at the border declaring a humanitarian crisis. People were living in cages, people from other countries.  

Now, that same Sherrod Brown says you're not allowed to talk about anything that's happening at the , people camping on streets or at the airport. You also, by the way, can't talk about conditions inside migrant detention centers anymore because they've got a Democratic president Now.  

Texas Representative Tony Gonzalez just went to one. He shot the footage you're seeing on your screen now. That's a detention center in El Paso. It was intended to hold about 1,000 people there, now more than 4,000 inside of it. They're about to be let out onto the street of El Paso. 

Does Sherrod Brown care? What does Martha Raddatz think of this? Again, let's hope every one of these people winds up in their neighborhood.

782	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-why-are-they-lying-us-about-this	2022-12-20 21:53:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Why are they lying to us about this? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson has doubts about the state of the economy under President Biden on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. This past summer, with just a few months to go before the midterm elections, the Biden administration faced a huge problem called the economy. Most voters vote on the basis of the economy and how they feel they're doing and how they feel their country is doing. And their country at the time was not doing well.

The US economy had just recorded two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. That's not just an academic observation. That's a technical . Two quarters. Declining GDP. Recession. We're not making that up. You'll find it in every economics textbook ever written. Go look up the one you used in college. But the Biden administration could not admit that. If they admitted that the US was in a recession, they would lose the Senate. They would lose control of both chambers of the Congress. So they had to lie about it.

But how do you lie about something that's so easily defined, that everyone can see? Well, you just change the definition. And that's what they did. They came up with a new definition of recession. So don't look at GDP. That's the old way, the racist way of assessing the economy. Look at holistic factors. Let's look at the labor market, for example. The labor market. 

Well, then, in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave them ammunition for their case. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report that showed the labor market was strong. They determined that the US economy had added more than a million jobs in the second quarter of this year, from March to June. A million jobs. That's a big deal. It's a big story. And of course, Joe Biden wasted no time in touting it. Watch.

A million new jobs in the second quarter despite negative growth. Wait a second. How do you get a million new jobs with negative growth? That seems like magic. How is that possible? But no one in the media asked questions. Instead, they repeated the White House line, which was the BLS report -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics report -- showing a million new jobs proves we can't be in a recession. They all said it, quote, ""The jobs report suggests the Biden economy is not in a recession,"" wrote The New York Times. And then, of course, there were other stories like that, too. So on the basis of that and other factors, they won. They now have control of the Senate.

And now we get to learn the truth. A million new jobs, really? The Philadelphia Fed decided to check those numbers and they found the US economy did not add more than a million jobs in the second quarter of this year. Instead, the net additional jobs was about 10,000. So that's less than 1% of the job growth the administration claimed. That's not a rounding error. That's not a minor math mistake. This is a country that supposedly sent a man to the moon. We can do math, right? This isn't like thinking you had 100 bucks in your pocket and finding out you had 85. This is like claiming you had $1,000,000 in your pocket and finding out you had $10,000. This is like claiming you were rich when you were actually bankrupt. This is a lie.

So how'd they get it wrong by more than a million jobs? How did they construct this lie? Well, as of tonight, we're not really sure. We now know the BLS numbers didn't just help Joe Biden, though. There was another purpose. These fake numbers also gave the chairman of the Federal Reserve, , a justification to continue raising interest rates. On the basis of that report, they can raise rates. Here was Powell just a few days ago.

Ooh. Every word of that a lie. The justification is a lie. And in fact, as Powell well knows, there are 7 million American men of working age who are not working. They're watching the Internet all day. So why are they lying to us about this? Well, the effects are very obvious. Go try and take out a car loan or a home loan or any kind of loan. Or if you have a loan, it's got an adjustable rate, watch how much more you're paying per month. So why are they doing this? Well, the administration wants Powell to raise rates because they think it'll offset the  that Joe Biden's policies have caused.

But this is a huge problem for everyone else. Raising rates when the economy is faltering and people don't have jobs. If you keep doing that, you could cause an actual collapse. That seems like the course they put us on. The Biden administration got the interest rate hike it wanted even when the labor market has been flatlining. William Beach runs the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Marty Walsh runs the Department of Labor. They need to explain why anyone should ever trust the most basic economic numbers the government issues ever again. And it's one thing to get the numbers wrong, but then to base future policies on numbers you know are wrong, what is that? That's what they're doing. Jerome Powell should probably answer that question fairly soon. He won't join us tonight either.

783	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-zelenskyys-visit-represented-bipartisan-masochism	2022-12-21 22:03:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Zelenskyy's visit represented 'bipartisan masochism' | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson reacts to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's address to Congress on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.

As far as we know, no one's ever addressed the United States Congress in a sweatshirt before, but they love him much more than they love you. Welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Remember when Sam Bankman-Fried showed up in Washington wearing a t-shirt and spouting nonsense, and all the self-described geniuses declared him a hero? The media, the Congress, the White House, they all love this weird little guy called Sam Bankman-Fried. Do you remember that?

Somehow we were reminded of it today when the president of Ukraine arrived , dressed like the manager of a strip club and started to demand money. Amazingly, no one threw him out. Instead, they did whatever he wanted. American taxpayers declare Joe Biden will continue to give Zelenskyy whatever he demands for, quote, ""as long as it takes."" Tellingly, Biden never specified what ""it"" is. As long as it takes to do what? Push the Russian army back to pre-invasion borders? Sounds reasonable.

That's what most Americans likely assume, those who are still paying attention. But that is not what Zelenskyy means, and it is not what he is asking for. Zelenskyy is demanding regime change in Russia, just like in Iraq and Libya, and a long list of other failed states. Except this time, in the heart of the Eurasian landmass, next door to the entire civilized world. That's what Zelenskyy has called for repeatedly, and every dollar we send to him goes toward that end. At this point, he's getting a lot closer to achieving it.

So what happens if he ""wins?"" What does the ensuing chaos look like? Thought about that? Who's going to secure the world's largest nuclear arsenal once we help Zelenskyy topple the Russian government? Who replaces Putin? Strangely, those topics did not come up today because that wasn't the point. The point of today's visit to Washington was not to make the world more stable or make wise decisions, much less to help America. That's always at the bottom of the list. The point was to fawn over the Ukrainian strip club manager and hand him billions more dollars from our own crumbling economy. It is hard, in fact, it may be impossible to imagine a more humiliating scenario for the greatest country on earth. And we would love to blame Joe Biden for it. But we can't really, not entirely, at least.

This was bipartisan masochism. The uniparty is alive and well despite the best efforts of voters, including last month. And if you doubt that it's alive and well, here's a picture of Zelenskyy that he had taken with a group of elderly Republican senators in Kiev back in May. They stand grinning next to him in their orthopedic shoes. 70-year old Susan Collins, John Barrasso, John Cornyn, led by their 80-year old ringleader, Mitch McConnell. 44-year old Zelenskyy poses between them in a skintight polo shirt, flexing like a weightlifter and trying to look ferocious. 

They seem awestruck. Not since a young Fidel Castro showed up in New York wearing battle fatigues has this country's aging leadership class tittered more loudly in delight. They love a man in uniform. What a hunk. So strong and decisive. Look at the expression in Mitch McConnell's face, you could almost hear the giggles of pleasure.

No rational person assessing the issues ever would have predicted this moment. If you were a Republican officeholder and , maybe you would for a moment, ask him about his current and ongoing war against Christianity in Ukraine. Especially if you were, say, Mitch McConnell or John Cornyn and a lot of your own voters go to church on Sunday. They might care about that issue. But McConnell and Cornyn didn't mention it. They didn't say a word. You will not hear a word on television tonight about the fact that Zelenskyy has banned an entire ancient Christian denomination in Ukraine and then seized churches and then thrown priests into jail. According to Mitch McConnell, who apparently hasn't left his office since the mid-eighties, anti-Christian despotism is what most Republicans want above all. They don't get enough. They're just begging for it. Watch McConnell explain.

And two other senators stand behind him, nodding like it's true. Defeating Putin is, quote, ""the number one priority among Republicans,"" says Mitch McConnell, who leads Republicans in the Senate. Number one? Before our own economy? Or our own children's schools? Or, for that matter, before the more than 2000 young people killed last year by fentanyl in Mitch McConnell's ""home state"" of Kentucky? Punishing Vladimir Putin for putting Donald Trump in office is more important than all of that says Mitch McConnell. Ukraine's borders matter. Ours don't matter. You may have suspected they thought that. But at this point, they're just coming out and saying this right in your face. And of course, the White House agrees completely. Watch Joe Biden announce today that you'll be paying for evermore advanced weapons systems to be sent to Ukraine, whether you like it or not.

He's reading his little script. Maybe it was written by the defense contractors that just hosted an event in Washington for the Ukrainian ambassador. Literally, they put their logos on the invitation just in case there was any question about what's going on here. So this is a big change from what we had last month. But you wouldn't know that from the media coverage of it. Your average reporter in Washington likes Zelenskyy a lot more than he likes you. So nobody asks about it. But this is a major policy change. It was just a few months ago that a senior U.S. defense official said, and we're quoting, ""There is no discussion about putting a  in Ukraine. In order to do that, you would have to put U.S. troops with it to operate.""

In other words, you would have to fight a hot war against Russia, which has not only not been approved by the Congress, but most Americans have no idea that's happening. But now it is happening. Did you know that? Are you for that? Is it the most important thing? More important than your nephew dying of fentanyl? Yes, says Mitch McConnell. But it's just the beginning. Because as you just saw, Zelenskyy has arrived in Washington to make more demands. He's the houseguest who would not leave. And every moment we tolerate him, the demands become bigger. In case you missed it. Here's part of what he said just a moment ago.

So the leader of a foreign government dressed in a sweatshirt waltzes into the United States Congress and starts demanding money. And then has the gall to tell the people sitting there, who are giving him tens of billions of dollars more of your money, that it is not charity, it's an investment. Really, what are the returns on that? And by the way, what's the point of it? What is the goal here? What's the justification for it? Do we have a historic debt to Ukraine? Do we have a historic animosity with a non-Soviet Russia? No, no. How do we win here? What's in it for us? Isn't this our country? And where do you get off talking to us like that? Do we hate ourselves so much? Do we have so little respect for the United States of America that we put up with that, that we'll applaud it? Thank you, sir. May I have another? What's wrong with us? What's wrong with our leaders? And where is this going?

784	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-why-all-hysteria-not-clapping-zelenskyy	2022-12-22 22:56:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Why all the hysteria over not clapping for Zelenskyy? | Fox News	"Fox News host Tucker Carlson gives his take on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's address to Congress on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

You can't even really call it news anymore. It's some kind of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" scenario on display every single day. Yesterday, last night, the president of Ukraine showed up in Congress wearing a green sweatshirt and cargo pants for maximum disrespect, and demanded the United States continue to spend more on his country's border security than we spend on our own. That actually happened. 

It was a pretty cheeky performance if you think about it. But like Sam Bankman-Fried before him, Zelenskyy put a salesman's gloss on what otherwise might look very much like a scam. So the tens of billions of dollars you'll be sending me is not charity, . It's not a gift. It's not like the 20 bucks you gave the homeless guy at Union Station this morning for a quart of vodka. No, it's not that at all. This money, Zelenskyy said, is, quote, ""an investment."" Oh, an investment. 

So what exactly are the terms of this investment now that we're talking finance? When do we get our dividend checks? Well, Zelenskyy didn't specify that. Though, at one point in his speech, he did provide a hint. Are the tens of billions of dollars you're sending me with no audit and no concrete proof of what I'm actually doing with it, will all that money be ""enough,"" Zelenskyy asked rhetorically. Answer: ""Not really."" 

""Not really."" In other words, the return on our investment in Ukraine will be more pitches for more investments in Ukraine. Give me money so I can demand more money. That's what Zelenskyy promised us last night.

And under certain circumstances, that might actually be fine. If nothing else, Zelenskyy is quite an audacious young entrepreneur with the kind of pluck and fast-talking shamelessness where you think, ""This guy is either going to wind up in prison or very rich, and maybe both."" And there are times when you might want to throw a kid like that a few bucks just to see where it goes. You don't know. 

But unfortunately, this is not one of those times. The United States is flat out of money and not just in some abstract PowerPoint presentation kind of way, where we show you graphs of the national debt and we all pretend to be shocked and horrified. No, no, no. The United States is broke in a real way, meaning we can no longer afford to take care of our citizens.

For example, 15 million Americans are about to lose their healthcare coverage under Medicaid. Now, these are people who got coverage during COVID, but will now lose that coverage thanks to a provision in the $1.7 trillion spending bill that's about to become law. As CNBC reports, governors of various states have informed the Biden administration that the cost of keeping all those people on Medicaid is ""too high."" And it is high. Undoubtedly, it is high. 

How high is it? Well, over the last three years since COVID began, the federal government spent about $100 billion in extra Medicaid payments to Americans. That's a lot of money. How much is it? Well, it turns out that $100 billion is roughly what Congress has sent to our fast-talking Ukrainian friend in the sweatshirt in less than a single year. Just for comparison, just you would know what the priorities are in Washington, your health care is just too expensive. Sorry. And your border is too. Can't afford it. But for the strongman who runs Ukraine, no cost is too high.

That's real. Does that frustrate you? Does hearing the details infuriate you as a citizen? Imagine if you went to Congress to plead your case. Maybe you showed up in a sweatshirt to tell them what you think. ""I'm an American citizen,"" you might say. ""I've lived here my entire life. I've paid taxes, I've followed the law. I've supported the system my grandfathers built because I believed in that system. And now because corrupt ghouls like Janet Yellen at the Fed, so completely devalued the US dollar and so completely hollowed out our economy, I can no longer afford to go to the doctor. As an American citizen, please help me."" 

So if you showed up on the floor of the House of Representatives wearing a sweatshirt and said that, what kind of response do you think you would get? Would the response look anything like this?

We're handling your money in the ""most responsible way."" Take our word for it. Take our word for it. And they clap like seals. 

But here's the interesting thing. Almost every person in the room clapped like a seal. So no matter what that man said -- Send me more money! I command you! Send me more money! We're taking care of it the most responsible ways -- they applaud, all of them, almost like they have to. 

Now there are 435 members of the House of Representatives, and they're Republicans and Democrats. And famously, they don't get along. They don't agree on anything. They can't even pass a budget because they disagree on everything very bitterly. And yet, when a foreign leader shows up in cargo pants to tell them lies and give them orders, they all applaud. That's pretty weird behavior in a democracy if you think about it. The fractious debate we hear so much about doesn't exist. And in fact, looking at the screen last night, it didn't really look like a democracy, to be honest. 

That's honestly what it looked like last night. You've got to clap. You get in trouble if you don't clap, so everyone just claps all the time. 

Clapping is mandatory as long as Zelenskyy is speaking. Now there were a few  That would include Matt Gaetz of Florida, Lauren Boebert of Colorado. And when they didn't stand up and applaud, they found out the hard way what happens to people who dare not to applaud. 

NBC News took off right after them. That was the headline for NBC. Its house ""historian"" Michael Beschloss declared this: ""For any members of Congress who refuse to clap for Zelenskyy, we need to know from them exactly why. We need to know why."" Thought crime alert. You've been reported as not applauding. Explain yourself, pleb. And then Beschloss went on television to drive home the point. Our sources have reported you are not clapping. Watch this.

We have a right to know why you didn't clap. We have a right to know your thoughts. You thought you were a free person, able to make decisions for yourself. You could love or hate whoever you wanted in a free country. But no, Michael Beschloss has a right to know why you feel the way you do. Do you love Putin? 

Why wouldn't you clap for a man who banned a Christian denomination? A man who arrested priests, raided monasteries, seized churches outlawed opposition media outlets, outlawed political parties that opposed him, threw his primary political opponent in jail. Why would you applaud for a man like that? Do you love Putin? Are you opposed to democracy? Explain yourself. That's what he's saying. That's what they're all saying.

It's absurd. What they're describing is the opposite of democracy. There's no democracy in Ukraine, obviously. Banning a Christian denomination. Shut up. But he did. 

So why all the hysteria? You've got two people who didn't clap for a foreign dictator, and Michael Beschloss gets red in the face. Why? Oh, almost everybody clapped for him. But a couple of people didn't. And Michael Beschloss can't handle that. What's going on here? 

Is it possible that the more ludicrous the lie they tell you, the fewer questions they can tolerate about it, the less dissent they can put up with because they fear the whole edifice might crumble if they allow one person to ask one reasonable question. It's possible that's what's happening. 

Remember when Joe Biden told us about Nord Stream? There were two stories. The first story was Joe Biden promised to blow up Nord Stream, the pipeline that brought natural gas from Russia to Western Europe. He's going to blow it up. Do you remember that? You're not allowed to remember it, but we remember it. And we saved the tape. Here it is.

Yeah. So he said it on tape. I'm going to do to that pipeline what I did to Corn Pop at the pool at Wilmington. I'm gonna take a chain to it. 

So he promises to destroy the pipeline. And then, so does his number two at the State Department, Toria Nuland. We'll destroy the pipeline. And then the pipeline is destroyed, and that hurts Russia. It eliminates Russia's leverage over Europe. Okay. So we know how that happened. 

But no, they told us. Russia did it. Putin blew up his own pipeline. That's how evil he is. That's how much destruction he wreaks. He doesn't just attack others. He attacks himself. Okay, now. That's what they told us. And some of us had questions about it. Is that really what happened?

Michael Beschloss and his friends didn't like that. Anyone who asked questions about what happened to Nord Stream, which, by the way, sent more carbon into the atmosphere than any manmade event in history. So if you care about the climate, maybe be a little worried about what just happened in Nord Stream. If you suggested that the administration, the Biden administration, had anything to do with that, including prior knowledge of it, you were a Russian agent. Really, is that right? Can you fill us in a little bit more? No, you're working for Putin. 

Foreign Policy Magazine, which used to be a real magazine, called any questions about what happened to  a ""Kremlin talking point."" Wow. Could it be they were lying? Oh, yeah, they were lying. Oh, they were lying.

The Washington Post, of all places, now reporting and we're quoting, ""some Western officials now doubt the Kremlin was responsible. Oh, you think. There's, quote, ""no conclusive evidence that Russia is behind the Nord Stream attack."" Okay, so it's a binary here. It's Russia against a Western coalition led by the United States. So either Russia blew up the Nord Stream pipeline or the Biden administration had a hand in blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline. Those are your two options. 

So if Russia didn't do it, then the people who suggested maybe the Biden people were behind it were 100% right. So you'd think in a free country, in a democracy, you would get to discuss that in public. But you can't. And the press corps is not going to help you. They don't ask questions. We don't have that anymore. Here's what we have.

So that kind of solves a mystery from last night. How can any self-respecting American sit there when some foreign dictator shows up wearing his workout clothes in the US Congress and starts demanding, with a very apparent lack of gratitude, that we send him tens of billions of dollars when we're running out of money? How could you sit and put up with that? And then drapes a Ukrainian flag in our Congress. How could you put up with that? 

Well, because you're not a self-respecting American. You have no self-respect. You have no dignity. You don't care. You'll say anything. You'll tell any lie. You'll repeat any talking point. And when someone from the DNC or the White House sends you a note by text, saying, ""Compare him to Churchill,"" you do because you have no self-respect. That's the problem. So while millions of Americans can't afford to go to the doctor and we have no border, our leaders and our media are imagining they're very close to Winston Churchill. 

Alright. So this is clearly some sort of weird psychodrama that a ruling class is engaging in that gives meaning to their otherwise barren lives. The problem is there are potential consequences that could end the world. So the other day, Lindsey Graham came out, the Republican from South Carolina, and said that he agreed with Joe Biden and Zelenskyy. The real goal is not to move Russian troops out of Ukraine, back to pre-February borders. The real goal is regime change in Russia. Watch this.

So it's really hard to overstate how crazy this is. And you don't want to play shrink and wonder about, you know, what emptiness at the core of Lindsey Graham's personal life causes him to identify so strongly with a country he's not a citizen of. Something's going on there. But the effect is incredibly reckless and crazy. 

Fine. What happens then? Well, the world's largest landmass falls into ungovernable chaos. And that country has the world's largest nuclear arsenal. What happens to all those weapons? In a country with a lot of people who hate us. Lindsey Graham has no idea. He doesn't care. He's not interested. He's not going to be here to find out.

And none of the lawmakers who clapped yesterday had any idea either. They're clapping for regime change. They're clapping for an uncertain and incredibly dangerous future. It's not getting the Russian military out of Ukraine. It's much more than that. And they don't want to know more. 

And you know what they don't care about? You, your health care, your southern border, your children, your schools, your country. They don't care.

785	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-lying-defined-politics-2022	2022-12-23 22:15:00	TUCKER CARLSON: Lying defined the politics of 2022 | Fox News	" Fox News host Tucker Carlson reflects on lies told by the federal government on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'

This is, believe it or not, one of our last shows of 2022. So naturally we got to thinking about the year that was. What defined it? Well, if you're living a healthy life, of course your relationships defined it. Politics is never the most important thing. The people around you are—your family, your friends, your dogs. That's where joy comes from, not from elections.  

Relationships mean much more to you than any stupid pronouncement Nancy Pelosi made over the last year from her compound in Napa. But still, politics do matter. They're not irrelevant. Nancy Pelosi's babbling do have an effect on your life. So, what defined the politics of 2022? Well, lying did. This was the year of lying. The people in charge tell an awful lot of lies. That's what we learned, and we know this for sure, because while they are avid and committed liars, they're not very good at it.  

Their lives are amateurish, obvious, pathetic, sad, and there's something kind of insulting about that. Don't take a leak on my boots and tell me it's raining, goes the old cowboy phrase. Don't tell me something we both know isn't true and expect me to believe it. When you do that, you assault my dignity. You diminish me. You treat me like a child. If you're going to tell me a lie, put some effort into it.  

Try something clever. Have pride of craftsmanship. Don't pull the same old dusty alibi off the shelf like a jar of expired spaghetti sauce and expect me to fall for it again.  They've been trying that for, well, 21 years now, with the still somehow secret 9/11 files and for nearly 60 years with the JFK assassination. At this point, no living American still believes them and none should, but they keep doing it anyway. Clearly, they think we have brain damage. It's frustrating to watch, but today we've decided to be amused by it. 

That seemed like the more positive option, maybe the most positive available under the circumstances. 

So here, ladies and gentlemen, are our favorite lies of 2022. We had an awful lot to choose from in making tonight's list from Paul Pelosi's late night crime scene to the endless propaganda about the Ukraine war, to the million non-existent Americans who actually didn't get new jobs in the third quarter of the year.

But we're going to start with what might be the dumbest lie ever told: Vladimir Putin blew up his own natural gas pipeline to Europe. Now, by doing this, Putin crippled his own economy and weakened his own strategic position in the middle of a war, but he did it anyway because well, just because that's the kind of evil behavior Vladimir Putin is famous for. He's so evil. He's not only a threat to us, a direct physical peril to Omaha, Bangor and San Jose. Vladimir Putin is so evil, he's an existential threat to himself. Stop that man before he blows up more of his own pipelines. That's what the media told us with a completely straight face. Watch.  

:  

 Russia is certainly the most likely suspect, says John Brennan and you can trust him when he says that because John Brennan was Barack Obama's CIA director. There's nothing shady about that guy. He's never been involved in any illegal murders or anything. He's got your best interests at heart. Let's put him on TV as a reliable foreign policy expert. He'll tell us the truth. You've got to laugh at this because, well, what's the option? And actually, John Brennan turns out to be reliable in at least one sense.  

If John Brennan says it, the opposite is almost certainly true and that was the case here. No, Russia did not blow up its own pipelines. That explosion was the work of the Biden administration. They signed off on it and we can tell you that tonight with confidence. The only remaining question is, now that we know for a fact that Joe Biden intentionally released more carbon into the atmosphere than any human in recorded history, can you continue to lecture the rest of us about global warming? We're thinking, oh, yeah, he can.

Biden certainly is the main qualification for doing that – soullessness. This is a man who showered with his own daughter, who smiles when he's mad. This man will say literally anything. If the Chinese military unleashed a deadly manufactured flu virus on the world, Joe Biden would blame you for it and actually, he did. People are dying of COVID, Joe Biden told us,because you have questions about an experimental mRNA shot that doesn't really work and whose long-term effects we can't know. You are the criminal here, not the Chinese government, because you're ""unvaccinated."" You must be punished. That was the message from the White House picked up and eagerly disseminated by Biden's equally soulless stooges in the media and here's one of them: Leana Wen, formerly of abortion giant Planned Parenthood, now of CNN.  

So, the unvaccinated might be ""enjoying freedoms,"" Fretted Leana Wen and everyone knows that under the U.S. Constitution, that's not allowed.  

Oh, what a difference a year makes. Now we know that everything Leana Wen told us on CNN was a lie, and we know that for certain, because, amazingly, Leana Wen just admitted it. This week, Wen acknowledged that actually this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. It's the opposite.  

The CDC, she said, has now determined that ""vaccinated people who never had COVID were at least three times as likely to be infected as unvaccinated people with a prior infection and a Lancet study"" continuing the quote) ""found that those who were vaccinated but never had COVID were four times as likely to have a severe illness, resulting in hospitalization or death compared to the unvaccinated who recovered from it."" 

I mean, what? So, the vaccinated are four times as likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID? Four times.  

So, it turns out that none of your vax propaganda was true. To put it mildly, it was all a lie. The question is, can we get our lives back now? How about our economy, our jobs? When's the part when you break down in wracking sobs of contrition and beg forgiveness for misleading the entire country in matters of life and death and hurting people? We look forward to that part, though, obviously not holding our breath. For now, it is satisfying enough to see a lie identified for what it always was.

and honestly, that's also the pleasure in watching the Sam Bankman-Fried saga unfold. Bankman-Fried was this weird, pudgy kid in a t-shirt who played video games during interviews, took a ton of pills, and could never quite explain the business model of his ""crypto exchange.""  

I mean, literally, from the first day, this guy was an utterly transparent scam artist. Your golden retriever could have smelled the fraud on this guy. It was that redolent. He stunk of it. But somehow the geniuses, the financial wizards at CNBC, had no idea. They fell in love with Sam Bankman-Fried. They wanted to be Sam Bankman-Fried. They told us Sam Bankman-Fried was the new J.P. Morgan. Here is a tape we are going to watch at least once a month for the rest of our lives. It's that good.

That wasn't 10 years ago. That was weeks, days, before the Sam Bankman-Fried fraud collapsed in on itself.  No. No, he's not. Actually, he is an accused felon who just this week was photographed shuffling along in handcuffs on his way to his cell. It's just so awesome. These people are ridiculous and that's the real lesson of Sam Bankman-Fried and we're going to enjoy every second of it.  

Now, it's a little harder to enjoy what's happening to the rest of the economy—inflation, especially. Inflation is one of those economic phenomena you don't need to be an MIT professor to identify. Has the price of things you buy every week gone up a lot? Oh, it has. OK, you've got inflation. Inflation is demonstrable.  

Anyone who claims otherwise is lying and everybody knows that and that's why even most politicians, people who lie about anything, don't bother to lie about inflation. It's just too easy to catch them, but some still persist in lying about it. They just enjoy the experience of lying. It makes them feel alive. Janet Yellen is one of those. Watch her here to tell you that the inflation you're experiencing every day is not real. It's a mirage. It's ""transitory.""

: 

Did you hear that? She's an economist. She's not a scam artist who got rich from bribes disguised as speaking fees from the big banks after she had been running the Fed. No, no, no, no. She's an economist and because she's an economist and you're not, she knows that there are many kinds of inflation. There's conventional inflation and there's something called transitory inflation and that's the kind of inflation you're not allowed to complain about, especially before midterm elections.  

You are commanded to ignore that kind of inflation and if it still bothers you, then you have to do your patriotic duty and get an abortion. That's the word from Janet Yellen, who as of tonight is literally our treasury secretary. 

So, Merry Christmas much-lied-to American people. At least you know who we're dealing with now. The good news is we can still be happy. Happiness is a gift from God, and even the Biden administration can't take it away.
